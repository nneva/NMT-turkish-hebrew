Former Serbian president Goran Hadzic, who fought Croatia during the war in the former Yugoslavia, is still at large.
The Hague tribunal indicted 14 war crimes and traditions of war crimes against him on 13 July 2004.
Hadzic, who served his house in Novi Sad on July 16th, is still on the run.
UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has accused Serbian authorities for failing to arrest Hadzic.
Rasim Ljajic, head of the Serbia-Montenegro Co-operation Committee for Co-operation with The Hague tribunal, said state officials have not been formed with Hadzic since September 2004.
Ljajic explained that he was in the family of Hadzic and that he would surrender him, but there is no consequences after the arrest.
He said the family has been dismissed and that the Serbian government has no information about Hadzic is still in the country.
Local media say the suspect was said to be hiding in a Orthodox monastery in a Orthodox monastery in the village of Fruska Gora, or in Bjela, Montenegro, but police say they did not know Hadzic.

Erdogan Says New Political Movement in Turkey
The government, led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been pushing for Turkey to bring the current parliamentary system as unfair and model.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 03 / 02 / 05
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said Turkey should take over the presidential system to meet long-term stability. [AFP]
Following the EU progress report on Turkey last year, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the government to resume a long-term debate on the country &aposs political structure, urging the current parliamentary system to improve a US presidency.
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek told lawmakers last month that such a change would bring stability to Turkey, so that EU membership targets will be fulfilled.
According to other managers from Erdogan and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), the current 75 year system is unfair, and there is no room for a crowd.
It is not a new.
In 1989, Tourism Special Oztoman was made during the presidency, but denied that Turkey was not ready for a US military system.
The new proposals, however, say some AKP lawmakers, should strengthen the judiciary as priority.
According to the prosecutors, a chairman of the presidency, which will be formed without these reforms, the government will have a lot of authority and will be able to open a doctor.
The main opposition Relations Party (CHP) has criticised the plan as an effort to overcome international groups.
Meanwhile, the head of the Turkish Industry and Studies Association, Omar Stari, said the government is not in accordance with the country, urging it to strengthen the current parliament system.
Following the mandate of the presidency, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer could end his mandate in April 2007.
If there is no request, Erdogan is believed to be nominated by Sezer.
Turkey, meanwhile, has also recommended the proposal that the electoral system to increase the number of minorities representing the EU is reduced to 5 per cent.
In the November 2002 elections, many parties were under the current climate.
The AKP won a large number of parties, which have won 35 per cent of the vote, and the remaining 10 per cent of the vote.
The government has acknowledged the need for better representation so far, but did not stop the message.
"We need to protect the electoral system that will continue," he said.
"It can be a reforms for the representation of political parties," he said, arguing that a smaller stage will create a division in parliament and that a smaller percentage will lead to stability.
Analysts say that at least nine parties won the seat of the amendment, the coalition and the bloc will be allowed.

Among other Central and Eastern Europe leaders met in Sofia on Wednesday (February 2nd) to launch a five-year initiative to improve the situation of Roma, the most defendant.
The former communist states, who joined the unprecedented project so far, have signed a declaration that will work to join the Roma communities.
"Our governments will work to eliminate discrimination and to improve unacceptable differences between the Roma and Roma," the statement said.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg, Hungarian Ferenc Gracancy, Ivo Sanader, Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and prime ministers Czech Pavel Neboc, Romanian Marco and Slovenia signed the document.
Among other international organisations, including the EU and the UNDP, the initiative of the World Bank and the Appeal Society Institute, is supporting the initiative.
"It is unacceptable that the majority of the Roma minority is not acceptable in a lot of poor conditions, which is a lot of poor conditions," World Bank President James Wolfen said in Sofia on Wednesday. "This is not acceptable, as it is unacceptable to European stability and long-term political stability."
The island lives between seven million and nine million Roma.
About six million people are in Central and Eastern Europe.
The group is one of the largest, poor and high-ranking minorities in Europe.
Among other groups who live in the children, the death rate is high, as well as 10 to 15 years.
Roma families are more children, and they are sent to schools if they were sent to schools, they are sent to school.
Education and sovereignty have more jobs, and potential employees are discriminated by the majority.
A new UNDP statement quoted the BBC as saying on Wednesday that five members of the majority population in Bulgaria and Serbia are limited to the poverty borders of Macedonia and Romania by three participants.
Everyone who lives in Romania lives in poor.
In Kosovo, there are only one of the principles of only 12 and ten Roma.
The Roma electricity debt in Macedonia is seven times less than a month.
As part of the initiative, every participation will implement a national action plan, including the criteria that need to meet by 2015.
Education will focus on four priorities, including employment, health and health.
It is also a reason for the creation of a team of mechanisms. The Romanian Education Fund has an estimated 43m-euro resources.
"We will not see something to do everything, sovereignty and something else," he said. "The initiative will have a opportunity to change this initiative and create a chance for the political will to change the history of the European communities as a whole."
Samaras sparked Greek party to ND
The votes in the new Democracy presidential race have been punished to Dora Bakoyannis, who was sentenced to his party.
By Maria Paravantes for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 01 / 12 / 09
"We accept the ND responsibility for the new war," Antonio Samaras said on Sunday (November 29th) after his victory.
The new leader of the main opposition party in Greece, Antonio Samaras, is a former foreign minister who served as the post.
On Sunday (November 29th), Samaras won the selection of the 7th president of the New Democracy.
"The people were speaking, the party speaks a strong and controversial debate," Samaras said, promising that the party would continue to protect its unity and differences.
Samaras was the former Athens mayor and the foreign minister of Costas Karamanlis, who was recently dismissed by the former Athens municipality, won a final victory.
Today, Bakoyannis, who has been optimistic for party management, won 39.5% of votes, but could be second.
A third candidate, Thessaloniki, Panagiotis, won 10.2% of the vote.
Bakoyannis celebrated both opponents after the vote, urging the New Democracy to democracy.
"It was elected the new leader of the ND," he said. "I am confident that the decision is respected and I would like to support thousands of supporters who have been repeatedly dismissed.
Today, the ND is taking a new term.
The party should not be able to become a broadcaster party.
We are all in this effort. "
Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou met with Samaras on Monday to meet with Samaras in a bid to find a political consensus.
"We hope to work together on national issues, because we need to dialogue and reconciliation," Papandreou said after the meeting.
Samaras vowed to support Greece 'interests, saying it would respond to the interests.
"Since some issues, we will work in some of them.
"We will work for the same country, because we will work on the same and the people, because we are optimistic," he said.
At the same time, Samaras met with former Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who resigned after his party resigned in the October 4th elections.
Samaras announced that the next party congress will be held at the autumn.
Political analysts say Samaras will regain the security of party supporters, as well as the fight against the ND.
Samaras, 58, has been serving as prime minister in previous governments.
In addition to its top diplomat, Greece was in the ministers of cultural and finance.
Samaras has repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly opposed the name dispute with Macedonia during the 1980-1993 Congress.
Athens has launched a campaign aimed at ensuring economic stability and ensuring the country to join international institutions.
Of course, Samaras has sparked the party from a move to the end of the government. In 1993, he was formed by the political leader of the political Bajram. In 1993, the party was not a long term in 2004.
The new Democrats' presidential elections were open for the first time.
They could not use the votes after the party has made it clear.
A number of 7,783 people were injured in the 1584 pollution centre.
Greeks who live in other EU countries have found a chance to vote for 64 stations abroad.
The party has reached about 1.5m euros in the party, due to a two-billion-euro salary for every election.
Serbian parliament approves Vojvodina Charter
Despite the opposition, parliament repeatedly rejected the province of Vojvodina in the north.

Vojvodina. [File]
Following a year after the government adopted the cabinet on Monday (November 30th), parliament ratified Vojvodina.
The delay was disappointed by the constitution and the ruling coalition and opposition members of the northern Serb province, which have more powers to the province.
According to the Serbian state news agency Tanjug, the current 163 lawmakers voted in the bill of 138 votes.
The opposition 'main objectives are the main city of Novi Sad, the largest city of Vojvodina, and the official office in the province has allowed to open agreements with the province to establish its own Science and Art Academy.
Following the changes of the Socialists' preparation last month, the Vojvodina smaller province and Serbia is recognised as an unilateral part of Serbia.
The amendments also noted that Vojvodina can open its European region and representatives in Brussels, and that Novi Sad is now recognised by the Serbian government.
Despite the amendments, the opposition is not unsatisfied.
Former Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, a member of the Democratic Party of Serbia, says that a decision on the borders of Vojvodina is dangerous for the integration of Serbia.
The party plans to apply to the Constitutional Court on this issue.
Other officials disagree.
Vojvodina Parliament Speaker Sandzak said the ruling coalition has shown political stalemate, saying it is only the beginning of the decentralisation and the region in Serbia.
Democratic Party leader Bojan Pajic, head of the Vojvodina administration, rejected charges that the new chapter is part of the region.
"Vojvodina will have more autonomy, but in other areas in Europe," Pajic said in a statement.
Socialist Party leader and Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Dacic said the amendments were "the biggest chance of autonomy" after the year, because the republic "is successful."
Serbia will not allow the borders of Vojvodina, he added.

EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday (November 30th) in Brussels that Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will be able to visa-free visa-free travel to Europe as part of December 19th.
EU officials, who advocate the decision, said it is a key step in the three countries' European integration process.
"Today, the decision reflects a clear signal to the Western Balkans and is a result of the effort to fulfil the requirements for the visa liberalisation of countries," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Monday.
European Commission (EC) Vice-President Jacques Barrot said the 27-nation bloc would "boost relations between the countries and our co-operation", citing the movement of Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian citizens.
Toolas Bildzeta, who currently holds the rotating EU presidency, described it as a "historic" decision ".
He added that Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian citizens who want to celebrate Christmas in the Schengen zone, will now do so as a visa.
It is the only biometric passport that citizens need to travel to all EU member states from Britain and Iran, and all EU member states, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.
However, the talks should not be able to spend 90 years in a six-month period, but they need to be exercised.
They need to work on a long-term visit to the process, or work for visa or work.
On Monday, the decision is not applied for the residents of Kosovo, because all EU countries have been recognised by the EU, and is not recognised by the visa dialogue with Western Balkan countries last year.
"This is a clear and clear step towards European integration," Serbian President Boris Tadic said at a joint press conference with Barrot and Rehn in Brussels. "It is not part of the EU accession talks, but not part of the visa liberalisation talks," he added.
Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who described the efforts to fulfil the visa liberalisation requirements in Skopje, said his country is a reason for "celebration" and said that this day, it would "be more difficult to celebrate the Macedonian history.
Turkish Cypriots discovered barricades in Nicosia
Following about 40 years after Nicosia was closed, the most popular employees of the Turkish Cypriots will resume for the beginning of Thursday, as a result of the rebels in the divided town.

One of the main symbolic symbols of Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriots seem to be removed by the end of this year, when the divided island of Nicosia began on Thursday (November 24th).
The peacekepers in the Ledza Street have been stopped for 40 years.
The first time was established in a campaign against the British administration in 1958.
Three years after Cyprus declared independence in 1960, the conflict between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriots caused the closure of Ledra Street.
At the same time, peacekepers were discovered in 1974, after the Turkish Cypriot community reacted to the northern part of the island.
Since then, the Venice city of Nicosia has been divided among communities, such as the rest of the country.
The UN forces' "Year" candidate for the island of 180km north of Cyprus and the Greek Cypriot south.
"We want to reunify the country," Semal Ausi, deputy head of the Turkish side of Nicosia KIs' Turkish side, told the AP on Thursday (December 7th). "This country will be the biggest way for Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots."
The latest international initiative to reunify Cyprus ended in April 2004, when UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan rejected a compromise plan by Greek Cypriots.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots voted to the EU in May, only the Greek Cypriot part of the Mediterranean Mediterranean island joined the EU last year.
More than a decade, the issues between the two communities have been restricted.
In 2003, however, Turkish Cypriots have allowed the Turkish Cypriots to open four border crossings, allowing more than a day.
The latest move is expected to return to the region and increase local trade with the possibility of opening new hospitals and logistics over the past decades.
Both sides are urging the business community to use their own authorities.
"The plans are ready," he said.
"This is a signal that the political climate is very optimistic," a local diplomat told Reuters on the move.
Greek Cypriots said they welcomed this surprise movement.
"If they open their entities, this is a good approach," said Greek Cypriot Mayor Mikis Zamlalas.
"We expect a number of concerns about security," Zamlas said, adding that "We are waiting for the UN to see a number of concerns about security in 1974."
However, he stressed, "it is ready to open them" if the Turkish Cypriots open.
In a separate development, the Turkish Cypriot government agreed on Tuesday to adopt a law aimed at resolving the property problems with Cyprus.
If the law passed by parliament, the law will require the Greek Cypriots' interests in the past 30 years, if it is not only used or no longer threaten to the public administration.

Romanian Economic Commission Approves Reconstruction in 2006
Romania faces many challenges this year.
If the conditions are approaching in the EU, local companies are more competitive.
As a result, industrial production and GDP growth was low.
Recent violence and food, as well as energy prices have been affected by the economy, as well as the increase in energy prices.
Among other international conditions, the economic stalemate and the rise of Asia economies in Europe has caused a trend to protection policies.
In this statement, Romania wants to meet its obligations on the EU, and it is very difficult to fight the business and political leaders of the world to fight the path towards membership.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 23 / 01 / 06
Local markets have to ensure that many local companies in the EU have been able to ensure that this new competitiveness is needed.
Romanian economic performance in 2006 is a rising risk.
Nevertheless, the general situation is possible to say that there is certain issues.
The local economy is also among the issues that have changed the conditions.
In 2005, industrial production was low by the previous year.
In the first nine months, only 2 per cent of the GDP is expected to reach 4 per cent of GDP in 2005.
The negative consequences could be linked to the risk of violence and food, which has been affected by the country.
The industrial sector in Romania, especially in certain sectors, has been worried that the country 'money is serious, the rise in energy prices is worried by the state support, and more competitiveness.
In addition, local markets have to be able to ensure this new competitiveness for many local companies in the EU.
This is a low reduction of production and GDP growth.
How will local companies continue in the coming period?
Do you emphasised that the decrease has been defined, or if this decrease will continue to continue?
Recent rates and risks have been affected by the country 'economy last year. [AFP]
If we have not yet reached the same border, we can recognise the figures in the coming months.
However, the demonstrations are not possible for the second quarter, but the industrial production in 2006 could be a major increase.
It will contribute to the process of improving its GDP growth, which will affect the increase of GDP.
This year, the hospital showed a very serious reduction of 12 per cent compared to 2004.
However, it is difficult to wait for optimism, if the producers of 2005 are low.
In 2005, the trade deficit continues to rise, while the current account deficit could be surprised by 9 per cent of GDP.
GDP and industrial production are a question that should be slowed by slowly: What is the sustainability of foreign debt?
In addition, there are many things that must be implemented on foreign deficit.
This year, the low prices are low, and I am convinced that I have been able to stay on the main competitiveness issues.
The economy is forced to see "the Netherlands" (Dutch "), due to a serious amount of money laundering for Romanian citizens who have been working abroad, and because Romania has been able to join the EU.
Overall, they do not see concerns about the "normal" in the banking sector and that the foreign currency in the banking sector does not mean a long-term and security loan.
But some allegations are limited.
The media is not the only challenge in the economy, but the process of a climate process is not surprised.
If such a protocol is entering the process, the foreign currency board will decrease serious, and this could be able to restore inflation.
The European Bank will give the inflation target this year as a new financial policy. [NBR]
The new monetary policy of the National Bank will give the balance of inflation this year, as a result of inflation targets.
It would be better to convince the implementation of this regime in 2005, as it has been implemented in the last four months of 2005, but it would be better to convince the implementation of the regime.
Discussions will be very difficult: about half of the money is being taken from the euro, and about half of the money is still under control of NBR 'control over the euro, the exploration of explosives and explosive explosives in bankruptcy and explosive loans are still being reduced by 5 per cent in 2006.
The rise in the prices is a 6.5 per cent target, if the price of inflation is expected.
Last year, the first target of 6.8 per cent was injured. The target, which was implemented by the tax rate, was 8.8 per cent.
In 2006, the public budget envisions a deficit of 0.5 per cent, but it is also controversial concerns about GDP growth and inflation.
They should be implemented by a budget deficit, and the budget should be implemented next year.
In addition, the infrastructure projects should be provided more funding.

The Democratic Union of Kosovo (LDK) has changed amendments since the government, and the party lives.
Following the elections in the country, the party will elect its own president.

In an exclusive interview with SETimes correspondent Linda Karadaku, Mustafa, the possible candidacy and LDK.
SETimes: How will you declare the LDK presidency candidate?
Ivica Mustafa: I think that the LDK presidency candidates will be good for a compromise.
I will be able to convince the head of the LDK presidency, the Sejdiu will be able to do everything that claims that Sejdiu is interested in the interests of the LDK leader.
I do not have any meeting with the events who want to support the candidacy candidacy and want to resign.
There is no connection with support from the public.
SETimes: How do you think that the LDK is realising the ruling coalition?

I think this can be acceptable between the government and the opposition.
Some laws -- the budget law, the privatisation of PTK, the election law and the Ahtisaari package -- should be reached.
I think that the agreement can be reached.
SETimes: How do you expect the creation of a Kosovo government?
Mustafa: We will have a completely unstable government, because we will have a post-election mandate.
SETimes: How do you win candidate for the party, and how do you have changed the parties?
Mustafa: I think that the LDK should be more open to the new generations, with young people in the party.
The new initiatives and ideas should be more open -- the LDK should be removed from the discrimination that only control owners should be exercised.
This party should provide supervised personnel and information to make Kosovo a different way.
This government is not a new factor, but the implementation of the rule of law, fighting corruption and poverty programmes.

"I think that [Turkey] can be students," the 22-year-old Libyan, said on Friday (June 22nd).
On Friday, 12 Libyan nurses and performances were one of the 12 Libyan churches and demonstrations in a bid to send pressure on the crowd in Black Sea.
The internationally built on the first day of the Islamic world has caused patients in diseases.
"They say that there can be a year of improvement, so I need to know what they are," he said.
The exhibition, which has invested in the Eurasian Hospital in Istanbul, has been sparked by Turkish soldiers' OHR 'branches, which enjoys three students of Libyan athletes and students.
"I am very important that the IHR is doing.
"I feel a real solution with Turkey," he said.
A Libyan disaster campaign, which is planning to bring the 70-Libyan car to Istanbul, has been launched.
"Our opponents were the first international NGO in Black Sea to help," said Murat Bajram, director of the IHR 'intelligence situation.
On February 22nd, the aim was reached four days ago in the city of King, five days after the reunification of the island.
The movement was made during a time when Turkish leaders have taken responsibility for NATO, while the Arab Church tried to leave their lives and explosives.
Ankara reported this week that the airport in Black Sea has taken steps to promote humanitarian aid to promote humanitarian aid.
Ankara and Gaddafi are trying to preserve a potential mediator with the churches and protecting the communications system.
"Libya is a difficult situation for Turkey, because it will be criticised by a coalition that will be created with the West.
Turkey, meanwhile, will be recognised as a country that has invested in investments, while the crisis is not a country that is facing, "he said.
As part of this hospital operations, the assurances are another demonstration of Turkey &aposs largest cultural and economic heritage.
According to Bacz, these details are in the process of enlargement and operating in challenges in the Middle East and different climate.
"Turkey has a Muslim country, especially with some Western aid organisations," he said.
However, he notes, the situation of IHR is more difficult.
In May last year, the Special Freedom Freedom, who is trying to help Gaza, was sparked to the international politics' role in the organisation, as well as for his role in organised crime.
Israeli soldiers discovered the Mavi Marmara mission and killed nine people, including the IHR fans.
As part of the political influence of the military, the death attacked the attack against the attack.
The Association rejected it, but believes it is an example of other Turkish libraries, the Bacolli organisation, which has been optimistic.
"The OHR has become a symbolic symbolic of collaboration with the ideology, and many other Turkish people do not want to see this road."
He added that organisations in the Middle East have not been satisfied with the time when ideological psychological circumstances have been met.
So far, Haykram has shown that the work is not on a strategic agenda, and cautioned that the work has frozen discrimination in other countries, including Japan and Haiti.
However, all are not very important in the European Hospital, one of the Black Sea churches' words, one of the most popular sites in Turkey.
"Everything else people in the street are going to see us," he said. "We have offered a offer and questioned that we need a job."

Most years ago, a prominent researcher who was known as "injured" in the country, is now facing prison because he said.
Istanbul prosecutors charged Orhan Pamuk on Wednesday (August 31st) that his country has been charged with its national character for his remarks about Armenian and Kurdish massacre.

"If the law and institutions respect the respect of the law and the rights of democracy and freedom.
However, the law enforcement is cautioned, and if the force does not see its main role in state institutions, "he said.
Kemal lawmakers called on "democracy, institutions and institutions" to protect the role of institutions and institutions ", but not only with the law," he said.
"There is no chance that the world is not in the world, prices, Mladic and weeks.
"It should not be able to convince our lives and protected life," he said.
Michael called for developing infrastructure, which is a major sector in Romania, as well as development in the country.
"It is a part of our force as an independent state," he stressed.
"This country is not only our country to make a stable, sustainable, compromise and the entire world," said King Michael Michael. "I see Romania as a country that has been taken by our children, but also as a country that has been taken by our children."
They emphasised the importance of this process and are resolving the message.
"The speech of the King has a historic decision," Iulian Pirte-Isulescu, a number of media reports on history and Romanian monuments, told SETimes.
"The past is the basic idea of Romania, and the basic idea of Romania, the country was not said to have nothing in a speech in a speaking on the basis of respect, the country &aposs poorer, prices, identification, chemical and immunity.
"There is two world recognition: a Romania, which is still in the door of the door, which is still in the door of what is not easy," he said.
The council cited many of the Roma.

I feel that this is the need for Romania in the coming days, "he said.

Kosovo and Serbia are planning to implement a deal on free movement of human trafficking on 1 November.
The agreement was made during talks in Brussels during the summer period of EU membership.
Edita Tahiri, head of the Kosovo negotiating team, said the illegal facilities should be changed with plans to represent the RKS and KS barricades that will represent Kosovo after independence and the UNMIK administration.
"We have done [in] with [the] KS [in the resort," Tahiri told SETimes.
However, Tahiri 'Serbian counterpart Borko Stefanovic told SETimes that the RS plan will not be allowed to join Serbia.
The deal could be more difficult because the restructuring of the rest is set by November 20th, when it comes to hospital issues such as identification, chemicals and traffic insurance.
Stefanovic said that if Kosovo authorities are unacceptable, it would affect the effects.
"There is no reason for that time, it is really conciliation.
So far, Albanians in Kosovo are likely to take their identity, but the Serbian authorities will be able to remove their identity in Serbia.
"The Serbian entity has a obstacle," Tahiri said. "The Serbian side refused to see the conclusion of free movement of free movement, and is creating uncertainty problems that the EU rejected."
Tahiri said the identity demonstrations should show a valuable response for both countries and exercise.
However, this is the problem of consultations.
"The Serbian entity insists on the elements that are not connected with European principles, and they want more efficient and unacceptable challenges," Tahiri said.
"When it wants to prove that a dozen is proud, the identification and initiative has shown that it has been trying to prove it," said Dan Zeka, the chief political adviser to Tahiri.
A photography will not be photography and will not only be photography.
"If there is no chance, the people should be able to have a chance [to] that revealed that it has been hiding."
Tahiri said that this model has been taken by other countries, such as Greece and Macedonia.
Kosovo analyst Belgium Beqaj is approaching the situation and told SETimes that the agreements with Brussels cannot be implemented without "legal mechanisms".
The only agreement, which is being implemented at this point, was in the trade zone for customs stations.
Other three -- free movement, freedom of movement, flexibility and universities -- still awaits to implement.
November 20th, the EU Council of Ministers was selected as the target for the enlargement decision in mid-December.
"The implementation of the agreement on free movement of free movement will be a bad image for Serbs in Kosovo, because it is not a bad truth," said Bogdin Koljevic, a political analyst at the New Serbian Policy Academy and.
"Kosovo Albanians can move on the territory of Serbia and Serbs -- and Serbs will not have such a movement.
These agreements were signed by the Serbian side, "he said.

The Mediterranean, a small coastal coastal in Turkey, has started to seek alternative energy mechanisms for three years ago, as the state has been used to use the poverty of the market, which has been used for smaller electricity bills and the liquidity of people.
Another 365 people have refused to pay their billion-euro bills for economic reasons and the local government.
Following the incident, writer Mustafa Czech proposed to build a wind power plant to produce energy.
"I think that there was a small number of years ago and I think we can build a new mechanism for the water market," he told SETimes.
The idea of this idea was transferred to the Black Sea municipality and also met with them.
"They were very low," he said.
Its municipality and the Ankara energy company, Sandal and Industry, began to build wind wind power operations in July 2008.
They were working in the construction, and the government and the Sandzak did not have to work for work.
The 500-Wret energy operator has allocated 210,000 TL.
The state has offered 140,000 TL, while the rest of the money is met with the people of the Mediterranean.
Following the search, the villages are expected to wait for two years to connect the state power utility.
"We have to expect the laws to change.
Officials in Ankara have suggested that we will not contribute to the state power utility, while authorities in Ankara say they are awaiting for us, "he said.
Turkey, a country that has a huge current current account deficit, is seeking to facilitate more energy in its own territory.
"Turkey is now developing the first local production plant," the largest project in the local media.
The project includes the National Reconstruction Agency for Reconstruction and will become operational next year.
Another residents will not have to wait as soon as possible to start energy production.
According to Czech, more than 5,000 can be operated.
They are estimated that the wind power operator will spend a year -- 300-300-30-year-old TL austerity.
According to former Muammar Ahmet Albert, some environmental villages have shown interest in creating their own wind energy operations.
"Iznik [arrived] to one of the 30 minutes [the Mediterranean]," he told SETimes.
In the 1970s, the second largest village of the Mediterranean, but now one of the small villages in the region.
Most of the coupled to Budapest, and the villages are more than 65% of the villages.
The hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of wind energy operators hope that the Mediterranean.
"The 31-year-old society plans to transport the village, but it decided to stay because of the wind energy operator," he said.
In the next few years, the existing energy operator plans to change further growth.
"We want to build a greater wind power operator to sell other villages in the region," he said.

In March 26th 1999, the population of Kruga, a small village in Prizren -- 82 and 145 books -- was killed and killed by 700 people of Serb forces (14 per cent) in the village of Prizren (14 per cent).
Officials have already been able to identify only 23 people so far.
Since the war, there are about 2000 -- about 91 people and 91 people from the village of Kruga.
So, six Albanian men were injured and managed to survive.
One of the foundations, Shahu, died two players, three cars and seven others.
Following the ancient pieces, Macedonian pieces were killed.
Among the suspects of the Druga Voice massacre were recognised by former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague.
Today, Kruga Vodafone is a typical Kosovo village that has been created by children and institutions.
In the village of Ergenekon, more than 70 per cent of the Islamic population, women have to leave their families and boost their children.
Domas, explosives and doctors are selling at the Prizren market.
Most of them, the social aid for 45 euros a month ago.
Agron Limani, 41, is a book on the events in the war, as it has announced the needs of hydropower and services.
Limani says living conditions in the village are very difficult.
People are also seeking to seek basic food, such as the weapons, smaller, water and architecture.
"We are always money," Limani said, adding that "a small business will be more beneficial to create a smaller enterprise in the Kruga Vodafone, as soon as possible."

In 2006, the Kosovo National Assembly passed a law that envisions special funds for journalists and civilian victims.
The data began in March 1st 2008.
In July 2007, the government started preparing a draft law on the families of people.
Local and international organisations are helping representatives of their families and their families to promote the law.
The bill envisions the right of the money for students and information.
At the same time, people are planning to be allowed to ensure that they do not pay for their losses.
Authorities have been very convinced to ensure the judges.
The Institute for War and Peace Relations (IWPR) said that their families would ask their families' extradition to the rights of 54 Serbs and two Roma, who are responsible for the end of March 1999.
The families of local NGOs have signed an agreement in Kosovo, and have launched a trial in Pristina.
"So far, justice has been triggered for the war in Kosovo, but it is not a fair to benefit from the same reason for those who do not prove to prove that there is no evidence in the fight against organised crime," said IWPR, the Belgrade Centre for Human Rights.
IWPR said the supporters and their families will be removed in a way of war crimes, but at least, it believes that Kosovo Serbs will be able to return to the region.
War crimes cases are still under way.
The new European Commission in Kosovo has to discuss judges and prosecutors.
Such cases that have been injured over the past ten years will be one of the most difficult tasks.
However, the families of men are seeking a clear signal that they will not survive by the end of the riots.
"[Justice] has yet to find it," Limani said.

Therefore, Macedonia is continuing its commitment to our leaders and citizens, our neighbours, our neighbours and the entire region, dialogue, co-operation and compromise strategy.
We have repeatedly revealed a political climate, because Macedonia wants to stop the problem.
Our partners, partners and in the EU and NATO, as well as many Greek leader know that a compromise would not be able to provide some of our countries.
For this reason, it is not a real truth or friendly, which will not be a precautionary or friendly.
Therefore, all solution and consensus in the future are "consensus" that will be able to reconciliate our people, or not to respect the identity of the people. "
However, such consensus, values and identification of our people can be found by the country &aposs political leaders.

Serbian lawmakers are preparing a declaration that condemned all war crimes committed during the former Yugoslavia.
The document is expected to be completed on Tuesday (June 14th) and is expected to discuss the declaration at the executive parliamentary session this week.
The parties, however, are not able to reach an agreement on the basis of the declaration.
The Democratic Party of President Boris Tadic insists that the document is also part of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
According to Radio B92, others argue that they would be charged with war crimes against Serbs.
During a meeting last week, party representatives agreed to "condemn all crimes committed during the war in the former Yugoslavia and urged the authorities in Republika Srpska to" seek to investigate and hand over all key suspects that are believed to be effective and effective war crimes. "
"The crimes against civilians in Srebrenica and Bratunac should not be repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly," the bill said, noting that "a crime should not be done in the years, and that the Serbian Parliament is expected to convince all countries in
According to Serbian Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic, "the aim is to change the highest state officials to condemn war crimes and change people to worry about crimes."
"I believe that we have made this success," Markovic said.
Serbian Constitutional Court head Slobodan Vujanovic said the declaration is a political action and that any legal action on the Serbian judiciary will not have a concrete impact on the work of investigations or investigations commissioners.
According to Vujanovic, the document will now be "a strong political and individual message".
Opposition reactions have been mixed.
Some civil society organisations and actions say the document does not meet.
Speaking at a conference on the Srebrenica massacre on Saturday, Natasa Candic, director of the Humanitarian Law Centre for Human Rights, said the bill "is still ready to complete the past.
Meanwhile, legal professor Vojislav Dimitrijevic criticised the parliamentary initiative as "huge".
He said such a declaration should be approved by five years ago.
The parliamentary move came after a Serbian television broadcaster, which showed the murder of six Bosnian Muslim men.
Croatian police announced on Tuesday that a man believed to be believed to have been arrested among members of the Appeals group.
The Serbian government has detained several former Appeals officers, who have been charged with murders.

The ministers have agreed that a general stage on expansion of expansion could be made by both potential member states and financial markets.
"The Council of Europe has repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly reaffirmed the results on the enlargement of 16 December and underlined the need for full implementation," Reuters quoted him as saying.
EU leaders agreed on October 3rd as a date for the start of accession talks, and agreed that it is a protocol that would meet economic and political reforms, as well as the customs agreement with the Union, including Cyprus.
EU foreign ministers reportedly ratified the protocol on Monday, and sent the document to Ankara.
So far, Turkey is expected to sign the document over the past few weeks, fulfilling all conditions for Brussels' accession talks.
Another candidate is that Croatia has made progress in full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
EU ministers vowed on Monday to reunify the issue of Croatian membership talks at a meeting on July 18th.

The Adriatic Group decision to boost regional security and its members' joint approach to NATO membership before the NATO summit next month, analysts say.
The Adriatic Group -- the defence ministers of Albania, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- signed a declaration last month that NATO wants to continue its "open door" policy "on membership in Chicago, during a meeting in Skopje.
"NATO is the best exhibition of regional security.
Regional countries in the region are working to improve defence billions and to not be disappointed, "he said.
Lazarevski, an analyst at the Apppen Safet Institute, told SETimes that the declaration is ready to join the Alliance as a regional group.
"It is an important step in the process of accession, which is prepared to join the defence system and increase growth," Lazarevski said.
The candidates for NATO members Croatia and Albania are widely important, he said.
"Croatia and Albania are still in the Adriatic Contact Group, which is still more political," Lazarevski added.
Military and security analyst Petar Shrabina told SETimes that the conference in Skopje is also intended to prepare Kosovo and BiH for NATO membership.
He said that this is not participating in Serbia 'meeting.
"US Secretary of State for Kosovo should be a candidate for NATO membership.
This plan should be done soon.
Agim Ceku was in Skopje with the Kosovo Defence Minister, "he said.
"The candidacy of BiH will be the problem due to the status of Republika Srpska," he said.

"This is the most important solution.
Macedonia could become a member of international organisations, "the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", the interim agreement says.
Greece has accepted this decision, "he said.
The group said it must take steps to implement a multiethnic airline.
The group also called for a joint regional projects, such as enhancing co-operation with a unique and improving co-operation in all education centres.

"This is a clear decision to reduce regional security and threats."
Former Macedonian Foreign Minister Srdjan Kerim said the next step should be formed to establish a similar regional council in the North Council in Switzerland to develop energy, infrastructure, transportation, food and environmental projects.
Some Balkan countries can be implemented, and this model can join different projects.

The two main political groups will face the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Croatian Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Croatian Peoples' Party (HNS), the Croatian Peoples' Party (IDS), Iceland 'Party (HSD) and the Croatian Elections Party (HSB) will face Sunday (December 4th).
According to the latest public polls, the Chief has a major lawsuit against the HDZ in the widespread corruption scandals.
Croatian State Election Commission (DIP) spokesperson Hrvoje Sadaric told SETimes that the Commission has made reports on the campaign financing and will prepare a report on any national division.
"During the election campaign, the data showed that the previous parliamentary elections in 2007 were a decline.
The law on the financing of political activities and electoral campaigns in this parliamentary elections has been implemented and increased transparency, "Sadzic said, adding that around 4,000 registered observers will be monitored.
Experts and experts have described the campaign as a major campaign, saying the party places and programmes are the same.
Boris Pavelic, a journalist from the Zagreb daily Novi List, told SETimes that the HDZ is unfair.
"The HDZ seems to see any reason after all scandals.
However, the Customs coalition has a major atmosphere because it is not able to deal with certain problems such as [scandals], "he said.
The HDZ emphasises more national identity, while coalition leaders are trying to raise tensions and improvement.
Zdravko Pejko, a professor of political scientists in Zagreb, described the campaign as "very difficult" and said the parties have nothing to encourage the people to vote.
"I can say that in the previous years, I can say that the political parties in Croatia are not aware of the ideology.
For example, a different party is closer to the Catholic Church.
"The health system, education and other social problems should be more important," he said.
He added that the campaign has not made any new way, and that Croatia will have a different government after the December 4th elections.
Officials from the coalition are expecting good results, as the public is unable to have the government.
"Some people in the current government [are] likely to vote [this year], and this could be a better way for the option of the option of optimism," Dusko Kisner, spokesperson of the Iceland Democratic Assembly (IDS), told SETimes.
However, the ruling HDZ continues to play "nationalism", and polls say the law would vote in a major party.
"I am convinced that the HDZ has a traditional voters in Bosnia and Herzegovina and I am confident that this elections will be successful.
However, the participation of the number of polls is likely to be low.
However, the results will not be a problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina, "he added, adding that about 300,000 BiH Croats are expected to vote.
The HDZ shows full support for the EU integration process, while about 40% are still opposed to EU membership.
Zagreb Stephen Tripovic told SETimes that he would vote, but that politicians will not be able to speed up with their citizens.
"The last time for a dozens of dozens," he said.
Everything, students, teaching teacher, [the] EU], I think we will feel that we will feel this, "he added.
Zagreb pensioner Nadic told SETimes that he would not vote because it is "better things".
"I would not use it.
Both government will be the same.
The election will not be elected, but the pension will not be done.
I do not expect this election couple, so that we can end the attack on our idea and proposals, "he said.

Despite talks with US President Barack Obama, analysts say the US visit to Washington will continue its role in talks with Serbia last week. [Reuters]
Analysts in Kosovo believe the US visit to the United States last week is a key step towards continuing its role in tensions with Serbia and to protect the Kosovo EU integration process.
Thaci visited Washington to discuss the role of Kosovo in the Balkans.
Prime Minister Hillary Clinton met with US Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday (April 4th).
Thaci asked the United States to continue its role in all Western Balkans, not only in Kosovo.
"Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has asked US Vice-President Biden to play an important role, and that Kosovo wants to continue to become one of the supporters of the Euro-Atlantic structures," the prime minister said in a statement.
He reiterated the United States' support for Kosovo 'sovereignty, and congratulated Thaci for Pristina for progress in the dialogue with Pristina.
"The United States supports a strong dialogue and expects the implementation of agreements between Kosovo and Serbia to benefit the citizens of both countries," he said.
Following talks with Clinton, Thaci said all countries in the region share a common goal for European integration and NATO membership.
"However, we have to need strong interest and preservation of the United States and the EU, not only in Kosovo, but also in the rest of the Western Balkans," he added.
Kosovo and Serbia have reached a compromise that allows him to represent itself "Kosovo". "It is a condition for this name status, and the 124-strong UNHCK and the United States on the independence of Kosovo is in accordance with the ICJ."
At the beginning of the agreement, representatives of both countries agreed on how Kosovo will recognise the EU candidate status.
Serbia announced on May 6th that the presidency, parliament and local elections will hold Kosovo.
Pristina has threatened to block the elections that will be held within the borders, and to block the force.
US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Reconstruction and Operations Ibrahu said the United States continues to preserve the presence of the territorial integrity of Kosovo.
"I think that the North issue should be resolved by Kosovo, as well as all rights in the international friendly and the Serb citizens in the north should be resolved," Ibrahaj told SETimes.
Ramadan Ilaku, the founder of the Movement for Kosovo "Following the Movement" (SP), says Kosovo politicians have been closed to the EU foreign policy, especially with Kosovo.
"Kosovo wants the United States to play a role in the final negotiations.
This visit is aimed at encouraging the United States' support for Kosovo, the support of the agreements with Pristina and Belgrade to encourage Thaci to continue this process, "he said.
The situation in northern Kosovo is unstable and a new interim agreement should be a process, "he said, adding that" the parallel system in the north, such as Gracanica and Shkodra municipalities "should lead to the general system of the Kosovo state."

ICTY spokesperson Nerry Jelacic. [Nererim Jelacic]
Since 1993, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is trying to hand over responsibility for war crimes committed during the Balkan conflicts.
SETimes correspondent and war crimes suspect Nermar Jelacic discussed challenges and continued heritage in the past.
SETimes: The ICTY is seeking to hand over war crimes and promote justice to the victims.
What is the biggest challenge in the court?
Nexercise Jelacic: The court has faced the number of challenges since the first day.
As a result of the local courts' failure to investigate and prosecutors, it was the first example of the conflict.
In this case, he faces a couple of tasks, such as intelligence and procedures to co-operate with the state, investigating investigations and evidence, and to create the functioning of six units, managing and protecting witnesses, as well as protecting witnesses.
First cases are not the beginning of a challenge, such as the unprecedented cases, it was necessary to ensure that the trial should be taken as possible as soon as possible.
It is also higher than in 2003, with the completion strategy that would not be able to bring the courts to any effective effect.
The office of the court is also planning to hand over operations that have contributed to peacekeeping and stability. In 1999, the court has established a Social Policy programme, which is the first example of its work in the international judiciary in a bid to approve the work of its work in the region.
Now, one of the biggest challenges is the court 'heritage.
To complete its mandate, the court is crucial to the continuation of its heritage, even after the closure of its doors.
SETimes: How do you protect the immunity of judges in the ICTY, as many of them participate in the national effect?
Jelacic: A judge is the mandate of a judge to fulfil the participation of law enforcement standards.
All judges in the court are very professional and supervised.
The judges have promised their decisions only to prove evidence in the court.
SETimes: How will you elect a case that is the biggest effect on the ICTY work, or a return point?
Jelacic: There is no chance to elect a certain case.
All cases have played a step forward to the victims and make it an important role in bringing them as well as a reputation and putting them.
And all, the international penalty and humanitarian law has a significant role in the development of the law.
SETimes: How do you expect the ICTY to complete its tasks?
Jelacic: The court is still at the latest Constitutional Strategy Report, which was submitted to UN Security Council President Chairman last week.
The next report is set to be prepared in this year and all measures needed to complete all remaining work by the end of December 2014.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (SAR), which will start working for the ICTY next year, will begin in 2013.
In the second part of this interview, Jelacic argues that the ICTY is preparing to prepare the implementation of local courts in the Western Balkans.

"This proposal can contribute to reducing tensions.
KFOR, however, seems to see a real impact on the positive proposal, "he said.

"The progress in the dialogue will help Pristina and Belgrade closer to the EU and help them on European goals.
Both sides should be stopped in talks, credible, credibility and active for the interests of Kosovo and Serbia, as well as the interests of the region. "
Serbian Ministry of Kosovo Secretary-General for Kosovo Aleksandar Ivanovic told SETimes that KFOR is seeking to create a challenge in order to secure Serbia ’ s EU membership bid on December 9th.
"Serbia does not defend its interests in the coming days, but the Kosovo Serbs could need to be needed in July, despite a unilateral action aimed at ensuring Pristina," Tadic said.
"We have no final goal, such as Barisa Malovic, but there is no question that the barricades will be removed to the City and Brnjak.
We fear that Kosovo special police are protecting the VMRO-SB, because it would mean the end of all relations with Serbia.
However, our country has to leave our own, it must say.
As many as hundreds of people, President Tadic has repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly supported us as an alternative to Europe, "he said.
Malovic said Kosovo Serbs need Serbia 'support because they are not from other countries.
"This constitution should be a constitutional problem and that is the president of the mayors, and it is here to avoid the public," the mayor said.
Bogdin Koljevic, editor-in-chief of the newspaper of the New Serbian Political District, told SETimes that Serbia has a negative effect of insufficient and insufficient position.
"What we have been in the past months is a stalemate and we don ’ t think that Serbia is very happy, and we don [do] do not think that something has changed," he said.
There is no doubt that all Serbs in the north and the Serbs in northern Kosovo are not a sign of Serbia 'EU candidacy.
Even though Serbia is a repeat to meet Kosovo and EU policies, it is unlikely to be done. "
Koljevic insisted that Kosovo Serbs should not be implemented to decide whether to decide whether they will be made.
Malovic said all meetings and agreements were taken by the chief negotiator Borislav Stefanovic, so far the Kosovo Serbs who have to use Kosovo plants and have to go to any kind of discrimination with Serbia.
He said all, Stefanovic refused to reject such a possible possibility, but that Kosovo customs officers have been insisting that the agreement would be replaced by Kosovo customs officers.
The Serbian government has established a delegation of Mesic and First Protection Agency that will help enhance the management and technical issues and progress.
Aleksandar Jugovic, a member of the Serbian Renewal Movement, told SETimes that Serbs in northern Kosovo accept proposals from Serbia and that dialogue is important for them.
"They were completely completely completely, Kosovo Serbs' interests and the interests of Serbia.
The Serbs should be removed from the barricades, because KFOR will use its authority from the Kumanovo Treaty, it would be a disaster for Serbs and all in the southern Kosovo and Italy.
They should be removed, "he said.

More than a week after Serbia &aposs EU candidacy, Serbian President Boris Tadic and KFOR urged Kosovo Serbs and KFOR to boost tensions and urge Kosovo customs duties in late July, when local Serbs and Serbia protest the removal of Kosovo customs duties between Kosovo and Serbia.
On Tuesday (29 November), Tadic urged KFOR to end its peacekepers to end the risk, saying that the operation is dangerous, and that citizens have no contribution to the situation in the north of Kosovo.
"Members are helping Serbia to assist its national interests in Kosovo and Metohija, and are dangerous to danger.
"The fight against Serbs must be removed, removed of the government and to ensure transportation and communication," he said.
During a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Thursday, Tadic 'call for EU Foreign Affairs and Security Council High Representative Catherine Ashton.
"The violence in the north are very worried, and I think that we can make progress on the path of Europe," Ashton said.
However, representatives of Serbs in northern Kosovo have responded to Tadic to call.
Kosovo mayor of Mitrovica Krstic Panic told SETimes that Tadic "" is a surprised surprise in the peacekepers and other Serbs in northern Kosovo. "
He said that the representatives of the municipalities in northern Kosovo will not give their own positions, but they should consult lawmakers in the municipalities.
Kosovo citizens of Mitrovica Milos Z. told SETimes that Tadic has not been calling for the removal of the barricades but has not been calling for it.
"We are working in four months.
How do you think we need to be removed from the parents?
"How did you have to remove us after the conflict with KFOR on September 27th?" he said.
Milos believes that this is being made at the EU summit on December 9th, when Serbia will decide on potential candidacy.
"We are not fair to assault us, and we are trying to live in the state of Serbia for 12 years, and we are now very active in the position of Tadic," Milos said.
Authorities believe that Tadic is a major return to Kosovo policy.
"The call for Tadic was the last time before December 9th, when Serbia will not receive candidate status," Ian Bank, founder of the Transnistrict Organisation for resolving the conflict in the Balkans, told SETimes.
"This is a bill that would be designed to satisfy the European countries, especially in Germany, urging Belgrade to make more consequences of its own image in the north," he said.
"The problem is that Tadic wants Europe to ask more than it can be able to give the party institutions in the north.
"The latest attempt to send the EU will not be enough, and it will be worried that the EU will be worried in a selection of the requirements for Kosovo, which is increasingly increasing," he said.
However, director of the Kosovo Compromise project, Alandar Mitic, said Tadic 'call was not a surprise, because it is "a huge political policy" that is under pressure.
"He called for the removal of the barricades, and also urged Tadic to remove him to rescue any responsibility for any violence in Berlin, but also to do everything in the authority of Berlin, but also to do everything on Serbs in northern Kosovo," Mitic said.
According to Observers, Tadic 'call was not enough to candidate status this month, but the status of the status status talks with the EU is not a special importance for the start of negotiations with the EU.
"However, Kosovo Serbs are not safe and Pristina will continue to block its authority in northern Kosovo or not to block it," Mitic said.

Since the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 2002, opposition parties have not played an important role in Turkey 'foreign policy agenda.
However, the political conclusion of the Republika Srpska (CHP) over the past decade could change.
Opposition party party party CHP five broadcasters -- Ottoman Corridor, Gen Bilhan, Ukrainian Orhan, Farmar and general adviser Farmar Laroglu visited Washington in late March, bringing new foreign policy package ahead of the June 12th general elections.
Loglu, a number of meetings with Turkish ambassador to the former US ambassadors, told SETimes that "The highest level is being met with a high level of interest".
"Our foreign policy platform that we have presented US partners is on the principles of transparency and transparent principles of transparency," Loglu said.
Ottoman Corridor, the son of the sixth Turkish President Fahman Corridor, believes the AKP has changed the international image of Turkey.
"Today, we have questioned the restrictions on human rights in the region," he said, adding that "Today, there are no questions about the role of Turkey in its role in the region," he said.
"For example, many Western Europe shows that Turkey has not shown full support for social movements in the Middle East today, while the AKP is seeking to get the votes of citizens in the country," he said.
"We are very worried about the concerns of the Western Balkans' concerns about Turkey 'relations with the Western Balkans." The fact that the country is democratic. "
"I think that all these are the opposition, and we are acceptable to this right, and this is considered a official opinion of Turkey by all the world.
We have not been hiding from our people or international partners, "he said in Washington, adding that Turkey is at the same time in Eastern Europe."
"Our countries have a partnership between our countries, but we do not mean that Washington has to support the words."
Jusuf Tunin, a political scientist at the Ankara Institute for Strategic Strategic Studies, says all parties are focusing on foreign policy campaign, but that people in the Middle East have shown interest in the first time -- due to discrimination in the Middle East policies.
"The AKP is good, and this is not trying to support the West."
"However, the CHP is different," he said, adding that the main opposition party is a basis for political policy.
"The Turkish people have become more active, and the country has become an important role in international relations.
"The outcome of AKP policies will be discussed in the June 12th elections."
Still, the elections are expected to be made by the AKP and protect the CHP as the main opposition party.

However, a experts working at the Marshall Fund say that if these steps are taken.

According to a recent survey by the US public policy agency Marshall Fund (GMF), the Turkish people have started a serious number of violence against the United States and Europe, and the current consensus for foreign direct reconciliation to Western.
Addressing the 2007 initiative, Transylvanic suggests that Turks continue to decrease support for EU membership and the United States have been criticised by both the EU and the EU.
The rise in the United States was dropped from 11 to 11 years in 2007, with a "model".
The 18-24 young Turks, both the United States (15) and the EU (28), are worried more than the average of the country.
"In the past two years, the major problems in foreign policy have been very difficult for Turkey, because the PKK has been suspended and suspended in Iraq," said Ian Luker, a senior Turkish experts. "I believe that this is still a process of restructuring.
Washington and Brussels are possible to take steps. "
He cited the importance of the EU perspective in Turkey, saying one of the most important steps will be taken into the country as a serious reputation.
"The Turkish people are very important to the concerns of allegations by Americans and Europe.
Washington and Brussels have emphasised the importance of Turkey as a international player, "he said.
Over 40% of respondents are still positive for EU membership, but this is slow.
The figure is lower than 14% last year, and 33% compared to 2004.
Meanwhile, Turkey has been repeatedly recognised by disputes and other issues on Cyprus, and some bloc members -- France President Nicolas Sarkozy -- said it is clear that Turkey has made its membership.
According to the GMF survey, Turkey continues to reduce support for NATO.
Only 35% of the polls said NATO is essential for security, while this figure was 53% in 2004.
Analysts say that this is part of the main optimism between NATO member states and reflects the scandal and disappointment over the new role of security threats in public opinion.
The problems with the United States, which are operating in Iraq, have been linked to the problems with the PKK militants.
The majority of Turks believe they do not show interest.
Most of the European countries are charged with supporting the PKK.
The survey noted that there is a negative impact on Western political players in the region.
The positive concerns against neighbouring Iran have dropped from 43 per cent last year.
Turkish participants see "unprecedented" against Russia (21st) and China (28).

The Serbian government has responded to a new report claiming that the children and academics, who allegedly claims that Serbia is not worried in social health institutions, while Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica described the allegations as "poor".
"The charges against children are being used for the children, and that they are also worried that they are not the social institutions, but also for children," he said.
He added that a special commission will be established to prepare a report on the basic conditions for people who have special needs.
The International Criminal Tribunal for Index (MDRI), a US-based NGO, published a four-year working report on November 14th.
The study envisions the poor conditions in six institutions in Serbia, and the restaurants are seized.
The MDRI said that children have been linked to their families, they are forced to do their homes and they have to learn their homes, and they have not been punished.
"Other conditions are threatening to live in the Serbian institutions, lack of medicine, medical and insufficient insufficiency, and insufficient insufficient insufficiency," the report said. "The MDRI investigators are not allowed to cope their connections in some years and that they are not allowed to leave some years."
Although the government does not accept the problem, it says it is facing efforts to reform reforms in the framework of the weakness of social support and law enforcement.
"These are the most defendant citizens of Serbia.
Thousands of people who are closed to the institutions are defined and abuse of intelligence and intelligence.
"The dozens of children and cities are linked to their lives, and there is a dangerous and more dangerous fraud, and the European Conference for Human Rights is clear," he said.
"We are urging the Serbian government to stop this poor procedures and urge all obstacles to respect human rights," he said.
Kostunica, however, accused the MDRI of failing to initiate the MDRI campaign for a date for Kosovo status talks.
"The Serbian government will face this programme with all democratic and legal challenges," he added.
Meanwhile, Serbian Labour and Social Affairs Minister Rasim Ljajic said the report is a political image, but also criticised by criticism.
However, Ljajic said that the MDRI has suggested that the improvement of the conditions for obstacles is a precondition for Serbia &aposs EU accession talks.
"This report is not clear that the international media will be submitted to us and a press conference before submitted to state institutions," he said.
Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic is a report to "political stability".
"There is a person or organisations in the public, and that there is no problem that the country does not have an official representation with official institutions over the past four years, but this is not a stronger political will," Milosevic said.
Nevertheless, the government has promised to improve the situation of institutions that have special needs.
A action plan for preparing a bigger health strategy was adopted and is preparing a bill on protecting the rights of people who are protected.
The government has invested 12m euros to rebuild the hospitals' hospitals and plans to build new institutions.

Despite high figures, unemployment has already started to decrease more than 20%, officials say.
"The government will do everything from the government, and the measures will cause new jobs," Economy Minister Djuro Popac told local media.
President Ivo Josipovic is not optimistic.
Speaking at a recent meeting of representatives of business, Josipovic said the high unemployment rate "remains a positive problem" that the government does not have a results.

"I don ’ t think it is very good for them," he said.
Nevertheless, Sarkozy says the unification with the rest of Europe could lead to general unemployment.
"It is better that we can join the EU," Suzana said. "It will be easy to find a job.

The European Parliament (EP) Committee for Foreign Affairs agreed on Wednesday (January 27th) that Croatia could complete its EU accession talks by the end of June, but voiced concern about the country &aposs EU airport.
The document, drafted by the Croatian commissioner MEP Hannes Sports, was accepted by three opponents and was accepted by 62.
The document praised Croatia for its reform progress "in the field of reform", while changes in the constitution and judicial system are a example of example.
The document, however, stressed that Zagreb has made progress in co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), noting that the country has not been able to provide some key military documents from The Hague tribunal.

The trial was discovered during the executive era, which was declared after Djindjic murder.
Despite several arrests in the case, former Serbian Police Minister Dusan Mihajlovic says that the case is not resolved and that authorities are still aware of the criminal crime, and that no one can be financed.
The two leaders of the League and the Zemun Zemun were also a obstacle to the murder of Dusan Spasojevic and Mile Lukovic.
The two suspects are believed to have any details of the assassination.
Meanwhile, Djindjic and his lawyer, Rajko Danilovic, believes that the assassination was a major emphasis of the Milosevic secret police, crimes, democracy and co-operation with the UN tribunal in Serbia.

Do you say the Ahtisaari plan is detailed?
According to Robert Austin, a diplomat at at Toronto University, Martti Ahtisaari &aposs plan for the Kosovo plan, the plan has also been pushing for privatisation.
If the plan is meeting the details of the plan, Kosovo Albanians are very serious obligations to fulfil, the Kosovo Serbs could be able to win potential benefits.

Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari &aposs plan for Kosovo, while preparing the document is more than prepared.
Both countries and other countries in Kosovo are focusing on the preliminary details of the proposal, as well as the right to recognise Kosovo, and to recognise international agreements and recognise the right to become a member of international organisations.
The plan, meanwhile, will allow Ahtisaari to be removed, and this is not a lot of tasks that are important.
There is no idea that the citizens of the streets in northern Mitrovica will be "after independence".
The Ahtisaari plan aims to make Kosovo a multiethnic society before the plan, which is not recognised by Albanian communities.
In Kosovo, where more than 90 per cent of the population is created by Albanians, the Roma, Agriculture, Guri, Egypt, Turkish and Bosniak communities are very serious in all areas.
The plan envisions a biometric state.
The new Kosovo minority parties will play a critical role in the establishment of both government and government policies.
At the same time, Ahtisaari must not insist that the recommendations for communities are not revealed.
These recommendations were also expressed by the Kosovo Albanian side during direct talks in Vienna.
As the first step, Kosovo is to accept a constitution, which will contain many factors under Ahtisaari plan.
For that time, a total of 21 members of the Serb community must be formed to establish a total of 21 members, including smaller minorities.
The constitution should be held within nine months after the current parliament adopted by Kosovo.

The new electoral system also includes some major changes.
The parliament is still in 120 seats, with the unit.
The amendment is that the parties' agencies will be open -- so far, and many are not satisfied with this implementation.
The more than ten Serbian communities have been selected for a third seat for Albanian communities, including ten other communities.
These are the necessary conditions for the first two elections.
Every seats in the election are needed to win seats.
The new parliamentary rules include various rules on the basic majority.
Some amendments must be taken by the majority of the deputies representing small minorities in parliament and the parliament.
Everything is necessary for any specific changes.
A Serbian prime minister and another small minority will be represented in the new cabinet.
At the same time, it is also applied for national aid.
As the number of members of the cabinet is more than 12, a prime minister and a deputy prime minister will be expected.
Both of the deputies representing the small minorities in the future need to be acceptable for any amendment on the constitution.
The same legal system is being implemented for the justice system.
At least 15 per cent of judges in the Kosovo Constitutional Court have to be members of small minority communities.
Furthermore, national institutions have been granted broadcast officials in the local level.
Everything of official recognition of Kosovo (Albania and Serbs) have been detained in any of the right to education and national symbols and national symbols.
The mayor of the municipal Assembly, which has more than 10 per cent of the population, will be organised by a representative of small minorities.
As the Ohrid Framework Agreement, the ethnic institutions of Kosovo will reflect the level of public services.
However, local government is the most important.
This issue is the biggest obstacle for the Albanian majority, because Ahtisaari plan envisions a number of new municipal municipalities to establish a multilateral state structure and fulfil the demands of Serbs.
For instance, high education and health issues in northern Mitrovica are being removed to local government.
The same situation is also applied for other municipalities in the majority of Serbs.
Public schools in Serbian schools will be developed by the ministers in Serbia.
Although there is no major plan, the international community in Kosovo is ensuring serious presence.
As the plan is in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the International Civilian Corporation (UST), which is also a special representative of the EU.
UST 'authority is clear: the Ahtisaari plan will be a political centre in implementing the plan.
The UST has a difference between independence and unilateral declaration of independence.
The international community in Kosovo is expected to show serious presence in the near future. [UNMIK]
The Ahtisaari plan is doing more than an independent Kosovo.
Ahtisaari is submitted to a framework for the new phase of Kosovo &apos
Plan predicts that the situation in the region will be able to provide a solution for such a solution, as the requirements in the region have been realised.
So far, the task of the communities in Kosovo has proved to protect the multiethnic structures, under which the new and potential will be more difficult.
The Albanian majority, in order to be implemented by Ahtisaari &aposs visa-free status, has been sparked by the Albanian majority.
However, Albanian communities must use the effect of recognition and powers.
These communities have not been indicted in the Albanian community, if the Ahtisaari plan is successful and the use of authority.
The reaction signed by the plan is that both sides need to show more than the details of the plan -- because they have been said to have nothing to say, as it was said.
Currently, the Kosovo media has been focused on the outcome of a complete vote and the diplomatic force with Serbia and Russia.
However, there is many things that the move will be taken.
Meanwhile, the Serbian community in Kosovo has the opportunity to see Ahtisaari &aposs proposal to use its own interests.
Those who think that Kosovo will not be able to become a new Albanian state in the Balkans, but the plan would not be able to exercise.
In addition, a campaign that will be organised by Albanian officials in Kosovo, the public may be expected to be implemented.
The Albanian majority has been transferred to a number of comprehensive obligations that will not accept the plan and satisfy all.
Following that point, it is a society of information about the political will and process.

One of the problems, according to the OSCE, is that there is no witness protection mechanisms in Albania, and many victims are not willing to express.
The OSCE Integration and Human Rights Bureau is financing a Memorial Assistance Committee, which is operating in close co-operation with the IOM and public administration.
Since October 2002, women have been granted illegal immigration rules in their countries -- which have been sent to Albania -- have been sent to immigrants, according to the OSCE.

However, the country is still unable to create serious information on constitutional relations, foreign relations and security.
In addition, the law envisions that witnesses would allow the courts to be called for a mobile phone, narcotics or weapons to the state ammunition of witnesses in organised crime.
According to the new CCDK, prosecutors and judges can ask the DNA and the example of suspected suspects, but this will be necessary for the doctor.
Women and governments will be dismissed by women.

According to CCDK, critics are now being formed to establish a new penalty court, which is currently removed by the State Security Court.

The city administration, including Bosniaks, says it is the municipality of municipality.
Four police officers were injured.
The Islamic Community has asked Sandzak to speed up the process of autonomous autonomy, and called for "the regime and the regime" to convince civilian parties in the region ".

"The police [is] not to solve the religious and political problems, but it is the task of this post," Dacic said.
Ian Bancroft, the founder of the Transparency organisation, told SETimes that the Sandzak problem should be resolved with a compromise in the Bosniak community.
"Sandzak is a unique in the Balkans because it is not among the basic ethnic groups.
"The initiatives of Zukorlic and policy initiatives, such as the Bosniak national minority in the elections have been concrete in concrete concrete concrete management, are being threatened to stop stability in the region," he added.
"Zukorlic is trying to change the main political climate in the SDA and SDP 'sovereign sovereignty, while religious and symbolic' symbolises have shown a rhetoric and secure referendum," Zukorlic said.
"However, the situation does not demonstrate the money with Kosovo because Zukorlic is not supported by many Bosniaks and approach, and the Serbian government will not apply an official restriction, such as Zukorlic '," he said in Sandzak.

Serbia and Montenegro have signed an agreement to establish joint partners in the Montenegrin coastal coastal season, as a result of regional police co-operation, as well as to build organised crime.
"We want to show that co-operation between the two countries in the field of police," said Serbian Police Director Milorad Veljovic.
Montenegrin police spokesperson Radomir Radmanovic told SETimes that such a approach is necessary, which does not see free movement and borders.
"This is the creation of police staff, training and investigations for members of the two police officers," Radmanovic said.
Zeljko Likovic, owner of the Podgorica tourist centre, welcomed the co-operation of the police.
"Our judges are very important to feel that we feel in Montenegro.
I do not say that Montenegro is safe, but this move is crucial for the implementation of war crimes, "he said.
Liky Tours was reserved for more than 2,000 tourists from Serbia last year and Likovic expects the number of Serbian tourists this year.
Dragan Samarov, 43, told Belgrade that his family had a holiday holidays in Kotor, Montenegro, and now has no problem on security.
"In all years, I have said that there is no more flexibility of young people and more people.
This is not very important, "he said.
He said that some people have been convicted of weapons and the police have shown good fight against this problem.
"I do not see any reason that weapons have been shown as one of Montenegro for 20 years," he said.
Authorities say the agreement envisions long-term co-operation between Serbia and Montenegro police agencies.
He added that co-operation with other police agencies in the region is open.
The police co-operation in police is not a new reason for the Croatian police, which envisions Slovenia, Hungary, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic, the Czech Republic and Germany to implement the Security Sea project.

This group is visiting the border between the two countries.
At the same time, Kosovo police co-operate with Albanian police for two years, while several Kosovo Albanians are working to ensure the road for the summer season in Albania.
Banja Luka Security and Defence Affairs Director Predrag Ceranic told SETimes that the joint police work is a comprehensive co-operation with the police of the joint police requirements in the region, as the crimes are removing the police.
"They are co-operating with the opposition in neighbouring countries, so that police must co-operate in order to fight them.
This will become a traffic in the region and will be more difficult to operate in these conditions, "he said.
Veljovic proposed police forces to continue this traffic and facility.

Macedonia seeks accession dialogue with the EU
The EU will initiate a high-level dialogue to help Macedonia on the pace of institutional reforms, and to ensure that Greece will be able to move towards EU membership.

Macedonia and the EU will start high-level talks with the EU to complete the official negotiation process to start membership talks.
EC President Jose Manuel Barroso and Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule agreed in Ohrid last year to start talks with the Macedonian administration.
The goal of dialogue is to preserve the way of institutional reforms aimed at bringing Macedonia into the EU, the EU delegation said in a statement.
"The reason for the start of a dialogue with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski -- is the reason for the challenges in the reform process," EU spokesperson Konstantinski told SETimes.
During talks, Jovanovic said Macedonia will focus on reforms in public administration, strengthening the rule of law, strengthening freedom of expression, improving the election process and improving the market economy.
"Macedonia is now a high-ranking indictment and it is a step forward, despite the obstacle to Greece," Gruevski said.
Macedonia expects to start EU membership talks for 3 years.
Greece has blocked plans to be invited to join NATO in 2008, and has set EU membership due to a long-standing name dispute in 2009.
Greece says that "Macedonia" does not mean the threat to the same area of Macedonia.
Macedonia, adopted by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia "under the UN", says it would mean the change of national identity. More than 100 countries recognise the Republic of Macedonia as "Macedonia".
As part of the dialogue, EU and Macedonian leaders will meet in two years, but dialogue will continue for years.
In October, a progress report will be released.
"It will encourage the establishment of similar mechanisms to be established in other parts of this dialogue," political Studies Centre analyst Vladimir Bozinovski told SETimes.
According to Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Teuta Arifi, the high-level dialogue will not be able to launch official membership talks.
"The dialogue is a cautioning that the EU has made it clear that our activities have made since the latest EC progress report," Arifi said.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, however, said the ICJ decision on Macedonia and the Macedonian interim agreement envisions a framework for Macedonia to continue its EU accession process.
Ivanov also reflected this stance with top EU officials -- Richard Owitzerland, Elenard Kukan, Lojania -- during a meeting last month.
"This process should continue as a parallel in talks with Greece to find a solution to the name dispute," Ivanov Foreign Minister Darko Kosinovic told SETimes.
Some analysts say the dialogue will facilitate the current regional disputes and facilitate candidates for EU membership.
"In 1981, the European Parliament decided on Greece 'EU membership, but the country was accepted because of political pressure," he said.
The other regional countries that aim to join the EU are not announced, but analysts say bilateral disputes will be a problem in the process.
Belgrade and Pristina reached an agreement last month on the regional representation of Belgrade and Kosovo, but Brussels responded to a very positive response to Serbia, which has granted EU membership candidate.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will apply to EU membership in July.
The problems facing BiH are also on reforms and relations with Serbia and Croatia on the position of Croats in Republika Srpska and BiH.

Following the Chinese market, the VANI has won the Chinese market last year, following a "feature" initiative to send 250,000 jobs.
"The most important resources are to find and do it.
So far, it must be done in the right direction, "he said.

"There is no gas of Xinhua and this is a major potential potential," he added, adding that Greek food producers should be more easy if they want to enter other markets.
He said the company is in line with the Hint market.
A dozen VAEI car plans to export other Greek products, including a 2 euros in China.
Since the 2004 Olympic Games, China has shown great interest in traditional Greek products.
During his latest official visit to Greece, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jionao pledged to ratify Greek Cypriots.
Wen Domir Tossis screened a car and opened the closure of Greek exports.
Following that, donor Yiannis Tokys, the owner of Domalos, signed a 80m-euro agreement and sent a 45m-euro loan to Asia in 2011.
Meanwhile, Mihalis Bouis, another Greek wrestling producer, was in Czech, and the local producer Moodo has established the Governor Valley Window Windoy, in the northwest of China.
At the same time, Greek borders are very important.
"Everything is supporting the Greek power plant, especially for China," Presidency Chairman Valley Boukis told SETimes.
"Our visa-free visa-free travel is to ensure that other Greek products are expected, to open the way and to ensure that Chinese consumers will benefit Greek consumers," Boukis added.
Following a new reunification system in early 1980, the EU has sparked higher standards, increasing the quality of Greek farmers' liquidity, and has caused to help international markets.
According to a 2011 report by Dimitris Thomopoulos, a Greek Economic and Commercial Affairs Agency for Economic and Trade in Beijing, China has made the greatest increase in imports in the past 30%, due to a decline in the sale of sale and medicine status.

The Serbian female (RSD) has reached a low level of history.
In 2002, the German bronze was a 6.63 euros. On March 12th, the foreign currency board was led by the RSD.
He has been weakened over the past 10 years, but the number of concerns have increased in recent years.
The RSD continues to weakened by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) interventions through foreign reserves, but the last two months continued to weaken.
This year, the bank said, it has caused the rise in the weakness of energy imports.
The amendments to the article have caused more effects on the local economy, which has been on exports or imports.
The move has been helped to export companies, while imports are caused.
Among more than 30 countries, Mile Draganic, director of a company of military and police services, and owner of the United States, said it is rising the risk of imports from the weakness.
"Public organisations are not able to find any possibilities, but only on the city.
"Our example is that we have frozen more than six months ago, and we have been able to have full inflation in the inflation situation, so we cannot meet a real revenue," he said.
Draganic, who worked more than 350 workers, is also concerned about the influence of the foreign currency board, which has dropped the weakness of weakness.
Slobodan Aleksic, 56, is a good example.
"It is difficult to solve the soldiers, because I am the only people who have a strong job in the family.
The initiative is working in a small private company, which has been working on the factory.
We have already received a loan from the euro and a car.
However, this is not a visa liberalisation, "he said.
The NBS is trying to promote the use of other money laundering, to prevent serious results in the scandal.
Dejan Jovovic, an adviser to the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, said the measure that the local currency units can be reduced to reducing the risk of interest.
"If the rise is increasingly reduced, the loans have been reduced, money laundering, the rising risk of money is reduced, which caused to strengthen this [diplomatic]," Jovovic told SETimes.

The European Commission (EC) report on Monday (September 20th) voiced hope that Romania 'hopes to recognise the country as a key requirement to complete its accession talks with the Union, one of the key requirements needed to complete its accession talks with the Union.
"We hope that Romania will be accepted as an external market economy, which will have the capacity of full co-operation in the EU [EU] requirements, if the reforms are made," Puscas said in a press release on October 6th.
Romania is seeking to complete its accession talks with Brussels by the end of this year, and wants to complete its accession talks with Bulgaria by the end of this year.
Nevertheless, the EC head of Romania, Jonato Scheder, said in a press release Monday that the market economy, which is one of the two economic criteria for membership, would focus on status.
He added that the second water criteria -- the capacity of competitiveness and market forces in the Union -- will be needed until 2007.

Free prices and competitiveness are crucial for the right of the resources. [SE Times] Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu emphasised the importance of improving good institutions and functioning public administration and institutional management.
According to Daianu, these factors are the general performance of the economy.

Free market and competitiveness are crucial for the right of resources.
The initiative must be recognised as a clear and protecting the rights of property and commercial activities. The budget restrictions should be implemented in both areas, as well as to ensure stability. The current budget deficit must be implemented in the long term, as well as smaller budget deficits, the money is a negative consequence of financial stability.
At the same time, however, the physical and nature is an obstacle to the formal policy that must be able to serve in certain interests.
At the beginning of the year, the economies are still unable to reach a compromise on certain issues of discussions.
This uncertainty could seek a more open debate between policies and government advisers.
Among these issues: the situation of the countries that have developed.
The Free trade is a reasonable assessment of many economists, but there is a wide-range biometric and intelligence effects to protect some of the countries that are developing.
The free trade, such as Denmark Rodrik, does not lead to economic growth.
As a result of a result of trade talks in Canadian, the difference between the rich countries is not known as the issue of agriculture consumption.
Free free movement is very dangerous for developing markets.
Although the IMF has been implemented ten years ago, the institutional and provisions are not in accordance with the current account deficit.
With the restructuring of the political co-ordination, the public is expected to be considered a precondition for intervention in the economy.
Many financial crisis and financial crisis, as well as energy trade, are forced to prevent serious diseases in the functioning of the markets, organisations and legal arrangements in the functioning of energy, and the provisions "broadcast" provisions "by the state of markets.
The government will not have a role in the austerity of public goods.
They also suggested that the government is part of the role of its role in social and technological development.
A series of defence programmes in the EU 'Eurozone programme and a number of defence programmes in the United States can be described as an example of social policies.
The fiscal policy could be a true in the world if it is frozen with a major biometric passports.
Many economically and developed economies are being used to achieve national economic targets, which can be used to increase the bill.
Do you responsible for the production of public goods in the World economy?
What is the responsibility and responsibility for this issue, including the co-ordination of different policies in the world economy, including co-ordination of diversity policies.
Economists, meanwhile, have emphasised the importance of resources and initiative award, while other governments continue to discuss economic role.
This controversial controversial, Robert Gospin, won the New Year of New Year: for example, for example, it is the possibility of a sovereignty of the poorest economy. "It 'a huge balance of weaknesses [that] reflected to be] the
New Year Teachers, who are on the former development economies, are sparking good economies.
Albert Hurriyet, Paul Ragnin, Ragnen Nury, Gunden Municipal, Haradinaj and many economists emphasised the role of institutions, poverty institutions, poor countries and in various areas.
A "Great" need to be a "Grand", as Romania is recognised by the 1943 history.
In a controversial debate over the development economy, many former issues are discovered.
In this conclusion, the foreign policy of both public policies have emphasised the issues such as "some developments", such as pyramids, donations, return and "at least developments".
Both the national level of international policies are clear that the governments are successful, as well as the success of the market co-ordination.
In this context, public administration and institutional governance must undermine the reality of the economy, which is in accordance with functioning institutions and implementation.
The major differences on the economic performance of the communist countries in the transition are facing different jobs in institutional structures and policies.
As many of the countries in China and India are developed in the economic progress of many areas, we are pushing for a new development of the development of a new development economy, when the communist countries' successful transition and "control" in many of the communist countries.
Authorities, such as Alexandroud, Paul Krugman, Denmark Rodrik and Joseph Smagazz, can successfully make more realistic and credibility in the development of policies.

Macedonians are preparing to go to the June 1st elections, after the first condemned and disappointment of the invitation for NATO membership.
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has decided to accept the early election proposal by the Democratic Union of Albanians (DUI).
Gruevski said he hopes a new mandate and a more stable parliamentary assembly, and hopes to resolve problems that many say it will increase.
However, these movements have been criticised. But the elections will face a meeting on the name dispute with Greece.
The dispute could not block its invitation to join the NATO summit in Bucharest, but could affect the start of EU accession talks.
During the summit in Bucharest, NATO leaders agreed that Athens and Skopje could decide whether Macedonia is ready to invite the embassy before the next summit is expected.
Crvenkovski and President Branko Crvenkovski, who met with US Ambassador to NATO Victor Nuland, said the name dispute should be resolved within weeks or weeks ".
Nuland is still on the agenda of NATO, while Skopje wants to work to ensure a compromise ".
The opposition Social Democrats, however, accused Gruevski 'ideas as and accused him of failing to turn into a political warrant.
Speaking to members of the law, Crvenkovski voiced hope that he and voiced hope that the international mediator Matthew Nimetz, which is expected to accept a compromise with Greece -- is ready to accept the name of the Republic of Macedonia (Republic) -- the latest offer of international mediator Matthew Nimetz.

However, it will be difficult to fulfil the conditions until September, if the EC is due to submit its report.
A new government board will be established by the summer.
Meanwhile, the motion of parliament is restricting bilateral opportunities with Greece.
The government is now technically seeking to stop and important decisions.
Washington argues that Macedonia is strong in its partnership, but the United States could be able to give up the Balkans as the approach of the presidential elections.
NATO membership is not only a major milestone, but also a major factor for Macedonia 'stability. The Ohrid Agreement, signed in 2001, is still needed to work on ethnic democracy in the country, although it was signed by the Ohrid Agreement in 2001.
The institutions have a negative impact on the Macedonian economy, which is weakening and membership.
In the country, the trade deficit is 113m euros, and unemployment rate is 35 per cent.
We need more foreign investments to resolve these problems, but the union of the Bucharest summit does not have a better environment for investors.
Economic details and institutional problems could cause the restructuring of nationalists, especially after Kosovo declared independence.

Some British lawmakers warn that Turkey will have serious security risks. [Reuters]
Turkey must strengthen border crossings to join the EU, and the country will have a variety of risks for EU security, a group of British lawmakers said in a report released on Monday (August 1st).
Turkey began its accession talks with the EU in October 2005, but many EU member states are facing various reasons.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule, who is preparing the report, said members of the majority Muslim community, are not expected to join the bloc by 2020.
If the EU members and Greece join the northern border with Bulgaria and the south, Turkey will be based on foreign borders with Syria, Syria, Iraq, Iraq and Iran.
The countries' support for Turkey 'EU membership, the British lawmakers described the border with Turkey as "the main point of illegal immigrants" for the Union.
"In October 2010, 46 per cent of the national immigrants that were injured in the EU [external borders] with Greece, and authorities say they are trying to lift the border with about 12.5km north of Greece, near Opanon," the report said.
A group of experts from Athens' request came to the region in November to help Greece over the number of illegal immigrants from Turkey.
More than 4.5 per cent of the number of illegal migrants have been increased in five months -- 7.67 in October 2010, and in February 2011, the figure is believed to be the effect of economic development in Europe.
The committee also suggested that the institution has proposed changes to the operations, and praised Turkish border officers to create a working environmental environment in co-operation with the Turkish border agencies, while praising the efforts of illegal immigrants.
"Greece and Turkey have shown a joint decision on this issue, as well as the European and international security agencies, and they need to share intelligence organisations and work together to convince the EU to send thousands of illegal immigrants," said Kez Vazz, head of the Socialist Party and committee.
Turkish drugs say the 27-nation bloc is a serious threat for the security of the 27-nation bloc, adding that more than 80 per cent of Afghanistan from Western and Central Europe.
According to the EU police service, South Stream is increasingly increasing in recent years, with the amount of discovered by Turkey and the Balkans.
MP lawmakers said that the amount of discovered by Turkish officials has increased in the past few years, but the amount of the amount of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of detainees from the Environmental Protection.
MPs also voiced concern about human trafficking activities, including local criminal groups to Turkey, or the country.
According to the committee, "The EU must hold a protocol to fight organised crime and illegal immigration, Turkey must implement some member states before joining the Union."
At the same time, the new Turkish Assembly said that the new Turkish Assembly should take effective law on a more high-level co-operation between the country officials and Media.

Ivo Ivanovic is a member of the ruling GERB party in Bulgaria, and a European Parliament (EP).
In December 2009, Ivanova launched an initiative to remove Bulgarian workers' restrictions to block business restrictions in the 10 EU member states.
The initiative won a strong supporter earlier this month: Bulgarian football star Hristo Stojkov.
SETimes correspondent Ivanovic about the initiative.
SETimes: What progress has been made since the start of the campaign?
In April 2010, I proposed a delegation to meet EU lawmakers' recommendations on the economic crisis.
In Meta, the free movement of enlargement and business restrictions are on positive effects on improving the functioning market.
The EP 'Committee on Sunday and the Committee of Committee for Commerce approved a blueprint that urges all EU member states to monitor restrictions.
Following a meeting with Bulgarian Parliament Speaker Todorska Tuzla on ways to boost the effect of our initiative, Bulgarian Parliament Speaker Todorska sent to visitors in ten European countries -- Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Italy, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Netherlands and Britain.
I also met with the ambassadors and EP colleagues.
SETimes: How do you expect the work of Bulgarian and Romanian workers to be removed by 2012?
Ivanova: I believe that I believe that this is good.
On June 18th, the EC launched a public research on discrimination against people in some EU member states, as well as some EU member states.
The survey can be focused on all EU members and the internet until August 12th.
The EC aims to promote the situation and implement the framework of free movement and workers.
Another reason for optimism is that I have sent to the EC to the second writer.
Laslo Andor, a member of the commissioner for the work, said the second transition period of transition (2011) would ask the second transition period to restrict restrictions from member states who want to remove this two years.
SETimes: How do you think about the conditions for the EU colleagues, people and Bulgaria to the EU market?
Ivanovic: Bana supports full support.
In addition, the EP lawmakers see the values of unique markets, as well as the free movement of human trafficking.
The Dutch EP member Marije Djordjevic was surprised by the Marije Corners.
He opposes restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian workers, and organised a television debate on the opening of the market.
SETimes: How do you see the idea of Hristo Stojkov to participate in the campaign?
Ivanovic: We agreed that this is a situation that Stojkov can affect its popularity, decisions and professionalism 'success and can affect the campaign.
The campaign, such as Stojkov, shows that workers in the new EU member states can contribute to the joint EU market.
SETimes: How do you plan special initiatives, such as Stojkov, as the EU member states are planning to open their markets?
Ivanova: We will hold a meeting of Romanian colleagues in the EP with our Romanian colleagues.
"We want to try to invest in the campaign, including Stojkov.
A loan in BiH awaits difficult days
The retail films are responsible in the situation and some are facing an unprecedented outcome.

The movies, friends and families, are at the end of the time when the films are not able to pay their debt.
According to the BiH Association of Protection, 19 screened in the past three years
"The barriers have signed a contract to assist their debt, but there is no institutional protection," Association President Jovica Djvkovic told SETimes.
Cvjkovic said that many people have been helped to help their family, friends, friends and witnesses, but many people were injured by trying to help us.
According to data, there are about 200,000 complaints, including widespread or explosives.
In a country, such as BiH faces a smaller economic crisis, it could become a member of the group.
Discussions on the barricades were the privatisation of the banking sector in 2002 and with foreign banks in BiH.
The loan expansion of the public 'national debt continues to give the global economic crisis in 2008.
"The banks are applied, and they can be able to show that they are active with the debt," Economist Sinisa Bozic told SETimes.
The banks want to represent the debt as soon as possible, and they are aware that this can be more active, as they are accused of accusing the movements to the debt, "he said.
He argues that the debt is created a system that allows more banks and biometric loan organisations to provide loan from loans.
"Therefore, the BiH central bank was not a owner of the Borcic Capital (MBK), and that people will not be able to pay their debt, but they have started to restore the films that some debt could not be spent as soon as possible," he said.
The Association has requested a legal solution for both sides and the BiH level, but the public has organised a campaign on the issue.
According to Cvjetkovic, the aim of the campaign is to promote the movies of the campaign, to defend changes in the law and to punish the professional profits.
The Republika Srpska Finance Ministry has already prepared a law to protect the films.
He hopes that the law enforcement and obligations with the banks would allow people to cope with the sovereignty of external debt.
The BiH Bank, however, claims that this issue has been focused on the basis of the Constitution and advising the rights of the films in the court.
Everything that accepts the tender is acceptable to the obligations of the main debt, the agency said, adding that all problems should be discussed by the courts.
The agency said some changes have started to find a solution to the system.
Since January, the agency has been facing a new loan of loans.
Nevertheless, these hundreds of loans are under problems.
"The law will not be really realistic, because it will not be able to rescue changes that will rescue their obligations, it will be able to implement the bankruptcy in the banks if the bridge is completely completely completed or paying the debt.
However, all optimistic options about the debt will be the beginning of the films, "he said.

According to media reports, the military army has reportedly requested early pension to protest that more than 250 officers are currently under control of the committee in the government.

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared the Commander of the General Staff, General Necdet Ozgur, the new general staff.
In addition, the chief of the general staff was commander of the forces.
According to analysts, the resignation shows that the civilian administration is increasingly increasingly concerned over the military.
Everything is in accordance with the procedure, the leader of the AKP, Sadih Kususek, said, stressing that the resignations were not affected by the army or functioning.
"Turkey is implementing the procedures for democracy and laws," he told SETimes, calling the resignation "not more than a early pension".
"The resignation has accepted the real reasons for the resignation," he said, adding that "a third entity," even even even even if it is an independent investigations. "
However, it has been criticised by several people, due to the investigation into the fourth couple, political development and arrest of suspected suspects.
"It is not a matter of investigations," said Arim Hamzai, head of the CHP parliamentary group. "We are under control of the government."
"The government wants to resign in accordance with its own stages," he told SETimes.
Omar Vuranic, head of the MHP leader and parliamentary group, says the investigation was used to use the army 'image as the most respective institutions.
"There are concerns that the investigations against the government are concerned that the army is aimed at removing the army and simply," Vural told SETimes.
On the other hand, he says, the Central Asia Studies Institute and the Special Studies Programme has resigned to resign or send secret threats.
"This is clear," he told SETimes. "The new Chief of General Staff General Necdet Ozel is a new commander.
So far, there is a good opportunity for relations between civilian authorities and the army. "
"In the long term, I expect the government to take steps to strengthen the position of General Special Ozel, in the army," he added.
The new Kemal Kemal Kemal, the Turkish defence analyst and Security Policy Institute, believes the recent developments have shown a fight between Islamic groups.
"The crisis has been resolved as the chief of the general staff of Necdet Ozel is resolved.
However, we have to expect new consequences in the crisis between civilian doctors and military environmental resources in the coming days. "

The Serbian parliament met on Sunday (July 30th) and adopted a draft resolution on the crisis in the north of Kosovo.
The government of Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has condemned the actions as a threat to "possible peace, stability and compromise solution".
The lawmakers demanded that the international community wants Pristina to stop such action.
They called for dialogue to reach a peaceful solution and reconciliation.

According to local media reports, KFOR resigned at the Brnjak and Local border crossings, but the situation is protecting tensions, and local Serbs continue to build barricades in some areas.
Although Belgrade opposes the initiative to restore the authority of Pristina, some political commentators say the Serbian government is not optimistic.
Zarko Markovic argues the current situation is a key restrictions.
"We are closely closed to the Kosovo government to establish the state functioning of all border crossings, and we have returned to the previous situation," Markovic told SETimes.
He added that the Serbian authorities have made a solution that will not show their own in the parliamentary elections next year.
According to analyst Dusan Janjic, Belgrade has chosen its responsibility to the international community and accusing KFOR and NATO.
Janjic told SETimes that he could "open new conflicts with these organisations that should be able to resolve the crisis".
"It is dangerous for the consultations of parliament," he said.
Serbian President Boris Tadic accused some of using the enlargement process to pressure on Serbia on Kosovo.
"There is no better aspect of dialogue, but Serbia will not accept any changes in northern Kosovo and Metohija on the European integration of Kosovo," Tadic told the B92 media.
Tadic said that Serbia will be [nothing] if the recognition of Kosovo [independence] is a condition for membership.
In Serbian public, there are different opinions that should be done.
"I do not want the government to send our European future because the Kosovo Albanians do not want Serbia for more than ten years and that Kosovo Albanians do not want to live in Serbia," Belgrade-based Ivora Krajljanac, 38, told SETimes.
The EU said it was sent to Robert Cooper to resolve the border crisis.
Meanwhile, two representatives of the Serbian government, Borko Stefanovic and Goran Bogdanovic arrived in northern Kosovo to discuss the Serb community.

Reforms of discrimination in Serbia under the auspices of Egyptian Protection
The action against violence over the past decades is not different, especially for women and minorities, he said.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 25 / 04 / 11
Serbian Affairs Commissioner Nevena Petrusic. [EU]
Serbian Affairs Commissioner Nevena Petrusic, who has been serving for nearly a decade, faces problems such as opponents.
In this exclusive interview with SETimes correspondent Igor Jovanovic, former head of the Nis Law Foundation, Petrusic, told SETimes that discrimination is a lot of discrimination in the society and that people will not be easy to change it.
SETimes: If the Women have 51 per cent of the population, the same employees are less widespread, and the law enforcement has a lower turnout in the judiciary and judiciary.
How do you consider the reality of the Serb community?
Nevena Petrusic: While women and men in Serbia have a equal rights, women are also undermining a direct discrimination, incidents and intellectual discrimination, and the basic reason is the basic reason for women and their responsibility for their society and their responsibility.
According to researchers, women -- especially from ethnic minorities and minority groups, Roma, refugees, poverty, poverty, discrimination, discrimination, sexual sexual sexual immunity, and there is a difficult position in the field of social life.
Public employees say that the employees are less than 16 per cent. [Reuters]
The data shows that women have not participated in the process of determining the state. Only 21.2 per cent of Serbian lawmakers, 21.3 per cent of the municipalities, and 18.5 per cent of the ministers.
Over 4 per cent of the municipalities.
The discrimination against women also shows that economic data.
The unemployment rate in Women is higher than two times.
The salaries between women and men are 16 per cent.
Women, society and the economy are taking over 30.5 per cent, and they are in administrative management.
The economic unemployment rate, a result of the youth discrimination, is high.
As for education, women are still a weak position.
Even if the community must say, there is no unemployment between women and men and men, but some minority groups, especially in some minority groups, including insufficient insufficient insufficient unemployment.
The high level of education is increasingly increasingly increasing the level of participation in young women, and the number of student students is rising at the level of public level.
Another violence against humanity, women, human trafficking and human trafficking are sceptical.
Special research by NGOs, as the people are not recognised by the state level of violence is not recognised.
Furthermore, women are concerned about the remaining groups of discrimination and discrimination.
The current mechanisms that protect violence against humanitarian violence are not implemented, and there is no protocol on the tasks of the police, but also a lot of co-operation between institutions and institutions to address the issue.
Roma women are "the most dangerous part of the population", Petrusic told SETimes. [Reuters]
Women in the court process of violence are sparked to a second protocol in women, and they are not able to support enough social and social assistance.
Roma women are also used to protect human rights, especially in the removal of security and women 'asylum seekers, as well as discrimination.
SETimes: What is the special social programmes for Roma participation in society?
Petrovic: The average life of Roma women is really really proved that the average life is 48 years.
The situation of Roma women in Serbia cannot be improved without sufficient measures.
The measures aimed at improving the situation of the Roma population should also be developed in special measures for Roma women, which are both women and the Roma community, as they are in the Roma community.
Roma women are crucial to ensure more education and employment, because the judges are now usually usually usually usually usually usually used to restrict in the level of restrictions due to ethnic and human rights.
SETimes: How has been announced since the opening of the Service?
Do you think that the citizens are in accordance with the implementation of discrimination?
Petrovic: We are in a country where the rhetoric is widely broadcast in both public and public sectors, and in the private field, the risk of women, women, sexual sovereignty, sexual discrimination and discrimination.
Therefore, we are seeking to create a democratic, open and tolerance society, open and tolerance, and we are facing challenges to combat discrimination.
It was only the first step towards the fight against corruption. The second step should be implemented.
The Protection Commission has been more than 200 details of the Protection Commission. Among the women have been women and more than 20 details of NGOs.
People are the most complicated in the field of intelligence and intelligence, and this discrimination is not in the scandal of ethnic identity and a certain political party.
At the same time, we also received six details on the rhetoric rhetoric for people of the sexual minorities.
Our citizens do not know that the discrimination is not completely completely, and this is nothing that they think it is not in accordance with them, and that some judges are injured.
Therefore, there is many things that people are training and that they can be able to protect them, and we have to do so that they can be able to ensure that they can be protected.
SETimes: How do you think we have enough interest in the implementation of sanctions for violations of the law?
Petrusic: A good legal framework for discrimination in Serbia and this legal framework is meant to protect the presence of the legal framework, punishment and churches as part of the law.
I think that the task of the Affairs Commissioner for Protection is widely widely designed to tackle any discrimination.
In a part of the border, concrete discrimination cases are doing to take action.
However, the commission is part of the law on the principles of the Membership, and the commissioner can ask the case and ask them to protect the discrimination.
"I want to emphasise the authority of the commission to propose a mediator in discrimination cases.
He cited that the actions of discrimination have created the responsibility of the actions of the academic structures and how it is unacceptable.
I think this is the best mechanism to prevent discrimination.

A Orthodox church is part of a Orthodox church in the eastern Bosnian town of Zvornik, near Zvornik.
The local administration has been repeatedly undermining ethnic relations, but it is said to be a symbolic of reconciliation challenges in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Following the BiH conflict, Muslims demanded the removal of the armed church and reconstruction of the mosque in the first phase of the mosque, while local authorities are willing to find another chance for the mosque.
The local governance has spent 30,000 euros, and the human rights commissioner in BiH received a request for the new mosque of the Zvornik municipality.
Zvornik police officer Dragan Judic said he has already offered two bids, but the Islamic community refused to reject both.
The situation has caused Muslims' protests and the discovery of the churches.
One of the protesters, Beqa Eftic, said he is not reminded, but added that the Muslims would be better.
During his death, Divic returned to Serb refugees from other parts of BiH.
Sint Stefan, one of the most popular Serbs, was changed.
However, there is only a Serb living in the village.
Risto Cretic argues that the pension and neighbours are not good.
Following the attack, the aircraft had to intervene on police intervention.
The tensions on the Cami problem are also seen as the poor economic situation in the region.
Most of the 185 families in Divic have the diplomacy, but only a few members have been consistent.
The people say they are aware of aid and smaller pensions.
Serbia faces sale of power plants
Furthermore, there is no money to fulfil the standards or new factories, while Serbia is a need for restructuring the power sector.
However, any move to privatisation of the state power utility will likely face the opposition.
By Georgi Mitev-Shanden for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 27 / 02 / 06
The EPS must invest 1 billion euros in investing in order to fulfil the European smuggling standards. [EPS]
The Serbian government does not face challenges.
Following pressure from the IMF last week to open the privatisation adviser to the Serbian Petroleum (NI), the government announced that Serbia "strategic advisory" for Industry (EPS), the government announced that it would be able to elect a "strategic advisory".
The move is the sale of the company 'privatisation and refineries.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, the consortium will need to "create a consortium for restructuring and development of the company" and to prevent the best privatisation model ".
A total of 50m loan from the World Bank will open this tender for the reconstruction of the tender, the future of EPS and the public will pay for electricity.
The primary prices of electricity will be one of the lowest prices in the region, though the price of electricity is potential.
EPS is very clear that everything should be done.
The company must invest 1 billion euros to fulfil European standards, but there is no money for this.
Today, Serbia could meet most of its power utility, but it will need a biometric power plant and a hydropower plant in five years, and the costs are changed between 750m euros and 750m euros.
The government does not choose the prices to meet the costs of EPS, due to the control of electricity prices.
Indeed, electricity prices are "the Socialist" level "in Serbia.
The EPS has allocated at least 80m euros for electricity imports every year, but it is selling a third of the price of electricity prices.
The World Bank supports efforts to restructuring the energy market, but says it should not be able to stay.
David Kenny, a senior economist of the Bank, says the Bank does not want the privatisation tender for EPS, adding that any privatisation plan should be prepared.
The government has been welcomed by the first steps in this direction and the EPS administration.
They are also charged with charges that about 40,000 people are working and that the company will be part of the company.
The best hydropower plants and mobile power plants, as well as the electricity distribution companies, which are paying taxes, will be sold.
Experts, meanwhile, argue that the system can affect the efficiency of the system, and some argue that the systems can provide a safety of electricity.
In other countries in Eastern Europe, the Czech, Hungarians and Policy are also a attempt to improve their systems.
The situation is not different in Bulgaria, where the Czech company, the potential for electricity distribution companies and power distributors, is being implemented.

Most of the former Soviet states in the Balkans have made some progress in democratic development over the past ten years, the Freedom House said in a new study released on June 29th.
"For the census, about 80% of the people who live in the former Soviet Union -- 2221m euros -- are still in front of the basic political rights," the US-based monitoring organisation said in its annual report.
The report cites Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Macedonia over the past decade, as well as "a" serious progress "in other areas, as well as" some progress ".
The study assesses democratic governments in 2009, with the basic development of 29 countries from Central Europe to Austria.
These include the election process, civil society, independent media, national and local government, independence and corruption.
Three groups are divided: the new EU states, including Bulgaria and Romania, are the former Soviet states and Albania, BiH, BiH, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
One of the countries' highest democratic development is the largest general democracy rating from 1 to 7 to 7.
It represents the average salary of the scores of scores in each country.
In 2009, only five countries -- Belarus, Kosovo, Lithuania, Macedonia, Macedonia and Serbia -- have been increasingly increasing their total democracy rating, while Albania, BiH, BiH, Romania, ranked 14 other countries' report by the previous year.
"The former Soviet Union and the countries in the Middle East have declined in democratic institutions," Freedom House said in a statement.
The survey was only one of the countries' countries' countries -- EU membership -- the symbolic symbolic, accepted by "local democracies".
The Freedom House said Romania faces "sovereignty and other institutional challenges" in the report this year, with 3.6 points to 3.6 points from Bulgaria and the previous report.
Croatia and Serbia, which ranked 3.71 points, are among the groups of Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, which ranked 3.79 points this year.
BiH has increased its overall democracy rating from 5.17 in 2001 to 404 in 2007.
The rise in political climate over the past decades was a slowdown in the new report with 4.25.
According to that, BiH has been removed as a "transition government or unacceptable regime" with Ukraine and Georgia, which ranked 4.99.
Freedom House, noting that Kosovo has made significant improvements in 2009, has repeatedly rejected the "radical regime" between Moldova and Armenia, with 5.99% of its overall democracy, with Moldova and Armenia.
"If the EU continues to be a clear strategy against Serbia, BiH could become a slowly part of a slow part of the region, a slowdown transformation of isolation, isolation and economic discrimination," the organisation warned.

After more than two years of independence, Serbian leaders say that the negotiating chapter could be taken on the agenda.
Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic is confident that the independence of the International Court of Justice would be disappointed by the international law.
Authorities say the outcome could open a new status talks and a compromise for Belgrade.
"One of the scenarios will have to give up one, and it will insist Kosovo," said Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo Aleksandar Ivanovic.
Many Kosovo Serbs, however, have been pushing.
According to High Representative Rice Trajkovic, Belgrade does not have the political event to find a solution.
"Serbia is not a clear strategy for political and security, and there is no clear strategy for economic donations and to Kosovo and Metohija," Trajkovic told SETimes. "Even if all weaknesses can start talks on the status talks, there is no success."
The technical talks on the issues affecting Kosovo Serbs, he said.
"If these negotiations are prepared, the Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church can strengthen the position in Kosovo," he said.
Trajkovic also urged Serbia to leave any negotiation chapter.
According to him, the pro-ethnic Albanian groups in Macedonia have started reunification, and Belgrade could cause a new step towards any new conflicts.
Meanwhile, nationalist nationalists are opposed to the Belgrade talks -- that the Serbs in Kosovo -- will mean to recognise independence, which can improve the conditions of Serbs in Kosovo.
"Technological talks are a sign for Serbia," Kosovo and Metohija Chairman Marko Jaksic told SETimes. "We will not improve our life, because we do not oppose the independence of Kosovo."

Social Affairs Minister Rasim Ljajic opposes the country 'policy in Kosovo.
"Serbia has invested 500m euros in Kosovo, but I am not confident that this money is the best way," Ljajic said.
Analysts say the talks will continue, if Serbia is likely to continue with different organisations on its territory of northern Kosovo and Serbian monasteries, which would allow Belgrade to allow parallel relations.
"The North Iraq is a good example of all solutions proposed by former UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari 'plan," said Predrag Simic, the former Serbian Paris ambassador and international law professor.
While acknowledging that Serbia has rejected the Ahtisaari plan, Simic noted that the 124-strong UN Constitution and the Kumanovo Agreement was unacceptable to accept a point.
Political analyst Dusan Janjic told SETimes that the possibility of the independence of Kosovo is low.
"The crisis of Belgrade is the key to start talks with Brussels on the status of the crisis.
This is the end of an agreement on Serbia on its path to the EU, "he said.

Croatia ’ s huge energy investment
In Croatia, nine and smaller energy sources are important, but they are not used.
By Ksenija Jurkovic for Southeast European Times – 16 / 03 / 11
Business and gass are the main renewable energy resources of Croatia. [Reuters]
Croatia has a broad potential for renewable resources, but at least nine days, it is still used to use this potential.
However, this is changed in recent years.
"We are now producing 40% of our energy.
If we have to buy about 30% of our energy, we are very worse, "he said.
The "new renewable" resources are being implemented among private investors, especially in the field of use of energy.
The first wind power plant in Croatia was established in Padg in 2004.
The company, Adria Wind Power, has established 5950MW capacity in the Rava region.
The biggest participation in the development of the wind power power plant was in the coastal area of Sibia, especially in the German Energy company, which has invested two new plants.
The first plant in 2006 was established in the Trav-Kemal reactions, with the second in the Orthodox last year.
While in Croatia, hundreds of regional initiatives have been removed, most of them are part of the Dalmatia region.
The five energy supplies are a different factor, despite a broad potential.
In Croatia, about 15,000 cubic metres are operating, according to a database from the Industry Institute for Hrrvoje Paksic Energy.
A total of 52m cubic metres are estimated this day.
"In Croatia, there is no financial support for the use of narcotics of narcotics in the southern energy, and this is being removed to the jobs," Vjeran Piric, head of the Association of E-King Association, told SETimes.
Piric said that various energy users, including wind energy defendants, have blocked more developments in the southern alternative.
"Everything was given to all renewal of the renewal of the renewable energy," Piric said. "The wind energy is a bad choice for our country, especially in the south."
At the economy ministry, there are about 700 applications for development of renewable energy sources.
The completion of these will provide about 600MW production, but the current distribution system can only be able to enter a part of this capacity.
The hydropower infrastructure and transportation routes are only one of the obstacles to the development of renewable energy resources in Croatia.
"If the Union wants to establish a five-day preparation for its own house, 60,000 documentary documents and we need to be removed.
They include good optimism. "
Despite all challenges, Economy Minister Djuro Popac is optimistic.
"Currently, Croatia is currently hydropower plants for 18 years, and more than 3.5 tonnes of energy resources," Popijac said.
The renewable energy is crucial for the future of Croatia.
The bloc has pledged to fulfil its energy requirements by 2020 to at least 20% of production and consumers' energy needs by 2020.

"I am confident that the citizens of Serbia are able to see a better life and economic prospects for the EU, and I am convinced that we will defend the best organisation against Kosovo independence," he said.
Analysts say the early elections will be a referendum on Serbia 'aspirations -- the pro-European parties will win the EU, if the nationalist parties will win their own.
The fight against the fight is expected to be between Tadic and leaders of the DS, Vojislav Seselj, in The Hague.

Political parties in Serbia have repeatedly submitted talks on the new government earlier this month, and Belgrade economists say that the coalition, led by Serbian President Boris Tadic, is likely to win the security of foreign investors in the coalition, led by the European Democratic Party (DS).

DSS and Radicals claim that Serbia will recognise the agreement on February 17th, saying it would not recognise the independence of Kosovo.
If the Serbian Radical Party and the Socialist coalition has formed the new government, foreign investors will be able to see how Belgrade is operating with the EU.
However, he said, the DS and Socialists "will not restore investors" for their future governments since 2000.
Economist Jurij Bajec said Serbia is "needs a government that will provide a direct foreign investment to ensure a 7% GDP growth in the next year".
"For this year, foreign investments should provide 2 billion euros for foreign direct investment and a long-term payment of 2 billion euros," Bajec said.
The external foreign investment initiative, he added, is "a pro-European government" that the EU is the economic partnership of Serbia.
"A pro-European government that will implement European standards is not only in Europe, but will ensure security and stability for all world investors, including Russia, China and India," Bajec said.
However, some are different.
Economist Judge Dusanic said foreign interests have invested more privatisation in Serbia, while the potential investors have been falling.
According to a special report by the Belgrade daily Policy, the new government would not be difficult to attract foreign investment through the sale of major assets, such as the oil and power utility.
Economist Russia and Children use the benefits of the Economic and Chinese investments, says it is important that the country is not in power or that it is not the conditions such as investors.

According to the EC, EU member states show much progress on education targets
The bloc members can only close only one of the five targets that the EU wants to be fulfilled by 2010.
Among other four goals, the European Commission said progress is in the central level.
By Svetla Dimitrova for Southeast European Times in Sofia -- 28 / 01 / 08

According to the European Commission (EC) progress report in November, EU member states need to make further efforts to meet all five training targets in the next three years.
The other targets have reached only one, Brussels said, adding that other targets remain a serious issue for education and education systems in Europe.
During a meeting in March 2000 in Lisbon, EU leaders agreed that "the bloc" aims to become the most competitive and religious economy in the world.
As part of this aim, joint goals for improving education and textile systems in Europe have been set up in 2002.
The primary primary school is reduced to 10 per cent, reducing the number of students at least 20 per cent, and at least 85 per cent of the young people are enjoying training.
Among other targets, the number of students in the Municipal, Fund and Technology (MFT) has increased by at least 15 per cent, and the need to create the necessary environmental environmental environmental environment, including reducing the quality of the population of 12.5 per cent.
In a annual progress report on the Lisbon training targets in 2005, the EC says the Union could be able to meet its targets for the MFT.
"If the current climate continues, the number of people in the EU in 2010 will spend up to 1m euros from 850,000 students, which are in the poorest and technology," the EC said in its report.
Among the best performance of the number of MFT per cent in the 25-year-old group, Irish (24.5), France (22.5) and Lithuania (18.9), while Slovenia, Portugal, Portugal, Italy and Italy ranked the most powerful growth rates for more than 100 per cent.
In other news, however, the report said that there are many progress in reducing the discrimination between the MFT mechanisms and that some 30.8 per cent in 2000 have reached 31.2 per cent year-on-year, compared to 2005.
Estonia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania are the best performance of the CFT distribution distribution distribution.
It is the highest country in 2005, with 46.9 per cent of the EU.
According to the report, there is no gender equality. [EU]
However, the EC says that "the major part of the new generation will face risk from the society, and that" the situation will lead to serious consequences for both the economy and society. "
A 2.3 per cent increase in the number of students who have been working for improvements since 2000.
In 2006, however, the share of the EU average of 15.3 per cent in 2006, the situation showed that the situation should be more efforts to ensure that the students from the end of 2010 should not be able to pay 10 per cent.
"The goal of Europe is to encourage youth, youth to encourage education or textbooks in education after the challenge process," the report said.
"There is a training success in the level of education, which is seen as a primary priority of the participation of the economy," he said.
Slovenia (5.2 per cent), the Czech Republic (5.5 per cent), Poland (5.6 per cent), Slovenia (6.3 per cent), Finland (8.3 per cent), Austria (8.3 per cent), Austria) and EU member Norwegian (5.9 per cent) were among the countries' best performance in 2006.
Malta and Portugal were the worst performance in the bloc, with 41.7 per cent and 39.2 per cent, respectively.
The 15-year-old group has not made any progress in improving the quality of students.
The number of successful students increased by 19.4 per cent in 2000 to 19.8 per cent in 2003.
It shows that most of the EU should be more difficult to ensure that a 15.5 per cent stake in the 15.5 per cent zone should be part of the group, according to EU statistics. According to statistics in 2003, the bloc was Finland (5.7 per cent) and Iran (5.7 per cent).
"It is the first step towards the participation of the information community.
However, the 5m-euro students from the EU have shown low success for the school, "he said.

According to the EC report, at least 85 per cent of those in the EU have not made enough progress to complete education by 2010.
"Over 80 per cent of those who have completed education in the EU, and there has been many increase since 2000," the commission said.
Over 90 per cent, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia are the best performance of the bloc, while they are Portugal, Malta and Spain.
In 2002, EU countries have decided to live in the training process of 12.5 per cent of the population of 25-64, and that goal is to participate in competitiveness, competitiveness and economic performance with the Union and the public, and the personal exercises of personal exercise.
Denmark, Britain and Finland are among other member states for this goal.
In these countries, the number of participants in the education and textile process last year was 9.6 per cent, compared to the EU average of 9.6 per cent, and 26.1 per cent, respectively, respectively.
The worst performance is Bulgaria and Romania, with 1.3 per cent of these countries, while Greece ranked 1.9 per cent to 1.9 per cent.
"It is important that Europe is a information society, and it is important to offer the highest quality of education and textbooks for competitive competitiveness in the world economy.
Nevertheless, this report shows that member states must show more efforts to fulfil the conditions of education and textile system in order to fulfil the 21st century.
"We need to invest more effective in the human capital," he said.

The first goal of Romania in the Athens Olympics is to join the 15 countries.
The country is more active than four years ago. In 2000, Romanian athletes won 11 gold medals and was ranked 11th in the country.
However, the gymnastics are facing the Olympic team for this year.
Athens 2004 could be a good opportunity for women, such as Catalina del Ponte.
"We are expected to see some expectations in the athletes, such as the death and scandal / / / homic, crisis and destruction," said Ion Tiriac, former Romanian Olympic Committee head of the Olympic Committee.
Florin Popescu and Silviu Simonceu, the Olympic championship, can represent their performance in the championship.

The former Serbian government, led by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, issued a draft law on a new ruling coalition to reach an agreement on a new ruling coalition.
The bill is expected to block President Boris Tadic 'Democratic Party, as the NGOs argue the removal of public transparency are positive assessments.
According to the new law, the findings will be able to cover former goods, or not be removed.
Serbian citizens have promised about 73,000 euros for the removal of Montenegro and the rest of other goods.
The bill is calling for reconstruction of "resources" that must be built before the former owners of agriculture.

"The draft bill is not equal to the former owners who have been forced to buy the methods," Pavlovic said.
According to Parvanov, however, the bill aims to protect the interests of national citizens as well.
"The bill does not work to protect the consequences of former goods, but the law must protect the macroeconomic policy.
In addition, it must protect the interests of the medical owners and make it more efficient, "he said.

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is weakened since the conflict and the former Yugoslavia were part of the 1990s.
At the same time, the country has been moved with four factors: Preftis in Vodafa, Konjic, the Visitz Foundation in Sarajevo, Zadar, Cavec, Mostar in Banja Luka, Mostar, Mostar and Technology Institute in Budvica, and Technology Foundation of Technology and Technology.
The defence sector was a total of 825m euros in 1986. In 2009, the BiH Foreign Affairs Committee was around 45m euros, according to official data.
It is more important to have the effect on the basis.
Following the war in BiH, 40,000 people worked in defence industry, and today, about 3,000 have been detained.
While many local economists continue to continue "the compromise of BiH", the industry has been passed due to a decision by the country, which has been determined with the two sides.
"The armed or ammunition is not the only state level of commercial or ammunition, and it must be able to give the entity at the level of commercial operations for such a commercial operations," said BiH defence ministry spokesperson Urinanovic. "The State Trade Ministry of Commercial Trade is not the final approach for commercial commercial operations
Some BiH companies, which have been removed to their own families, have failed to invest some demands, such as Switzerland, Britain and Egypt last year.

The bill offers more recognition of Belgrade -- Pristina talks
Western states are preparing a new draft resolution on the future of Kosovo and Kosovo Albanian officials to reach an agreement on the province ’ s final status.

The UN Security Council members will likely meet on Wednesday (June 20th) for a new draft resolution on the future of Kosovo and Pristina on the status talks.
The document, drafted by the United States and EU countries, reportedly will be recognised for four months to reach an agreement.
According to Reuters, the negotiations are not reached with the agreement, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari will implement the Kosovo plan.
The former Finnish president advised Kosovo to declare independence under EU control, including the constitution, unilateral and international organisations.
The Ahtisaari plan calls for protecting all minority groups in the province, particularly Kosovo Serbs.
According to the plan, a International Civilian Office will be appointed to protect the agreement.
This will be the UN and the EU, and this will have the authority of law and to send officials.
KFOR continues to ensure security in the province, while the EU will serve as a police mission that will help the "influence of the rule of law, fair and representative".
Kosovo Albanians acknowledged the plan for 90% of the province &aposs population of 2 million people, while insisting that Kosovo remains a sovereign sovereignty.
Russia, which supports Belgrade &aposs request for continuing talks on the future of the province, has threatened to use any UN Security Council resolution that would not be acceptable for Serbia.
Welcoming that possible, Western countries have offered to offer a proposal for a special envoy to Moscow, which would be changed as ethnic Serbs.
Belgrade has been pushing on the province, after NATO airspace is under UN mandate.
So far, Serbian forces have taken measures against ethnic Albanians who want independence.
During a visit to Athens on Tuesday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic reiterated Belgrade 'call for continuing talks with Pristina, while reiterating its stalemate on full independence for Kosovo.
"We want to speak, we want to speak, and we are ready to reach a deal.
We are ready to see all options, because we believe that any compromise is more better than a consensus, a solution, "he said." Our position is that we will not be able to give our country 'sovereignty and territorial integrity. "
The new talks between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders, however, are warning that Ahtisaari will be more efficient.
About 14-month talks ended earlier this year, when the two sides were not a major change.
The Kosovo administration, which praised the province to find a solution to the status issue, said it is opposed to any new talks with Belgrade.
"The Ahtisaari package is unacceptable," the Kosovo negotiating team spokesperson for the Belgrade-based Beta news agency quoted Ivan Hyseni as saying on Tuesday. "The Kosovo status of Kosovo could be accepted with alternatives.
This will be a member of the Security Council to block the process. "
Meanwhile, Ahtisaari said on Tuesday he expects Russia to block a Council decision on its own plan.
However, he said, Kosovo will likely be likely to declare independence by the end of this year.
He told Finnish television that if Moscow is forced to hand over the UN and the US support of Kosovo could be a solution.

The agreement focused on a number of technical issues such as the implementation of 68km of borders, joint construction projects, use of water resources, infrastructure and communications facilities, as well as border crossings and control.
The document envisions various activities in the region, such as disaster, water and architecture.
The accord was also important for both countries after years of negotiations.
The Soviet Union is part of Romania, which was part of the Soviet Union in 1940, and then expects Moldova to elect its independence in 1991.
Moldova is the only neighbouring country that Bucharest has signed the agreement.
Romania hopes to join 25 European countries in the Schengen zone by March 2011, which will be the border between Moldova and Moldova.
"We have already signed this agreement, claiming that some environmentalists in Moldova are" planning on the agenda ", Baconschi said in a joint statement after the award ceremony.
He cited Moldovan communities' accusations that the communist communities claim that Romania is territorial claims.
The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (AIE), one of the four parties in the ruling European Integration (AIE) coalition, said on Monday that the agreement would open the way for the opening of European border crossings in the country.
In Bucharest on Monday, European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso welcomed the agreement as a "obstacle" for the successful success, when it comes to mutual interest ".
Speaking at the opening of the Danube summit, Barroso said that this move is "a sign that Moldova is" appropriate to the EU ".
Romanian Prime Minister Baconschi said his support was "confident that Barroso" has made it clear that he would "continue to resume this bilateral relationship in the framework of a good European affairs.
"We want this road to the Republic of Moldova and we want to see this border as long as all requirements are fulfilled by the EU to become a limited border," he said.
Following EU Accession, Relations for Future Protection
[EU] Bulgaria and Romania have pledged to foster aspirations to the EU and Romania as a result of the necessary reforms for membership in the Union.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 21 / 04 / 03
During the latest EU meeting in Copenhagen, Bulgaria and Romania have been granted demands for reforms needed to join the EU.
Talks are deeply disappointed, but many questionnaire are unfortunately.
A series of EU normal and institutional unity (EU) union, the EU rules reflect national law, only a technical environment.
If the conclusion is more convinced, the real functioning of local institutions, social and economic performance is seen as a precondition for the image of Acis'.
Therefore, the European Commission stressed the need for reforms in public administration and legal areas and the fight against corruption.
The reforms that want the EU to take place are more easy than the need to create a "precedent" market economy, as well as a liberal democracy.
For this reason, the EU is the way of a institutional structure, which is designed to develop a organised development and designed.
Among them, national conditions, institutional and functioning are also aiming to facilitate closer economic development.
The Union needs a number of institutions, which will not require a different situation.
Despite the current economic differences, the EU is one of the economies and communities.
Therefore, Bulgaria and Romania will not be repeatedly dismissed, and it faces a major obstacle to developing development.
Bulgaria and Romania are at 28% of the EU average, according to the Community Party.
The inflation rate is not easy to fulfil the criteria for Mastricht criteria for the budget deficit, budget deficits and exchange change change of foreign currency, and that criteria can block economic growth.
Even as the priority of accession, the economic policy can be limited, and a Oztoman economic policy could produce the capacity to cope with poor circumstances.
The "economic policy" is a matter that must be taken in front of the first enlargement chapter in 2004, but it is very clear that it can be achieved in other accession chapters.
EU participation in the future is contributing to the Union &aposs mandate, and the Union has made it clear that it is increasing economic performance in the past years, and the creation of a joint foreign policy of economic policies and a joint foreign policy of foreign policy in the region, while the EU could have to "take a difficult challenge" with the consensus of different consultations on the issue of
Another important outcome is that Acis' '' 'will be able to ensure that it will be able to provide certain benefits and smaller benefits.
It is not easily easy, and this is not easy to recognise these goods, and it can create a confidence problem for state officials, if the prices are expected.
The accession talks will be delayed under policy adjustments.
The reforms for the EU accession process will be more constructive and more efficient.
Despite the reality of his image, the relations with the EU are more optimistic than international financial institutions.
The EU could serve as a primary force for development and modernisation of the monuments.
Since the benefits of the institutional reforms, financial assistance can create many differences.
The EU will also provide "defence", when it comes to uncertainty and insufficient disappointments in the world.
However, there are many issues that have been open.
There are no policy problems, and these problems are the optimistic policy opponents, which are in order to address these problems, the current situation, the situation and the military must face the best level of foreign requirements, according to the basic conditions.
The policy will be able to cover the basis of a broad inflation economy (low inflation rate), to ensure the state budget deficit, enforcement of the budget deficit, and to ensure that the same budget deficit should be implemented, but it should not be removed in a stalemate.
For example, markets should be held in a way.
The policy should not block the decisions, because these decisions were repeatedly "insisting", it will be very high, if they are not able to see the real truth.
This is an example of liberalisation in the future.
The national industrial industry is believed to be able to enter the main industries in Europe.
state officials can play a role in this issue, such as tax evasion and industrial investments, such as better business conditions.
Such claims will not continue to support the risks and reduce successful companies.
There should be many improvements.
For this, the EU and other experts -- especially from the European Investment Bank -- have a very important role in financial assistance.
Experts in Portugal, Spain and Greece have shown that there can be a major improvement in EU aid.
The state budget should be more funding for education and health services.
This issue will require more competitive in the coming years.
As such as the labour, a better economy and taxes will be able to gain better progress.
The agriculture sector, which is a major part of the GDP, will be one of the issues that will have a major problem in accession talks.
This is a problem in the EU, and the legal support of the law should not be convinced.
The economic problem could be more than consensus of agriculture sectors, the basic basis of the young population to find business in the city.
This could revive the "disaster", if other industries do not provide sufficient jobs.
As the risk of increasing risks to work abroad, the business exports could be a opportunity to avoid a major social crisis, as well as the Roma 'democratic life in Europe (wage) and their differences.
Among these countries, Latin should stop a American type of transformation. The problem of co-operation with the EU is a successful issue.
In the near future, the "Great" could be a "friend".
The citizens who are working abroad abroad to the EU are seeking a significant amount of income in countries, and such private transportations are creating the general security system.
Belgrade Airport: Serbia [Customs]
The construction of the Belgrade airport is aimed at building a regional traffic centre in the Serbian capital.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 07 / 10 / 03
Most of the Belgrade airport, buildings and facilities were built by 27 years ago.
However, as part of the Serbian Club project, the airport will be transformed into a regional air traffic.
Today, loans will invest 500m euros in the project through commercial activities of the airport or 700m euros.
According to Serbian Transport Minister Marija Radosavavljevic, the two international architectures have a strong strategic position in the centre of Belgrade, which allows the city to establish any transformation.
The restructuring activities that aim to improve the quality of external and quality capacity, but also mean the restructuring of operations with the last technology.

Authorities from the US Transport Agency have come to the country.
Several options for expansion industries in the airport are being submitted.
Among them, the facility of a five-year-old hotel, which will allow the workers to be held in the business climate, is among plans.
The pipeline, which is planned, will not only connect the airport, will also be able to meet the goods in the centre, part of the project.
Currently, the US Agency for Reconstruction and Development has not yet yet agreed on the mobile and car centre, but the airport is expected to use 34 hectares in the environment.
The work on the international army is scheduled to be completed in May 2004.
Our plans for the airport are the problem that the facility will be the problem.
Some propose that Zoran Djindjic, the prime minister of the assassination of Serbia.
As part of the New York airport, Chairman John F. Kenny argues that Serbia is in accordance with the Church, the prime minister was the prime minister who has been doing major efforts to open Serbia in the world.
Experts Urge EU to Full for Western Balkans
Some experts say the EU needs to develop its strategy for the Western Balkans and support.
(EUobserver - 19 / 03 / 03; European Stability Pact)
Experts on Southeast Europe have urged the EU to develop the approach of the Union on the Western Balkans -- to improve the impact of the United States.
Experts who attended a debate last month at the European Parliament on Foreign Relations said the EU needs to show more decisions on the need for support of the Western Balkan countries' membership prospects.
The conference was held in May to prepare the Stability Pact Conference on the Stabilisation Conference. The conference will be prepared for a preparation for the European Council meeting in Thessaloniki in June.
The Western Balkan countries, which will security for EU member states, will be invited as a "strategic summit" in the framework of the Greek forum.
Albania, Macedonia and Croatia signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (IOA) with the EU.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro have not yet signed.
Croatia submitted its application for EU membership in February. The application was made in a bid to join the Union with Bulgaria and Romania in early 2007.
Albania and Macedonia are planning to monitor Croatia in this year.
Vladimir Giorov of the Vienna International Economic Studies Institute said the IOA process is slowly slowly, and the Union has not shown that it does not support people in the region.
Glianov is widely warning that the EU is determined to provide support for the region.
In a speech to members of the Western Balkans, European Parliament (ESI) Chairman Gerald Krius told members of the European Parliament that the Western Balkans is not two basic threats today.
The EU could help overcome social and economic problems in the region, he said, adding that the Western Balkan countries will continue to continue their efforts to fight organised crime and organised crime.
He also suggested that the Union has proposed a joint movement with these countries to develop its own alliance.
A new report released by the ASME said the summit in Thessaloniki was three measures for success.
One of them will produce a concrete EU target in the Western Balkans as a concrete EU goal, which would mean more funds in the region and more interests in the region.
The report noted that a serious decision to ensure unity in the Western Balkans is being shown in the interest of major financial resources, as well as new assistance.
The second, he said, is now willing to show decisions on implementation of the provisions that have been unilateral politics.
According to the same document, the third quarter will be the determination of the level of assistance between the Western Balkan countries, such as Romania and Bulgaria, as well as the Western Balkan countries.
The ASME report suggested that it would be planned for the Western Balkans in 2006 and proposed that 500m euros -- only one of the GDP -- is expected to be made by Bulgaria and Romania by the same year.
Kurdish problem points to return
Turkey, which opened the debate between the state and Kurdish movements, was a critical time on the "Kurdish problem".
By Anna Wood for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 08 / 08 / 11
The BDP assembly boycotts the seats of the elected Kurdish lawmakers, who gathered in Diyarbakir, where it is a majority of the Kurdish population. [Reuters]
BDP, which supports the Kurdish population, has started to win 36 deputies in the general elections in June.
If independent candidates supported by the BDP have been repeatedly informed, the situation has been pushing after the elected lawmakers' elected Hatip Dicle 'election.
One of the parties' decision to respond to the bill is boycotted by parliament, saying it is not a member of parliament.
Henry Barack, a professor of political professor and Kurdish experts at the League University, said the situation is very worried.
Barack described Dicle as a "step forward that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and AKP" could be supported by the Kurdish Academy.
Other developments have come to the country 'largest opposition party, the Republic of Justice (CHP), but the party has ended its efforts to reach a compromise with the AKP.
However, the BDP seems to be a long-term solution for candidates.
The talks between the state and party representatives have not made any results so far.
The decision to enter parliament is criticised by some observers, such as the National Studies Institute for Strategic Studies President Denmark, who believes the BDP has been boycotting the parliament.
"The BDP has made another alternative to enhance both the political and political areas in the process of change, as well as to ensure that the Kurdish demands are more complicated," Natasa told SETimes.
According to Natasa, the party has repeatedly repeatedly condemned candidates to parliament and condemned that "progress in the negotiations can be made and that it is serious about the change of the Turkish state."
Democratic autonomy
The two sides in mid-July have been cautioned by the country.
The incidents were attacked by the Kurdish political operations in Turkey and the death of 13 soldiers in Diyarbakir.
Turkish soldiers have cautioned the outcome of the PKK attacks, improving Turkish nationalism in the country, and cautioned the discrimination between Turkish and Kurds. [Reuters]
This development has been increasing a new energy with Turkish nationalism, and also cautioned the risk of the Kurdish people and the BDP.
In the second time, the nationalist Kurdish movement could be described as a test for development.
The Democratic Society Congress (DTK) announced it plans to declare a "democratic autonomy" for the Kurds in Turkey, as the same day.
"This problem can only resolve the Kurds' recognition and unilateral status.
Although the Kurdish people threaten the presence of the Kurdish people, policies do not want to live as a status. "
"It is important that this plan is not only the problem to end violence and conflict.
At the same time, a democratic community will also allow the management of management. "
Tuncel also emphasised the DTK statements: other boycotts.
"We have two boycotts of the democratic autonomy.
"It is the process that we can be realised as a peacekeeping project and that the Kurdish problem is resolved for democratic and peace."
"The democracy project, which will allow all identity, cultural and minorities in Turkey, will allow freedom of expression and respect," he said.
The democratic autonomy of the Turkish state as "a threat to the territory of territorial integrity", however, showed that the democratic autonomy in Kurdish politics has been controversial.
The BDP has been a complex and effect among different organisations and doctors, including DTK, KCK, PKK, PKK and prison leader Abdullah Ocalan, but the nationalist Kurdish movement is developing, developing and demands of national and international level.
The state, media and the large part of the public is a clear fear of concerns about links between these groups, as a result of the PKK.
According to Natasa, the BDP should be realised, if it wants to have the state agenda.
"If the Kurds can make more progress in political climate, the BDP or the opposition are not a threat to the Kurds' demands and the demands of Kurds' demands and the stability of the Turkish state.
However, they are now doing full comprehensive. "
A free zone in Turkey could be implemented
The DTK statement is still questionable: How will it be fully a democratic system in Turkey and how will it be possible to implement it in the current political climate?
Asia or the majority groups of religious conflicts and minority groups could be an effective solution in some areas, as they have been consequences.
Spain, which is seeking a balance for the establishment of the 1978 constitution, has been a simple country that has been seen as one of the most successful achievements in a peaceful transition to autonomy.
Both are hosting the communities recognised by the state, Basescu and Katalonia, the free parliamentary and courts are managed by parliament and courts, and are protected by the federal government, which is approved by the head of the crisis.
The death of PKK deaths enjoy Kurdish nationalism. [Reuters]
Canadian could be an example of the countries, especially in the province of Queec.
Despite controversial debate over the autonomy level, this problem is not a solution in the political process.
However, Turkey and the Middle East are very different than the cultural events of Turkey and the Middle East, as well as opponents of autonomy and rhetoric, Spain and Canada.
One of the factors of the political autonomy is that any system needs to be very low: the Turkish state is a local government that has been opposed for years.
As an official, the state has a number of local policies, it is creating a system for both the effective and most of the identity.
In a country where the Kurdistan island has been imposed by the 1990s and the speaking of the speech of the Kurdistan island has been restricted in some restrictions -- could not be able to see the idea of autonomy.
Juf Racka, a professor at the Turkish University of Turkey in Finland, says the public should be tolerated to implement such solutions.
"The basis is is that a solution will be the general approach.
Canadians acknowledge that Quec is free.
The Finnish dialogue acknowledge that the Gaddafi is free.
Therefore, regional autonomy has been working in the fields of autonomy. "
KB, the founder of the bloc 'Committee for politics and the Kurdistan Community, is suspected that Turkey is ready to recognise such a autonomy.
"If the Kurdistan speaks as a threat to the state territorial integrity?
Since then, the Kurds must be recognised as a constitution and guarantees of judges. "
According to Natasa, the situation is not ready, but also in the state level.
"Turkish officials, institutions and political parties" are interested in the state union and stability of the state, "he said." The Kurdistan Workers [Kurds] Regional idea, security and unity of the Kurdistan Workers in Iraq. "
The unilateral decisions, such as the DTK, have no chance to change the real change in Turkey, according to Natasa.
"Everything changes to the institutions of the Turkish state and institutions, including the continuation of the Games, should be done in the framework of constitutional and administrative reforms, which will accept Turkish citizens and officials."
At the same time, he said that any possible reconciliation between the AKP and the AKP, which envisions more than nationalism to vote with the Kurdish population.
"It is the constitution.
However, Turkey needs a new constitution.
If Ankara does not do something on this matter, all needs have been pushed. "
The solution, meanwhile, is declining to resolve the solution, simply insufficient co-operation.
"It is difficult to stay on the issues," he said.
People are now aware of the real developments: there are no longer the worst reconciliation in the conflicts of conflict, "he said.

The Macedonian government is preparing a new law that will change the Charter Community and the Women of the OSCE.
However, controversial proposals that the European Commission called for a call for the move have been discussed.
The current law recognises a single committee for people who have a certain border.
The Macedonian Orthodox Church (COK) is recognised as a representative of the Orthodox churches, while the Islamic Community (IRC) represents Muslims.
The MOC, the IC and the Roman Catholic Catholic Church said that the current system is continuing to continue with the continuation of the current system.
The ideas of these ideas, supporters say the liberalisation will increase more freedom to elect religious groups to elect their own weapons.
According to the COK, however, Jovan Vrankovski, a documentary on the Macedonian Orthodox Church, will open the implementation of the Ohrid Patriarch in Macedonia.
Vranjkovski is also sentenced to prison in the prison sentence of Idrizovo, who is currently serving as prime minister.
The IC, meanwhile, says the proposed amendments would cause the independent Community.
Following a meeting between Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and MOK officials, the talks on amendments to the law would be resolved.
However, a certain solution was not elected.
The MOK has sent a letter to the Serbian Orthodox Church for ten years to propose dialogue on the name dispute.
The Serbian church has refused to recognise the MOK for religious independence, and is offering autonomy.
However, the COK has insisted its own constitution and insists it has a church.

Croatia will not participate in talks on EU free and capital exchange.
EU experts said the process was not in accordance with European standards, and that the Croatian mechanisms should be implemented.
"Overall, the EU states have no legal restrictions," the European Commission said.
As a major tourist industry, Croatia has a major market for foreign tourists.
EU citizens are also interested in the areas of widespread hotels and agencies.
However, EU lawyers in the country are not willing to open the free market, which will be sold.
According to the local law, the foreign affairs and companies who want to remove refugee in Croatia must be signed by the foreign ministry, which should be signed by the justice ministry.
This process can be allocated for years.
While the foreign ministry has decided to apply any application, Croatia and its application is not a compromise between the country.
The procedure for the citizens of Italy, Germany and Austria is more difficult for their citizens.
This is a number of Croatian citizens who live in these countries.
Authorities and companies do not have an agriculture or expert in Croatia.
Therefore, it is expected to offer a cultural heritage in protecting the protection, the Federation, regional and municipalities.
However, they refused to use the right to purchase a procurement for them, while the refugee citizens and companies can be offered.
Among other EU members concerning tourism, they are facing similar problems in Croatia in the accession process.
Another example that the negotiations can be given, Malta said that the negotiations could complete the country 'minimum market in seven years.
According to the agreements signed with the EU, Croatia must liberalise its market by 2009.
Turkish Cypriots controversy in Nicosia
Turkish Cypriots have met one of the preconditions for a new transition point in the divided island of Nicosia.

Turkish Cypriots unveiled on Tuesday (January 9th) the plans to open a transition point in the divided island of Nicosia in Nicosia in late 2005.
Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat announced his decision last year to eliminate the controversial controversial removal of the Latis Club, one of the most important symbolic symbols of Nicosia.
According to Greek Cypriots, it was built in an effort to boost Turkish military forces in the region.
Talat plans to eliminate the structure were criticised by the chief of the General Staff of Turkey, General Yildiz Gul.
"It is not a problem for us, but this steps should be done," the AFP quoted him as saying Sunday, noting that during a meeting with the Turkish military in Ankara.
After the meeting, Talat said that the Greek Cypriot authorities are still applied as a precondition for the restructuring of the Ledras Club.
"Our goal is to open the opening of the transition," said Ozgur Murat, senior Turkish Cypriot officials on Tuesday. "We have to do as Turkish Cypriots."
Among other preconditions for the restructuring of the Greek Cypriots' Ledras Caddafi, the restoration of Turkish soldiers and restoration of neighbouring buildings.
"The aim to open the Ledras Club is a safe movement and creating a mutual confidence environmental environment between the two communities," the Greek Cypriot government spokesperson Kodoros Pasaridis said on Tuesday.
Turkish Cypriots, who hopes to open the UN peacekeeping talks with the Greek Cypriot part, described the decision as a good sign of controversial reconciliation.
However, Pakidis said on Tuesday that the high-ranking era would not be removed to the Turkish Cypriots or a compromise.
"It should be repeatedly seen as an instrument to eliminate this law, but it should be removed with consultations that will be given," the Cyprus News Agency quoted him as saying.
A questionnaire on the Greek Cypriot authorities plans to reunify the National Assembly in Ledras Caddas, Pacaridis said that the government is ready to discuss proposals for a transition point in Cyprus over the main period.
Since 2003, one of the barricades have been opened in the centre of Nicosia, where the peacekeepers were the first in the 1963 interethnic conflict between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.
Cyprus has been divided into the northern and Greek government since 1974, when Turkish soldiers revealed a third of their territory.

The European Commission (EC) announced a move that Turkish Cypriots accepted the support of international efforts to reunify Cyprus, the island has announced a number of proposals for liberalisation of trade with the northern part of the island, as well as 259m euros.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said the EU is continuing its long-term target to reunify Cyprus and Greek parts.
"We use the aim of the plan, to end the island of the Turkish Cypriot community and use different options to do so," Verheugen said.
In a referendum on 24 April, Greek Cypriots rejected the plan for a reunification plan, while Turkish Cypriots approved the plan.
As a result of the vote, only the Greek Cypriots joined the EU on 1 May.
"The best thing is that the Turkish Cypriots are not able to leave their Turkish Cypriots," Verheugen said.
The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (KTC), which is recognised by Turkey, has been on the basis of international peacekeeping and sanctions since 1974.
Currently, Turkish Cypriot products are being exported abroad.
However, new proposals will be allowed to free trade with northern Cyprus, including food products.
Verheugen cited infrastructure projects between the EU and the potential projects that will be financed by the EU, climate resources, resources and long-term tourist initiatives -- as well as infrastructure projects in tourism, agriculture and electricity.
He said the EU is intended to support joint projects between both Turkish and Turkish Cypriot authorities.
Among the proposals that the Council of Europe will take effect after the meeting in September, the trade "Year" was organised by the two communities.
The EC movement is a key political milestone for Turkish Cypriots, while Verheugen stressed that the proposals are not recognised by the Turkish Cypriots or not to recognise the recognition of the KTC.
"We do not know that a Turkish state in the Eastern Mediterranean is not interested," Verheugen said.
Nevertheless, Greece and Cyprus have been criticised by the Greek Cypriots.
Greek Foreign Ministry spokesperson Giorgos Kumios described the EU '' repression with the KTC as a "negative point".
Meanwhile, Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister Giorgos Jakovou said the package was based on pro-political interests and the law on concrete basis.
The Greek side has also called for free trade consumption, especially if it does not have the right to.
However, Greece does not expect Greek Cypriots to offer a 259m-euro tender for the Council of Europe.
Del Ponte War Crimes Prosecuting Lebances for War Crimes Prosecutors
UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte cited the war crimes tribunal in The Hague that Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic will not close their doors before the trial.
(Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, HINA - 12 / 09 / 03)
Following his mandate for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), del Ponte said the priority is the list of all remaining fugitives.
He said the court would not close the doors of Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and his Croatian General Ante Gotovina before the end of 2003, saying it would not be closed to them.
The third is on the list of 17 war crimes suspects that have been found in the polls.
"The Croatian government must hand over Ante Gotovina to The Hague," del Ponte said at a press conference Friday (September 12th).
Bosnian Serbs are focusing on all co-operation with Karadzic, "he said.
As part of a strategy adopted by the UN Security Council, the ICTY must complete all investigations by the end of 2004, all mechanisms must be completed by the end of 2008.
The programme will be implemented by 2010.
However, del Ponte cautioned that the completion strategy could be dangerous if the efforts to capture suspects at the beginning of the list are completed.
Mladic and Karadzic are charged with genocide because of their role in the 1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the Srebrenica massacre.
Del Ponte, who said Mladic is in Serbia, called for authorities to hand over the suspect.
Karadzic is believed to be hiding in Republika Srpska, which is part of the Serb administration in BiH.
Gotovina, who has since since 2001, has been charged with crimes against Serb civilians during a attack against Serb civilians during a 1995 attack.
Del Ponte claims that Croatian authorities are hiding.
"I think it is the Croatian government and the Croatian government, General Ante Gotovina," del Ponte said.
He said the court will continue to help the international community to surrender to justice, adding that those people are not aware of success and trial.
"I will not see this possibility.
Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina will be arrested by the end of the year and will be transferred to the tribunal.
The court will not close its doors if Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina are in front of the judiciary, "the court said.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said on Friday that the government "does not have any contact with General Gotovina".
"The Croatian service has shown that he is in Croatia and it will be arrested so far," he said.
Racan called on the tribunal to hand over him that he would be good for both the country and to hand over retired generals.
In a statement, Croatian President Stipe Mesic urged Gotovina to hand over his own and Croatia to defend him in The Hague.

Sarkozy faces obstacle between Turkey and EU
The French president has become a concrete step towards Europe 'EU bid, but Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has increased dialogue with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
By A. Award for Southeast European Times -- 20 / 04 / 10

During a meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy earlier this month in Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy cautioned that France could revive Turkey &aposs stance towards EU membership.
Erdogan met with Sarkozy on April 8th.
The French president is a strong opposition to Ankara.
Turkey has the largest GDP in Europe with 64.8 billion euros, and has an increase of 6.5% over the past five years.
Therefore, it is not higher than all other candidates, but there is no sustainable level for many EU member states.
Turkey and European partners have played significant role in the Iranian nuclear crisis, security situation in Afghanistan and improving stability in Iraq.
Nevertheless, the country &aposs role in increasingly smaller plan is not revealed.
Sarkozy argues that "Europe" undermines its borders and "is not a member of all European countries."
The French president insists that Turkey is not limited in these borders.
This is the official position since Sarkozy was power in 2007.
However, a recent visit by Erdogan -- Sarkozy -- could give it a change to Turkey &aposs image.
"The most important outcome of Erdogan 'visit to Turkey this year is that Sarkozy will accept Sarkozy' invitation to visit Turkey," Dr. Cengiz Altler, a member of the Bahhabit University in Istanbul, told SETimes.
"Sarkozy has changed the idea of the idea on all policy issues from Turkey since the presidential mandate," he said. "But in the last time, the French business sector has been under pressure on all competitiveness against Turkish opponents.
We can now see Sarkozy is now clear that the strong opposition to Turkey is on the way to move forward, "Sarkozy said.
Erdogan said that bilateral relations, including the French president and military relations, are likely to discuss the possibility of co-operation in resolving regional and regional issues.
"I hope that Sarkozy will assume Sarkozy this year and we will discuss our steps towards the future," he said.
Turkey and France have similar talks on NATO allies and many foreign policy issues.
Nevertheless, the latest French official visit to Turkey was former French President Franis Mitar in 1992.
Sarkozy leader Jacques Chirac was described as a friend of Turkey.
In support of Chirac, Turkey began its accession talks with the EU in 2004.
However, Sarkozy criticised the opening of the 35 chapters of accession talks with Turkey, which opposes full membership.
Another problem is that Ankara has not received a strong political support from France to resolve the Cyprus issue.
He says he is "a French" of Sarkozy ".
"Sarkozy aims to support the support of voters from Islam, and it seems to do so to oppose Turkey," Sarkozy said. "Sarkozy will have a new policy that would have a new policy for France, or be elected by the president or elected by the president."
Among other EU members, such as Italy, Italy and some northern European countries have strong support for full EU membership, while the country has a bridge in the Islamic world.
Germany has offered a "optimistic partnership", which is not accepted by Ankara.
One of the strongest supporters of Turkey &aposs EU membership is Spain, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
The chapters on education and food security will likely be open for Turkey by the end of the year, Spanish state minister for European Affairs Diary Lopez Gouz said last week.

The Republika Srpska (RS) parliament, the entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), has called for all war crimes suspects, including wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, to face arrest if they are hiding.
In a decision on co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on Tuesday (July 20th), lawmakers also asked the government to step up its obligations to The Hague tribunal.
The document proposed by RS President Dragan Cavic was supported by lawmakers in the 83 seat parliament, Reuters reported.
The international community has made it clear that BiH has made full co-operation with the ICTY, including the arrest of war crimes suspects indicted for war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict.
The RS has yet to arrest a single war crimes suspect and not co-operate with the tribunal, and that BiH has not been invited to join NATO ’ s Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme.
Karadzic, one of the 20 ICTY suspects in the situation, has been surrendered since 1996, and has reportedly been hiding in the country 'distribution of supporters.
Following a decision to assume BiH 'participation in the PfP, the top international envoy in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, announced a broad measures aimed at ensuring co-operation with the ICTY.
Under the measures, 59 Bosnian Serb officials believed to be obtained.
Among them, the leader of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), led by Karadzic, and RS Parliament Speaker Dragan Kalinic and interior minister, Zoran Ceric.
On Tuesday, the government urged the interior ministry to take all necessary changes to ensure that the entity police will have the operational war crimes suspects.
The document also calls for a draft bill on the establishment of the investigation of crimes committed during the BiH conflict, documents and assessment.
The lawmakers, who also voiced full support for BiH 'integration into NATO' Euro-Atlantic structures through the Stabilisation and Association Process and the EU, have called for "all institutions in BiH to condemn war crimes by representatives of the citizens of BiH."
Earlier this day, 44 of lawmakers participated in the special session were elected by Dusan Stojicic, 40, and the new president of parliament.
According to the AP, Stojicic, a SDS spokesperson, believes that Karadzic is among those who have helped justice.
However, Ashdown called on RS on Tuesday to adopt a decision on the BiH Constitutional Court on geography.
In a letter to RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic, Ashdown cautioned that amendments to the RS cabinet have been removed from the RS cabinet have been suggesting that the amendments to "Television" are completely insufficient.
He also noted that the cabinet was sold as the Foca / Srbije facility, which was called for the Foca Foca.
Ashdown said the court decision is clear and difficult, adding that Mikerevic is a personal responsibility for the removal.

According to the current law, the ambassadors should be able to diplomat from diplomats, while the residents could have a number of main persons or political parties in the past.
Analysts say the agreement between Crvenkovski and Gruevski could be able to improve co-operation between the two sides.
The agreement came after NATO and the EU criticised the political dialogue to resolve various issues, the agreement said.

As part of the August 23rd Bajrami Summit, citizens in Macedonia have spent more than 400m euros, as part of the event, celebrated on Wednesday (November 23rd).
About 250,000 people attended the event.
Boris Trajov, an international operator of the nurses Bajrami, told SETimes that the event won the popular popular popularity in the coming years to transform a global environmental environmental environment.
"This project has created a difference to protect citizens in the long-term term to protect the environment and improving the environment.
In addition, Macedonia is also allowing it to take a symbolic steps towards closing the Balkan and other citizens.
He said the idea came after the idea was recognised by Macedonia and the region in 2006 and 2007.
Regardless of the defendants, Trajov said he should declare a day for experts who are not known as the media, and called for a "plan" and called for the removal of the men and the justice.
Therefore, it was completed, and many have taken action to achieve him.
Several days later, Trajanov has established a strong initiative of the number of supporters.
"However, we have created a day for the future [the] new experts," he said.
A major party in the ruling coalition, the Democratic Renewal of Macedonia (DOM), is supporting similar initiatives for environmental, environmental and humanitarian contributions.
"We are aware of the need for a decade of hundreds of people, and we are aware that the new vehicles are needed," DOM President Ljiljana Popovska told SETimes.
Popovska said the DOM wants to see this initiative to see the influence of the census and more cities.
Last year, Balkan countries agreed that Macedonia has proposed a proposal to turn into a regional project in Copenhagen.
"We have agreed to establish a partnership with the six Balkan countries as the Balkan Black Sea Charter.
This will create a more efficient Balkan image.
We will recognise us as a leader of the system as an advisory, "he said.
Following the Copenhagen decision on March 30th, Pescheja was working in the Macedonian border area, including the Polico and Mediterranean municipalities in Albania, including the Policy and Asia and Kushi municipalities in Bulgaria.
Protection studies in Macedonia are being organised by the Macedonian Orthodox, and the establishment of the company Bajrami is under action plan.
This year, the board celebrated the decision to declare the World War II by August 2011.
"More than 65% of the 38m euros have been revealed -- this is a stalemate.
European standards are successful to the average average of 35%.
We have no low success in the first years, but we have a comprehensive approach and we have a higher quality, "he said.
He said that Macedonian authorities are planning to exercise the rhetoric in the region, because many need to have supervised and other assets.
"The Macedonian Orthodox has sufficient equipment, and the board is prepared to help other countries, especially in Kosovo and Bulgaria.
Nevertheless, the countries should be in accordance with reconciliation practices on bilateral co-operation, "he said.
Authorities predict that citizens have 44m euros, including the latest nine Baykal.
Macedonia is characterised by its experts as a national exhibition and heritage.
The country has signed a number of international agreements and consortium, which affects the environmental sector, and approved them.
The Civilian industry was recognised by all ministries, but all ministries are supported by the Macedonian government, including the Local Studies Agency, municipalities, municipalities and public company Macedonian Orthodox.
This year, ambassadors in Macedonia attended the Baykal.
EC seeks more compliance on Eurozone members
The European Commission has submitted a new package of measures that would allow other Eurozone countries to cover their goods.

The European Commission (EC) met on Wednesday (November 23rd) the two new mechanisms for the 17 Eurozone countries to boost their authority on national budget and strengthen control over the member states facing serious financial problems.
The amendments are part of a three-year plan to resolve the crisis in the Eurozone, which aims to resolve the eurozone and recognise a joint growth of the EU "Stabilisation Forces", which is recognised by 2012.
"In order to return, EU member states need to boost their commitments for structural reforms, as well as to complete their quality with the Eurozone," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
"The targets of this package -- economic growth, financial stability, budget disciplinary -- are linked to one," Barroso said at a joint press conference with EU Economic and Paralities Commissioner Olli Rehn. "We need to move forward to Europe that the current situation is strengthened by strengthening responsibility."
In one of the two new arrangements proposed, the Eurozone countries' budget deficits for the next year, the Commission and Eurodox are expected to submit their own parliament.
The countries must do so before October 15th, when they have to announce their budget plans for the next 12 months.
The second legal measures will allow the Eurozone countries in the region to help serious financial problems or other countries in the region, to bring the European Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the IMF and the IMF in the level of insufficient rescue programmes.
Earlier this year, the idea of joint billion-euro billions in the Eurozone was considered one of the targets of the crisis.
The EC submitted a controversial analysis on Wednesday with a 38-page Year Belgium to submit a detailed analysis of the three electoral opponents that have been supported by the 17-nation Stabilisation and Association Prosecutor.
The decision is expected to participate in all stakeholders and is expected to decide after a broad consensus on January 8th.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated his position Wednesday.
Merkel also urges the European Central Bank (ECB) to overcome its role in efforts to overcome the debt crisis.
"It is very important that the commission has offered a variety of billion-euro proposals so far, it is a stable situation," the German parliament quoted him as saying.
Germany could sell a five-year price on the market, which is only 3.9 billion euros in the market.
This architecture caused concerns that Europe is likely to avoid the crisis.
The threats in the eurozone have increased in recent years, when France, the second largest country in the eurozone, could lose its credit rating.
"The crisis is defined by increasingly on the rise, while Merkel is one of the disasters of the overall policy of the business policy," Bloomberg quoted Sean Dullie, a senior member of the Council of European Relations in Berlin, as saying in an telephone interview Thursday.
"It is a success."
One of the main aspects of the Berlin 'joint Eurozone consultations is that the major country will be able to impose financial problems.
Petar Ganev, a senior economist at the Institute for Economic Economic, is expected to discuss a serious debate in the coming weeks.
"It is clear that different positions on the Council are open," Ganev told SETimes. "It is difficult to resolve the problem that all eurozone countries will be resolved by a new debt that will be completed by completing all eurozone countries.
The new debt is a smaller phase that the current debt will help resolve the problems that have a sustainable level. "
Other experts and analysts believe that the bills will be an important factor to resolve the debt crisis in the Eurozone, but stressed the need for measures.
"There is a psychological paper on the global debt and we are in a crisis (for both countries) and banks," Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European Policy, told SETimes. "We can only be able to see the crisis of the ECB crisis.
However, the ECB could do so more financial integration and the euro.
Therefore, the bills could be one of the basic factors of any crisis. "
Former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu voiced doubt that the Eurozone would continue to move forward to revive its common policy, and if it is not a step forward to a more financial integration.
"The rules, as well as sanctions.
However, financial rules are not enough, but there is no lack of a strong financial arrangement that must contain a joint preparation, "he said." The government is not enough, but not to make a financial mechanism that will recommend the recommendations and penalties.
At the same time, the Eurozone needs a joint currency unit that will meet in order to live. "
The policy should provide "a joint arrangement and fiscal presence", as well as the joint decision on common mechanisms, Daianu said, noting the need for "a joint venture", which will cover joint billion-euro bills.
According to Daianu, there will be a greater political integration for all of them.
"A money will not be able to functioning on a joint arrangements (large financial supporters), including a joint arrangement and financial markets," the former prime minister said. "It is a step forward on this issue."
EU leaders are expected to discuss the package and ideas at the summit on December 9th.

Romania aims to boost use of EU funds
How can the country be achieved as well as improving EU funds?
Leonard Orthodox, a new ministry on this issue, says the issue is on the issue.
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 25 / 11 / 11

Former EU Enlargement Commissioner Leonard Orthodox was appointed to the European Commission for the use of EU funds, which has recently established Romania.
Romania is the largest of the bloc members.
SETimes correspondent Paul Ciocoiu speaks about the challenges of the Orthodox.
SETimes: Do you have a decision to form a ministry of ministry to help EU funds?
Leonard Orthodox: I hope that this questionnaire will not be able to say.
SETimes: How do you see problems that have been able to benefit from EU funds?
Do you think that there is a written?
Orthodox: We have made a key assessment of EU funds and the authorities, including the management of EU funds.
We have decided to take a series of measures aimed at improving the primary growth rate.
The challenges and challenges -- insufficient management capacity and the lack of certain control in this area.
We believe the differences between state institutions and better performance are aware of the previous funds that Romania will join the EU, as well as the priority funds for accession funds.
Others face major challenges in order to implement these funds.
At the same time, we have found challenges that are preparing the projects and then they face.
These challenges are more complicated procedures.
In addition, such as the banking sector, there are challenges about the participation in the private sector.
However, I have made it clear: But we are facing specific interest in the system.
SETimes: Do you have any statistical statistics on the projects?
Orthodox: There are no incidents, but there are no evidence.
The Anti-corruption agency has a clear visa-free visits on projects, such as projects in the investigation.
However, there are no significant number of people.
SETimes: However, if the number is decreased?
We do not have a reality, because we have a lot of restrictions, so that we have the risk of the risk of such incidents.
Public purchase, the European Commission has faced problems with the system.
Therefore, we have changed the system.
SETimes: Do you have the procedures of the Public distribution system and what are the main measures to do so?
Orthodox: The legal amendments are under measures, including changes in the system.
The second includes two state structures responsible for the public purchase of EU funds in management mechanism.
This means that the two institutions will be responsible for their responsibility.
So far, no one has been responsible for its decisions.
They participate in the system and operations, and they need to be done to ensure that these institutions are responsible.
In order to avoid these changes, we risk the risk of suspension of EU funds for six months to six months.
Therefore, we are the main priority for reform in the public procurement system.
SETimes: What are the main targets for the period?
In order to benefit from EU funds, I stressed that at least 20% by 2013.
This means that 3.1 billion euros will be affected by the end of 2012.
This figure has allocated 716m euros in spending so far.
SETimes: Some environmental resources in the EU argue that the funds, which have not achieved a key part of the EU budget -- should be less than the 2014 budget.
Orthodox: It is an armed force that wants to reduce its share in the EU budget, and the member states used to contribute to a clear contribution.
Can Romania, Bulgaria and other countries have so much money?
"We will have to submit two armed forces.
First, they need to improve the situation and improve the situation, as well as the EU is in poor countries, with the financial policy.
Recent and more developed countries are in the EU to reduce differences.
If I do not happen, the EU is not possible.
SETimes: How do you think that Romania could be better on the economic crisis?
Orthodox:
"I see Poland, which protects the high level of EU funds.
They acknowledged that economic growth is high.
And not only infrastructure, they have invested in projects that have created economic growth.
Tai is the infrastructure for a country such as Romania.
This is a precondition.
We need to invest in the fields of development, which has many of the economy.
SETimes: Roma funds are very complicated and bureaucracy.
How do you think the programmes and project criteria?
Orthodox: This funds are not easy.
We have to see many challenges that are difficult to eliminate the complicated procedures and eliminate.
However, in this area, I think that at least in the road infrastructure, improved and more developed perspective.
Public procedures that European aspects are necessary.
However, we have made it clear that this procedures are more complicated.
One of the primary priorities is to encourage them and analyse this.
"We have a lot of remarks, because we should not be more efficient and more optimistic.
The first requirement is to implement a more efficient fiscal management.
Therefore, we will not have more conservative pressure from the situation, because we will not be able to stop the public fiscal management.
SETimes: A debate on the new administration of Romania is under way.
One of these measures is that the EU funds will provide better benefits.
Orthodox: We have observed the lack of a social approach that has been submitted to projects with one of the different communities.
At the same time, we have repeatedly repeatedly repeated a connection between projects that have been used in the province.
Many public companies could lead to a legal approach to the region, and it could help the facilitate these priorities that are financed by EU funds.
The project, due to uncertainty, has taken place after a new road infrastructure project that needs to be built.
Among the most different interests, there are more visa-free and electoral options, and such as such as such as this agreement is not reached.
As a result, we are able to resume the financing of projects that have not been implemented in time.
Serbia ’ s electoral priority for IMF
The first primary factor under the IMF stand-by arrangement was unresolved.
However, the ruling coalition is not responding to the questionnaire: What will the parties' financial resources?

The IMF delegation, headed by Mark Allin, who visited the country earlier this month, was part of the first factory in the Belgrade delegation on October 29th as part of a 1.2 billion euro stand-by stand-by stand-by arrangement.
Everything is good.
The agreement is being implemented, and Serbia &aposs banking system is stable.
With a good exhibition between the leaders of the Central Bank of Serbia and the crisis, inflation is under control of public spending.
The IMF Movement has repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly voiced confidence that the budget in Serbia will be slowed by 4.5% of GDP this year.
Serbia is satisfied with the ratification of a higher deficit of 3.9% in talks only three months ago.
This is a "25m euros" for the disappointment of Serbia.
Therefore, Serbian Central Bank (NBS) Director Ana Giorgojevic said that this money will be used to be used in the economy, but Serbia will be used for the first loan of 100m euros in December.
According to NBS analysts, Serbia is now closer to such a situation.
Inflation has been dropped since May, and the 14.7% dropped to 8.7% year-on-year in October.
The Central Bank is hoping that the 1.5% target for 2011 will be held in the first quarter of 2012.
The problem is still high: the success of agriculture facility and the state will continue to be able to raise the prices of electricity, gas services, basic services and prices of food products.
The current inflation rate is encouraging.
This trend allows the NBS to reduce its main policy rate since the beginning of last year (2.5 per cent).
Meanwhile, industrial production is not doing many of its optimism.
Everything in the World market is being sparked by social pressure, due to the reduction of Serbian products in the EU, due to the reduction of their products.
This year, the economic growth is limited to 2%, but it is expected to drop to 1.5% next year.
"The move is reducing imports, and this would mean that the crisis in the production of production," Vladimir Vukcevic, director of the high economy tennis and Travel (MAT), told SETimes.
"The optimism is optimistic, and industrial growth will be held at 1%."
A major concern is that US Steel will close its second explosion in Smederevo.
The first opportunity was in six months.
The company, the largest exports of Serbia, is responsible for the first nine months of this year, with about 16.5% of the total exports of Serbia.
In a country that is about 22% of unemployment, this company is working for 50,000 workers.
The IMF mission, Allin, noted a key issue: public spending is likely to affect politicians due to the parliamentary elections.
The government said it plans to improve the tax deficit, improve the profit of public organisations and increase the impact on public subsidies.
However, the success will be completely unlikely to continue foreign debt.
"The current interest of 7.25% of the state is expensive for a country that is 1.5% of GDP growth," economist Miroslav Proopijevic told SETimes. "Spain and Italy are the most important EU countries, which are at 1.5% of the annual GDP." Spain and Greece are not a small-term term for Serbia. &
Papandreou said Israel will help improve business relations with the EU.
ATINA, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Thursday (February 10th) that Israel will help boost economic relations and co-operation with EU member states.
"This will be important for the Israel economy, not only for strategic security," Papandreou said after meeting with representatives of the United States in Athens.
Greece wants to co-operate with Israel and defence areas, he said. (Nafet Eleftheria - 10 / 02 / 11)
World Bank warns influence of population
The countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have warned on Wednesday that the countries of the Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union must reform in the long term.
(World Bank, AP, DPA, RFE / RL, Sofia News Agency - 20 / 06 / 07)
One of the 65 people in 2005 will be more than 65, the World Bank reported on Wednesday (June 20th). [AFP]
The World Bank warned on Wednesday (June 20th) that economic growth in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union could stop if the governments in the region have taken steps to improve the population.
The new report, titled "No Grid: The Education and the former Soviet Union", said that most of the 28 countries in the region will be among the most population in the region by 2005.
About 300,000 papers said the region is expected to reduce the total population in the next two years.
At the same time, people in 65 are higher than 2000.
In nine countries, including Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Bulgaria and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the population will be more than 65 per cent until 2025.
Both reasons for the census and the decrease of the population, as well as the rise of unprecedented reduction and the average salary of the average.
Bulgaria is the second country in Ukraine, which is expected to drop 18% in the next 20 years. The population is expected to drop to 24% of the current population in Ukraine. The population of Romania is likely to decrease by 25%, and the population will likely decrease to 5% in Croatia.
Only eight countries, including Albania, Macedonia and Turkey, will increase in the region over the next 20 years.
In BiH, the rate of 65 is expected to increase by almost two times by 2015.
The report says that more than 65, more than five Bulgarian people will be the largest, and Slovenia will be one of the most popular population in the world.
Soviet Union of Eastern and the former Soviet Union will have to reduce pension spending by government governments.
Another consequence is that people in this group will have to increase health spending to meet their requests for hospitals, hospital and economic development.
The region is also facing the problem, according to the report, which does not complete the poor population and poor market economies.
"France, Italy, Italy and Japan are better than the Eastern Europe and the former Soviet countries in order to fulfil the challenges," said World Bank Director for Human Rights Affairs, one of the preparations.
According to bank experts, the best way to create pressure on pensions is to increase the pension rate in the region, especially in the region, Albania, Romania, Serbia and Turkey.
Another priority is to change social assistance reforms.
"There is no increase in public spending, but it is possible to catch the crowd.
For that time, the number of countries in the region will be sustainable, even if the number of pensions systems in the region can be sustainable, and the precondition for long-term foreign currency financing should be implemented, "he said.
If regional countries are seeking to continue foster growth and meet EU standards, the report said, a strong producer will be a condition for a strong production.
These targets can be implemented in implementing reforms that will bring the financial markets and improve better education and improve the life of life and to improve the living markets.

The Peace Implementation Council (PIC) has expressed concern about the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) during a meeting in Sarajevo earlier this week.
The council, which began a two-day meeting Monday (June 18th), said the country political leaders are responsible for the current situation because they are attacking the attacks and progress.
"Since April 2006, peacekeeping implementation and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) has been completely completed," the board said, the first step towards EU membership.
Contact High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling praised his contributions during his mandate, but criticised the official for allowing the good political situation to stop.

The PIC has been disappointed, especially because of its constitutional reform.
In the latest effort to resume this process, representatives of the main parties have failed to reach an agreement on a solution.
The signing of the SAA with the EU should be the main priority for the country, the PIC reported.
For that reason, police reform and co-operation with The Hague tribunal must be made concrete progress.
PIC members have rejected the latest results that the authority should be extradited by the state level.
The Republika Srpska, led by Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, has threatened to hold a referendum in which the region is weakening its own autonomy.
The Federation of BiH has supported the division of the country &aposs ethnic groups, with the support of BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic.

The fourth round of talks between Belgrade and Pristina will begin on Thursday (May 4th).
The agenda of this tournament is the Mitrovica issue, which has been divided between ethnic communities and has been divided over the years.
As for other key problems in the status talks, the two sides have their optimism on the future of Mitrovica.
The Pristina delegation argues that both municipalities will be responsible for the establishment of a protocol that will be established by a international manager in the coming years.
Serbian negotiators want to become completely different municipalities, including a Serbian municipal group proposed to close relations with northern Mitrovica.
The Kosovo side opposes this approach as an attempt to build ethnic minorities.
The participants described the previous negotiators as unfair and constructive.
Nevertheless, the parties have not been able to make different opinions on Kosovo.
Albert Rohan, the deputy UN envoy for the talks, described it as "unfair".
According to Rohan, Serbs see a major autonomy and the central government for municipalities, while Albanians want a stronger role for the government.
Rohan insisted that the decentralisation should be applied for all municipalities, and that Serbs insist that the ethnic principle should be implemented in all municipalities, while insisting that Serbs are in the majority of the municipalities.

Albanian negotiators say they accept autonomy as a result of a union.
Authorities insist that the municipalities' principles are based on European principles, functioning and sustainable sustainability.
"We have tried to make the final status of the final status, in order to bring all national minorities, including Serbs, the independent and sovereignty of a sovereignty and sovereignty to Kosovo.
The Serbs should have the right to decide on the local level, "he said.
Both sides, meanwhile, have voiced support for the proposed proposal by Rohan and a UN experts.
Kosovo has been under UN mandate since 1999, when the Serb pressure on ethnic Albanians to be implemented by NATO, the province has been forced by the UN since Belgrade had to control the province.
Although Kosovo is part of Serbia, the final status is not yet set.
In April, the Contact Group said the status issue should be resolved by the end of this year and that the solution should be accepted by all citizens.

This is a complete success of the state, intelligence and intelligence. "
British Foreign Minister Jack Straw, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, voiced regret over the massacre of the massacre in Srebrenica, saying he was "one of the most popular European history" since 1945.
"Our international community is a whole way," he said. "I am convinced that we will allow us to see our full observers.
However, it is very happy. "

At the same time, war crimes suspects Karadzic and Mladic are on the list, "he said.

The Albanian Central Election Commission (CEC) announced its first official results Sunday (July 10th), and confirmed his victory by former President Sali Berisha.
Although the Democrats are said to win a clear majority in the country &aposs 140 seats, the government seems to be low by the end of this month.
President Fatmir Nano, leader of the ruling Socialist Party (SP), who has refused to accept the new cabinet, is planning to send consequences in the 30 election law.
The DP has won 55 seats in parliament, with 97 votes in the both seats of the 100-seat election zone.
As the SP has won 40 seats, the Socialist Movement for the Socialist Movement of Prime Minister Ilir Meta has won the seats.
According to Albanian law, 2.5 per cent of the remaining 40 seats will be distributed by the parties' votes in the country.
According to the DP and its allies' ideas, some 73 seats are said to have a majority in the 73 seats, and that the government will allow it to form a institution.
The SP and its ideas will receive a total of 64 seats.
The elections are seen as a serious test of the country &aposs international democracy standards. Since the communist elections in 1990, the elections in Albania have repeatedly shown that all the five elections have been held in Albania since the end of communism in 1990.
More than 400 international electoral observers sent to the election, the OSCE said in the last elections that "international community communities and democratic standards" are not only part of the election standards ".
EU security chief Javier Solana called on authorities to launch an official investigation on national disputes.
The CEC said the final results should investigate 230 complaints from parties and independent candidates.

The government of Nano will continue to resume the country until the election results are documented.

Romania has approved a new law on the National Assistance Agency (ANI), a state-run agency that has authorised politicians and other things, and has approved a new law on EU standards.
The country has criticised the EU for criticism of judicial reforms in a report in July.
"I can see the conclusion as a positive atmosphere," ANI Secretary-General Horia Georgiescu told SETimes after the vote last week. "I believe that the EC report on the judges' latest report on the judiciary is a major impact on the basis."
The ANI was assaulted several months after the constitution 'verdict in April and cancelled some of the previous law enforcement of the office.
As a result, more than 4,000 cases were suspended.
While he entered the unrest, Brussels urged Romania to take action and to implement the law.
"The results of this report are aware of the importance of the political security in the public, as well as the effective results of the interests of Romania," he said on August 24th. On 24 August, parliament adopted the new law with 78-0 votes.
However, the Social Democratic Party of Socialists, however, have triggered optimism.
According to party leader Victor del Ponte, problems with the law enforcement are not resolved.
"We will be optimistic if the Romanian government and the European Commission demands for their demands, we will be optimistic in the vote until the Constitutional Court has decided," del Ponte said.
PSD diplomats participated in the parliamentary session, though they did not vote.
The new law envisions a number of provisions that were removed before.
These include the establishment of the investigative committees of the Constitutional Court and a single presence of the accounts, accounts and property areas.
The law also envisions the requirement for any contract with the state authorities, with public officials.
It is open for both the unrest and the consequences.
Furthermore, the new law allows authorities to investigate three years after their mandate.
The bill is now seeking President Traian Basescu to sign.
"The most important achievements and diseases are still open, and the Romanian president is still open to the public, and it is a lot of challenges in the fight against public procurement of state financing contractors that have to be financed by state businessmen.
He added that ANI expects the law.
Those who were dismissed by the tribunal earlier this month, they will be removed to cope with each other.
"All these investigations must be completed," he said. "The two years of work has been held.
Many investigations will be discovered because they are limited to three years. "

Since then, Wild Boars won the semi-national championship.
He told SETimes that one of the team is created for the personal winner to win a or two seats.
"It will be the last stage of the athletes and athletes, as a part of our actors and governance, and the stage of athletes," Gajic said.
Wild Boars helped the development of the players in early years and helped them to play an unprecedented football player.
Young places the first team, the team has been screened by ten young players since 2009.
Aleksandar Simic, the first player of the team, is "Al-".
According to him, the American football team needs to improve the performance of the season and historical performance.
"We are aware of the principles of this principles and this is why we are the best," Rajic said. In the 2009 season, he won more than 1,000.
Mostar Diz, a founder of the three Americans, told SETimes that Rajic is doing the share of the winner in this year.
"All players are among them.
"It is a real athlete of the team."
The management is confident that the team will continue its success.
"There is no longer a couple in a couple," Vice President Nemanja Djokja told SETimes in an interview with SETimes.

"We need to find a consensus, because we are still not able to win the five national championship," he said.
The new US players and agriculture are seeking to win the EFF championship.
Kragujevac, owner of Wild Boars', supported the team since the beginning of the 120km south of Belgrade.
Furthermore, Kragujevac Mayor Veroljub Stevanovic pledged to continue support financial and logistics, and vowed to build two new reconstruction.

The trial, which began in April 16th 2007, was submitted to 64 witnesses, and was submitted to 15,000 proceedings.
Addressing the prosecutors' closure, he asked Boskovski to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.

The prosecution claims that the prosecution "usually use the spokesperson" and allegedly claimed that any of the crimes have been involved.
The defendants are Macedonian citizens, who are charged with the tribunal for violating war crimes.
Prosecutors claim they did not prove that the two were responsible in the case.
The legal representative of Boskovski, Edina Rasmusic, said the former interior minister is not a statement that he is attacking the attack or has a direct influence on military soldiers in Ljuboda.
Radisovic said that Boskovski has taken legal measures to investigate the judiciary, as well as investigating an interior ministry commission and co-operate with police officers.

Balkan countries, the United States and the EU welcomed Monday (May 12th) the outcome of the parliamentary elections in Serbia, which the Democratic Party (DS), led by President Boris Tadic.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic emphasised that the victory of the "European coalition for Serbia" is very happy for the future of the region.
"The outcome of the elections is showing that there will have a neighbouring country where many people are not focused on the past," Mesic said.
Officials in other Balkan countries, including Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo, celebrated Mesic 'remarks, celebrating the outcome of the most important elections in Serbia since President Slobodan Milosevic took over the regime in October 2000.
Tadic was a surprised victory in Sunday &aposs election elections, because the coalition was shown by the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) in the polls.
A European electoral commission said on Monday that the vote would replace 38.4% of the votes in Serbia and will replace 102 seats in parliament.
It is SRS with 29.6% and 77 seats.
The Western governments and high-level EU officials have praised Serbian voters for their support for European membership.
"Serbian voters have a clear system in Europe," the US embassy in Belgrade said on Monday.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn celebrated the success of the 27-nation bloc, saying that Brussels is ready to support further progress in the accession process.
"The European Commission welcomes the success of reforms," Rehn said. "The EU is preparing to speed up the EU rotating strategy, including membership candidate status," and other EU officials called for a meeting of the new cabinet.
"I hope that a new government will soon be formed soon to meet the requirements for implementing reforms and continuing progress towards Europe," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Monday.
However, Tadic 'coalition does not provide a majority of 126 seats, and both coalition partners.
The four.6% of the vote -- the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), led by the former Milosevic, is considered a result of the results.
The coalition between Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and the New Serbia Democratic Party of Serbia is ready to participate in a coalition government, with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who won 11.59% of votes in parliament, said it is ready to participate in a coalition government.
SRS leader Tomislav Nikolic met with Kostunica on Monday to form a joint cabinet.
The two parties will have a majority of 127 seats with SPS seats.
Observers are unacceptable to a coalition between Tadic and Kostunica, as the majority of EU member states' dispute over the country 'EU membership bid were unacceptable.
Therefore, the president will need some of the Socialists and ethnic coalition. The 5.24% vote and the pro-Western Liberal Democratic Party, Cedomir Jovanovic, who won 13 seats in parliament, is opposed to form the pro-Western Liberal Democratic Party.
Bank Urges Greek Government for Economic Affairs
The Greek government faces a strike of financial challenges from the EU and public sector employees.
Meanwhile, elections are approaching.
By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 25 / 11 / 03
In a letter to Greek Governor Nicholas Garas Simitis, the Bank 'Director for Reconstruction voiced concern that Olympic expenditures, expensive budget deficit and new social aid, and warns that Greece' next government would be a huge tender.
According to Garas, the budget deficit will not allow public debt to ensure that the public debt is slowly slowed, and the inflation rate of competitiveness will be slow.
The inflation of 3.6 per cent in 2003 will be 1.5 per cent, he noted.
The financial deficit in the public sector in the first eight months of this year has reached 5.5 per cent of GDP, the central bank said.
The figure, which was 2.6 per cent of GDP last year, is expected to increase more than two participants.
The government 'deficit rose from 1.9 per cent to 4.6 per cent last year.
Economic and finance ministers are at the same level.
In addition to a lot of citizens, the rise in the surveillance shows that Greece has returned to a step in the financial administration.
Finance Minister Nikola Kodoulakis' rejection of strikes, university students, police officers and nurses, as well as financial concerns, as well as the government has refused to raise more than the EU.
The upcoming elections are not applied for the ruling PASOK party, but the financial crisis is also a time that all personnel are trying to help more social assistance in the public sector.
In the public polls, Christofias, whose PASOK is at least 5 per cent of the opposition, has already been able to find a solution to the financial problem.
However, there is no chance that the ministry will not be allowed for growth.
The reason for the restructuring of criticism is the reason for the removal of the opposition party and the opposition New Democracy.
Opposition economy spokesperson George Alokoufis criticised the government 'efforts to sell the Post Protection Bank, saying the process is not transparent.
Alogoskoufis also charged that the 2004 budget was submitted to parliament on 6 October.
The government could be able to produce an official transportation from the EU, due to the current budget deficit of 3 per cent of GDP.
Greece could have a little time because the Eurostat explosion has been removed in the past few months, and it is not part of this rise in Germany and France.
Do you think there is no lack of economic growth?
We say that economic growth is completely completed with political stability.
According to former Romanian Finance Minister and economist Daniel Daianu, this is not enough.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 06 / 11 / 06
One of the demonstrations in the town of Budapest in October, Hungary has been sparked by the radical mobile model, as well as the police to control.
Political scenarios in new EU member countries have been surprised by many observers. [Getty Images]
The latest developments in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland are concerned about the world ".
Nevertheless, what is a consequence of concern after the political participation in the EU?
After the accession process, the government and the parties that have a democratic change in the process are part of the parties that have no complaints with the union, and in Hungary, the political changes in this political scenario are caused in public opinion.
Several developments are surprised.
The countries, however, are part of the symbolic part of Europe, and the annual economic growth is greater than in many countries in the EU, and also benefit from 5-2 per cent to 2 per cent.
The overall overall overall economy and economically, he says, is a greater chance of social stability and social politics in countries.
The move should be supported by concrete economic growth in the Middle East over the past decade, and the largest part of the population has been supported by concrete economic growth.
At the same time, it was expected to strengthen the principles of young liberal democracy.
There is no effect that should be taken.
The citizens of the former communist countries, including Portugal and Spain (EU-15), have lived in a strong economic system.
Therefore, these people are expected to facilitate better facilitating democracy and cheaper nationalists, or in the scandal.
Today, the democratic life is believed to be more effective in the countries who have been abandoned for years.
In addition, economic growth is the basic factors and a debate between democracy and democracy.
Opposition argues that even even serious discrimination between the communities, growth is doing everything before.
Experts say the sustainable economic growth should not be reduced, the social environment and a lack of public financing.
Both public sector and private sector practices, as well as an effective fight against corruption.
Following Communist (Central Europe), high growth rates are not enough for a social and political life.
Most citizens in the Middle East and Eastern Europe can be said that the disappointment of the disappointment of citizens who live with economic growth is in the second phase of economic growth, and the centre-right parties are said to have lost the political basis of political parties.
Economists continue to discuss good relationship between democracy and corruption. [Getty Images]
If the EU supports its accession, this force is possible to say that it is more effective in the period that the countries are hoping to join the bloc.
This would mean politicians that have different ideological ideologies, the citizens "return to Europe".
Most of the citizens "returned", the economic benefits will start, and a society meant to achieve.
Since May 2004, people say there is no positive improvement in any issues, but that efforts to ensure that their efforts to implement EU organisations have been more difficult.
A call for the move was uneasy.
This is more than the "economic heritage" in the main members of the EU, and the Games were convinced with psychologists that the EU has been applied for candidate countries.
Middle East European countries have stressed that the Union has made several markets -- especially in the financial and functioning of the Union -- for example, financing services and public services.
Eastern European countries have been more liberalised, according to Western European countries.
While the EU has said they are not doing each other, there is no disappointment that some political circumstances in the Middle Eastern Europe live.
So, the Western economic nationalism has caused economic nationalism in Egypt.
Among other issues such as Germany and Russia, such as Germany and Russia, where Poland are working on a very precedent issue.
People agree to benefit from political freedom and disappointed disappointments.
However, there is a lot of facilitating how the lives are.
The young people who have no personal experience on the communist era cannot know how it is.
They are aware of the referendum, and some young people in the Western Balkans have a news agency that will be able to participate in the second world war and Nazians.
The real democracy in the books is aware of each other.
It is a bad function of democracy, amendment and judiciary forces.
The real situation of the Democracy is the basis of political leaders' values and responsibility, which could be celebrated in some circumstances.
According to some, there is a democracy problem in EU member states, and there is no real state and real state.
"There is no" in the new Europe ", not only a few months ago and psychologically, but this is a reflection of such as psychologists or psychological psychologists.
The high level of interest in Eastern European countries is quite smaller than EU members.
Among other Western European countries, they are facing structural problems, such as the overall system, transportation system, identification of identity and rising pressure.
A lot of economic growth is not a huge way.
Governments are not willing to show the capacity of modernising social problems in the world, but political reactions are not facing with high economic growth rates.
There is no way to resolve these problems, and politicians expect a serious test in the coming years.
The steps will be affected by the country ’ s policy and the economy.
Furthermore, there is a warrant for the Balkans.
In all Southeast European countries, all prospects and disappointed disappointment are the transition of liberal economy.
The economic problems such as unemployment in the region are being claimed. "The EU has become an extraordinary division for some regional countries.
In these countries, the current pressure on instability in Central Europe, but there is no need for further progress in their routes.

(Office of the High Representative, DPA - 19 / 10 / 07; Fena, Office of the High Representative - 18 / 10 / 07)
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak [OHR]
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Friday (October 19th) that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has taken a series of measures aimed at ensuring the "system" and to boost the functioning of state institutions.
Following the measures as the first step towards this goal, Lajcak called on the BiH Council of Ministers and the state parliament to bring changes to the Law on the functioning of both parliament, as well as measures to improve co-operation with the ruling coalition.
If Bosnian politicians are not implemented by December 1st, the amendments to the proposed amendments have not been implemented, he said, there is no other reason for sanctions against them.
The proposed measures aim to facilitate the government and parliament to facilitate the mechanism and eliminate the obstacles facing laws.
The government will allow some members to make decisions if they want to obtain a specific decision, even if they want to join a meeting in the past.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is very clear that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not operational.
"The international community is not a normal state," the country said. "The aim of the international community is to change it.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we have not completed our mandate without changes to the democratic, democratic, a multiethnic society. "
The best way to achieve this goal is to be European integration, but Bosnian politicians are opposed to a deal on police reform, saying that they have not reached an agreement on police reform that the EU is necessary.
"The politicians [are] unprepared], and they will not make it clear and will not move forward on European path," Lajcak said on Thursday. "Everything was signed by all sides in a solution to the European principles of police reform.
In addition, the necessary agreement is not possible, although it has been known and voluntary remarks, but it is not possible to be done today, "he said.
The EU has made it clear until 15 October to reach an agreement on Bosnian politicians to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the 27-nation bloc by the end of this year.
Following the leaders' failure to fulfil this requirement, the first step towards eventual EU membership could be reached at least a year.
"If there is no need to move forward towards European integration -- this is not ready," Lajcak said. "Even though European integration is ready and is expected to decide whether local politicians decide to make it easy."
However, the international community is the responsibility for strengthening the Balkan country, as well as a new approach to transforming a stable, stable and democratic country.
"If the agreements are not done and resolved, Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions are facing work.
They are not given the laws, "Lajcak said, noting that only three reforms have been implemented in the past 12 months.
There are only a recognition of a recognition of EU membership.
"I think that the current situation is now questioning that we will not be able to enter the EU, but it is questionable that we will have the people who will take time," the chief international envoy said. "Today [these measures] are not the question of responsibility or responsibility.
"The only people who believe that this country can be able to feel itself in dangerous."

On Tuesday (February 12th), Turkish authorities criticised Turkish journalist Hrant Dink on the assassination of his plan to respond to the request for a full comprehensive investigation that would enhance any role in justice.
Furthermore, observers began the trial against 19 people indicted for the murder of the 19 people in Istanbul and Armenian journalists, including the Centre of Agos, in Istanbul, and began the start of a two-week trial against the murder of the editor-in-intelligence director.
"We are supporting our full support for the judiciary to urge the mandate in this case," Paris media observers said on Tuesday. "We are confident that there is no need for the necessary conditions for the reality.
In these requirements, we are suspected that the judges will continue to take responsibility and crime as the first and final, "he said.
Dodik, 53, was killed in front of the newspapers' office in January 19th 2007.
In July 2006, about 1.5 million Armenians were sentenced to six months in prison for a "genocide", which was described as a "genocide" by the World War II.

All of these points should be focused on this case, or there will be a lot of resources that Turkey will be in its image. "
Judiciary and judicial independence for Macedonia
The reforms in the judiciary system for Macedonia to fulfil EU and NATO membership requirements are needed to show a serious and serious interest in the judiciary.
By Goran Trajkov for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 13 / 02 / 08
EU and NATO membership are on judicial reform. [SE Times]
The judiciary reform is one of the main challenges Macedonia must take part in NATO and EU membership efforts.
Another problem is the independence of the courts and the judiciary.
In Macedonia, the most consequences of the consequence of six months are under way for more than ten years.
According to the constitution, however, the judges are likely to have direct political influence on electoral elections.
"The State Council of Ministers should be made by the judges [to] elected by the judges," said Renata Supka.
"The political parties in parliament must be aware of this process, not only because of the European integration prospects, but the Macedonian citizens' independent judges and insufficient political process," Supka said. "The political parties need to find a more consensus for the interests of the citizens and constitutional changes."
The judiciary is a key factor for the education of people working in the judiciary.
While the country is on its path to membership, the judiciary will serve as a mandate for European and international law enforcement.
The new organised crime judges will be called to build a more efficient system.
It must be enough education to do so.
According to experts in the courts, reforms will be very simply.
The Constitutional judiciary will focus on amendments in the constitutional system, ensuring funds and authority, and the last mandate to implement "constitutional consensus" as a result of the rights of people in the court.
Experts say reforms will be done before.
The closure of Macedonia &aposs EU membership is open, but could not be open until the end.

Since Bulgaria joined the EU in January 2007, media freedom in the country has declined, the international media report said on Thursday (February 5th).
"Organised crime groups have improved their rights on the media," said the Centre for Independent Journalists (SG) in Paris.
Bulgaria was ranked 59th in the highest level of EU member states, with the latest annual press freedom of expression.
Since 2006, the country has dropped 24 minutes.
A 14-page page report on the country &ap91-page media has been prepared after a number of unrest in 2008.
In April, George Stoev, a expert in organised crime, was killed in Sofia.
Oman Stefan Stefanov, director of the Frogg News website in September, was removed in three days.
At the same time, the State Security Agency (DANS) found that a number of lawmakers and journalists were discovered.
According to the SG, corruption and news agency showed that the corruption and the trafficking of the 1990s has been increasingly reduced by violence, but Stochev and Stefanov are still facing the violence.
"Some journalists continue to stop their own own, while others continue to send pressure from the world and political environmental environment," the Mediterranean observer said.
He added that the murder and Stefanov were "reminded to the risks of these risks" for those who say the incidents are in place.
In addition, the SG has not been implemented as a result of a 1998 law that enforcement members of the communist National Security Force in the media.
The group also noted that the official Bulgarian Journalists' Union has a little restaurant and that journalists are part of the law as a major paper.
For instance, some conservative consultations are "unacceptable" because the journalist does not respect a more respect, or not a successful message.
According to the group, journalists of the country live in the two levels of press freedom, they have more competitiveness from their colleagues in the city of Sofia, while local officials are not optimistic to journalism.
Asian Yordanov, a newspaper journalist, told SG that the situation was in the last 15 years.
According to Yordanov, the most patient issue has been corruption on high-ranking officials from the judiciary or interior ministry.
"However, the number of issues [are increasing] the new architectural community," said Yordanov, who is on the austerity and physical attacks.
The European parliament in June said the June elections will focus on Bulgarian authorities' decisions to ensure that journalists do their freedom.

Serbian fans have been a significant increase in the euro after Russian Gazprom announced that Serbia will pay 51% stake in the national oil company (NIS). On Friday (February 6th), 99.1 euros were sold, while all the lowest rates against 9.3% on January 28th.
No one in Serbia expects Russia to remove its power in the first day of 2009, and 8.6 euros have been removed in the first day of 2009.
Experts expect the decrease -- from October 1st to October 1st -- more than 240% in the euro.
The Turkish Cypriots, the second largest money in the region, dropped by 17% in the same period.
Serbian experts have been divided over the truth.
The optimism expects to climate between 90 and 95 to 95 per cent of the euro, while fears fear that the foreign currency books are low than 150 euros in accordance with exports.
The six-hour board is created by Serbian citizens, companies and the government.
Serbia, such as other Southeast European countries, is increasingly high inflation.
In addition, inflation expects to increase the prices of companies, which are importing imports.
Recent consumers, who have been paying a biometric loan, need to win more clients.
In addition to the commissioners, there is no easy service for the basic macroeconomic control of Serbia.
The lack of foreign investment and the trade deficit of 8.2 billion euros in 2008 is the country 'current account deficit.
The central bank in Serbia is seeking to pay its foreign debt.
Even though the Gazprom 'balance, the bank has no need to pay foreign debt and promote the liquidity.
The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has sold 1.2 billion euros in 2008, while it has no effect since 2009.
Furthermore, the NBS has lost the interest rates that have been used to buy other weapons, purchased by the banks that have been used to buy the value.
The NBS has been reduced, and no longer had no chance to sell the banks' bonds.
NBS Director Radovan Jelasic said the bank will not continue to defend the army.
"These intervention revenues, the planned privatisation revenues, the planned responsibility for the government, are removing new loans from foreign investment or abroad," Jelasic said.
NBS warns that the climate is a serious surprise in the economy and the need to end the money that Belgrade has no money.
The budget deficits, budget deficits, foreign investments and exports -- will be a increase in the quality of exports -- the bank says.

Since this month, EU citizens will have the same opportunities for Croatian nationals, which are sold in Croatia.
The restructuring was needed to deal with long-term strategic procedures, such as the foreign and justice ministers of EU citizens to purchase for years, as well as the number of legal conditions.
Following this month, Croatia has fulfilled a requirement for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with EU citizens to sell equal rights in Croatia.
However, the new austerity is not part of cultural and national units.
Officials from the EU are not forced to buy their citizens from foreign and justice ministers.
Despite the opportunity for the past few years, prices and the global economic crisis have started, observers expect to continue in the sale of sales for foreign tourists.
Authorities see Croatia as a long-term and long-term document.
The restructuring was needed to allow a foreign minister to buy special refugees, to be removed from the two ministers.
At least 98% of the indicators were slow, but the process has been slowly slowly, and more than two years.
Another problem is that the government has been under a clear name for a few years, because it is a priority.
Currently, it can be done on the internet.
According to the Croatian Economic Committee, more than 3,500 foreign currency have been allowed to buy over the past decade.
In this field, Germany (2,000) are the main figures, while Austrians (700), Hungarians (120) and Britain are on the rise.
Among them, foreign tourists, Dalmatia and flexibility, are willing to get Iceland.
While official figures are not true, more than 70,000 foreign donors have reportedly been able to get a special boycott in Croatia, which is not needed to provide a special company or a private company.
In an exclusive interview with the Zagreb Economic Institute, Marusa Visitak, the foreign ministry said that the foreign ministry has demanded that it would not change after "the prices of visa liberalisation", as the foreign currency prices for foreign nationalists "in accordance with the Croatian coastal market.

The minority government of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica needs the secret support of the Socialists to stay in power.
According to the opposition indictment, this support could be removed against the members of the Milosevic family.

Opposition politicians in Serbia have responded to the arrest of Slobodan Milosevic last week, charging that the move was part of the agreement with Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The reduction of charges against Milosevic is a result of the Serbian Socialist Party (SPS) with the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS)," Serbian President Boris Tadic (DS) official Aleksandar Vlahovic said in an interview with the Belgrade daily Blic on Monday (August 15th).
The ruling coalition, led by Milosevic, needs "unfair support" by the SPS.
Several months ago, the legal charges against Milosevic were said to be a political step towards the rest of Mira.
Marko Milosevic, who is believed to be hiding in Russia, was sentenced to six months in prison for the Otppa movement against the regime in Poevac, who was dismissed by his family.
Earlier this month, however, Zoran Milovanovic resigned.
Following that, all legal charges against the former Yugoslav leader were removed.
Milovanovic [resignation] came after a letter to Kostunica and Tadic, who said his family had no threats to the death and that it is no longer on that.
On Friday, Tadic urged Republika Srpska Prosecutor Slobodan Jankovic to monitor law enforcement and issued an open report.
Jankovic returned to the summer holidays on Monday.
Nenad Konstantinovic, a member of the DC board, said that Jankovic [party] should respond to the questions of the questions, and that he should not be formed with justice minister and other officials.
Constantinovic said he would ask the party to resign of the prosecutor if he did not do so.
"It is not applied for Marko Milosevic and Mira Markovic, who is applied for others," the Belgrade-based Radio B92 quoted Konstantinovic as saying on Friday.
Local media say the aim of these developments is to facilitate a meeting with Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague.
Meanwhile, Serbian Investment Minister Velimir Ilic, meanwhile, claimed allegations that the case was intervened.
He said he has recommended Milovanovic to "ask" the former Yugoslav president ".
"I think that Milovanovic is hiding, arrest.

Montenegro is seeking to increase the District Investment Investment in 2005, after the undisappointed figures this year.

Djurovic said that authorities are aiming potential investors in the global competitiveness will need to work to promote Montenegro through the campaign and bilateral negotiations.
Many international experts believe the FDI will start reducing in 2006 and 2007.
This year, a Investment Agency was established.
The agency is expected to play a crucial role in privatisation, especially as the state telecom and distribution factory.
The FDI is an important way to increase production, reducing unemployment, improving infrastructure and increase living standards.
Despite the privatisation process, Serbia-Montenegro and other Balkan countries -- such as Poland and and the Czech Republic -- officials have expressed their commitment to the situation in small markets and transit markets.
International demonstrations show that Serbia-Montenegro is not a major investment rating.
Among countries in the region, Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania are on the ground.
In response to this question, Podgorica has been consulting foreign advisers to assess possible investment and development.
In a recent report by the Foreign Investment Agency (DHR), the State Investment Agency (DDD) stressed that the government has taken some challenges facing the FDI.
In addition to a smaller market and interim transition period, the republics in the republic are undermining the lack of weaknesses in the management system, macroeconomic instability and corruption.
However, DDOD experts also noted that a good geographical consortium that has Montenegro has a good geography, economic reforms, widespread labour and widespread privatisation.
According to the DID, the potential for Montenegro should be fully recognised by the government activities.
According to Djurovic, the government must prepare a long-term plan and a clear strategy that will use this potential.

A majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) citizens, which have been disappointed by the 1992-1995 conflict, have been convinced by nationalist and corruption, are convinced that the Berlin District was disappointed.
"Some of the communist Yugoslavia has been discovered with the Berlin Wall," Sarajevo legal professor Zdravko Grebo told SETimes.
The political reforms in 1965 have caused a lot of market economies, and this is allowing Yugoslav citizens to visa liberalisation, Grebo said.
This system was pressure and tensions.
They have strong social protection, intelligence and parallel training and health services.
"The other communist countries in Europe are aware of the difference.
However, the Berlin District has no positive difference. "
Although Bucharest has changed Europe, it was not a major news conference in BiH.
"However, the new obstacles have started to find new obstacles," he said.
Sarajevo has been under way for more than three years, and BiH citizens are still facing visa liberalisation in Europe, "he added.
He says he is difficult to say that more freedom and freedom of expression from the former Yugoslavia is not difficult.
"There is no media and freedom of expression in Yugoslavia.
So far, many parties have a political system, judiciary and media independence, but more guarantees for the majority of the public, cultural, cultural and education.
"The situation is a disaster of human rights."
Zdravko Prlenda, 66, recognises the last 20 years as "human society".
He says the state has provided a team of young people and is more safe.
While no communist party is not a member of the communist party, he said, one should have to "have to be the communist," in accordance with the weapons or political ".
"We have more crime, corruption and unemployment in BiH.
"There is no chance that people are in the past."
Hajin Arific, 62, says the expectations for the communist isolation have not been completed in BiH.
Arific believes that Yugoslavia is not part of the island, the EU and NATO will be the first Eastern European country.
"We have no longer freedom of movement for visa-free movement, a peaceful state and a developed economy. [We have no] policy, freedom, freedom of movement and uncertainty.
"Everything of the French State Department has shown the success in BiH," he said.
"I think that the Berlin Darch was the last gold in BiH," he said, "I think that the process was sparked by all swimming."

EU foreign ministers will decide whether Macedonia will start negotiations next year. [EU]
Greek leaders welcomed Tuesday (December 8th) the EU foreign ministers' decision on Macedonia 'accession talks.
Greece must resolve the name dispute between the first two countries, Alternal Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas said.
"There is no way to start negotiations without a solution," Droutsas said, adding that Greece is ready to help its accession process in a solution to the long-term problem.
To avoid a final vote from Greece, EU ministers agreed to discuss the issue in the first half of 2010 that Spain will take over the rotating EU presidency.
The head of the post, Swedish, has submitted a draft proposal for the start of a date, but did not reach a compromise in Athens.
The Skopje decision was not delay.
Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said the decision was nothing else than in the NATO summit in Bucharest last April, when Greece faces Macedonia 'bid to join NATO.
He stressed that open problems between the two countries will not be resolved and unresolved.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki described the outcome of the EU meeting Tuesday as "a new chapter of Greece".
A group of students at the Academy and Methodius University in Skopje announced plans to protest a protest in front of the EU representative Wednesday.
According to European Parliament member Edard Kukan, the new Greek government is on the way to provide participation.
"If the new Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou has not made progress in the administration, I do not know how we can solve the name issue," Kukan said.
Kukan, the head of the European Parliament for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo, cautioned the name dispute against nationalism.
He noted that the government has a very strong public support.
"This can be used in two directors: I am confident to approve the name dispute, and the smaller political decisions to ratify their nationalism," Kukan said.
Last week, Gruevski met with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to discuss the situation.
Barroso said he believes that a real solution is possible and that both countries should show political will.
"EU membership is the most important target of our foreign policy, with NATO membership," he said.
He said the latest direct talks with Papandreou have been in a positive airport, but no concrete results.
"There is a dialogue, but we have no serious progress [on the issue]," he said.

Serbian Conservatives Support of Milosevic 'Party
One of the conservative parties have returned to the Socialists of Milosevic, as the government in Serbia failed to block the negotiations.
(AP, Reuters, Scotsman, Telegraph, Radio B92, RFE / RL - 02 / 02 / 04)
The Serbian Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) is expected to decide on Tuesday (February 4th) to support the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) candidate in the parliamentary elections on Wednesday.
The conservative DSS, which won four democratic parties in December, has been the most powerful party in the December elections, has entered the Socialists' support for a new government talks over the past few weeks.
Following talks with the DSS on Monday, the leaders of the "national interests", the SPS leaders said that the suspected war crimes suspect Slobodan Milosevic will support the candidate of parliament.
However, a SPS official said the issue is likely to be formed by the DSS leader Vojislav Kostunica.
"We cannot support a political platform against the values that are represented by the SPS," said Ivica Dacic, head of the party &aposs central committee.
According to SPS member Milorad Vucelic, the party would require the privatisation process and allow Serbian citizens to send to The Hague.
DS leader Dejan Mihajlov, who confirmed the Socialists' consultations with the Socialists, said the talks "were done and will be done".
In response, he said, four political forces in the democratic bloc will not continue talks with the Democratic Party (DS) and coalition talks.
The DSS, the DS, G17 Plus and the Serbian Renewal Movement for Renewal Movement (SPOS), has provided 146 seats in parliament. The DSS, 53, and the DSS has represented the largest party in parliament.
The party was the second after the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), led by war crimes suspect Vojislav Seselj.
The Socialists of Milosevic have 22 seats in the SRS.
The coalition talks between the four parties in the bloc have been made with many consequences.
The DS, who played his role in the last government, has been supported by Dragan Maricanin. The DS and the SPS were elected as president of the parliamentary session on January 27th, because the DS and SPS did not participate in the parliamentary session.
The DS also opposed a proposal for the government to start work before the three other democracy parties' work, and the government proposed a solution.
The party insisted that the process is resolving all institutional issues.
Following the success of the negotiations, the DS said it would not support a minority government, which will win 37 seats in parliament.
The DS condemned the support of the DSS Socialists, and said the SPS will not participate in a coalition, including the SPS.
"We will not take part in a government with the Democratic Party and democracies, but we will not be able to form a government," DS leader Boris Tadic said on Sunday.
A day later, Radio B92 reported that Tadic, G17 Plus, SP-NS and the SPS coalition, warning that democratic parties will return to the Milosevic regime before October 2000.
A coalition government, the SPS, will not happen in the West, calling for a coalition in the bloc.
On Monday, the SRS issued a declaration demanding that the government would be formed or be formed as soon as possible.

"There is no reason that businessmen are being taken, but only the importance of measures.
However, the situation is not affected by the consumption, "Kataksiis said." It is very big unemployment.
"If the IMF wants the measures are taken, it is not important in two months."
Katakiakis said that the medics -- especially the businesses and owners -- are still frozen from their jobs, and most of the operations are crucial to the restructuring of commercial currency.
If the prices are convinced, VAT rates -- will have 23% to the proposed bailout plan -- have not reflected by businesses and not reflected.
Stefanos Lekatris is a unique book and a number of women in Athens, Patras and western Athens.
Another reason that the government and politicians should not be able to "avoid terrorism and panic", he said.
"It is very important that the trade and investors should be taken, but the process is death," he told SETimes.
In the first three months of this year, the businessman said it was successful to increase revenues from the same period in 2009, but could decide to participate.
However, the rise of a 12% increase in the rise was too much, while the Paspian holidays increased their sales in March.
"The primary effort is the high level of revenues," he said.
Lekatris, Italy, France and Britain, cautioned that "victims" are not low.
At the same time, smaller victims have frozen with a large rise.
Despite the crisis, however, Lekatal has not been actually legal, but did not increase its loans.
Ian Gourley, head of the Greek Iranian Business Association, said the decisions are "not enough" if the decisions were taken, but not the need to be taken ".
Gournaly, who has been pushing for the Greek exports to find at least one measures that will be affected, noted the implementation of a electronic customs system.
Gourley said on 1 April that both in Greece and Poland were on the EU to the internet.
The IMF package for Romania two years ago has created spending on the economic crisis, he said.
The same should be used to help Greece, he said.
"We have a positive atmosphere in Romania," he said.

One of the obstacles to the economic growth of Albania was the presence of a major losses.
According to the IMF, the economic activities in the country are up to 50 per cent.
Albanian Central Bank officials, meanwhile, say that the money in Albania has been split by 26 per cent of the banking system. In the past decades, it is still high in international standards.
"This is a result of the lack of information on the banking system and is linked to economic and financial crime," said Bank Governor Fatmir Ibrahi.
The government is seeking to reduce unrest economic activities as part of efforts to build a more financial system.
One of these measures is to allow public employees to pay their salaries.
In June 2004, the Central Bank of Albania launched a pilot project to promote salaries by banks.
Authorities are now planning to distribt the salaries of about 10,000 officers working in state administration.
These banks are participating in a smaller market, which aims to promote the public, reduction of new commissions, reduction of the commissions, ATM churches and other services.
Most banks are submitted to services through the bank accounts.
Under the new initiative, the government will pay the mobile phone, electricity and water bills.
The banking system is expected to create a significant impact on the banking system.
Several researchers, banks and operations are still low, according to a number of researchers by BoA.
However, the situation is likely to be changed, as many people are trying to make their salaries as a result of their salaries.
Fiat of Fiat 'Progress, Serbia' Tato Investment Report
Zastava, the problem of Serbia &aposs major car producer, was a hour in August after Italian Fiat accepted 72.5 per cent of its debt.
Nevertheless, the future of the former Yugoslav secret leader is concerned.

Since the end of the 1980s, the former American project has been installed by plans to revive Zastava, a former leader of Serbia.
Despite any election campaign, the governments have not failed to rescue a rescue of state debt and expenditures.
In September, the municipality campaign was not different: only a few days ago, municipal candidate Zastava promised to send its debt to the state.
However, the stock producer was one of the largest debt in recent months.
In August, Italian Fiat acknowledged that the 41.5m-euro debt of the Kragujevac company has obtained an obstacle to strategic partnership.
According to a deal signed by the Paris Club of the countries' debt to Serbia-Montenegro, Zastava is planning to pay 11.5m euros to the remaining 11.5m euros.
According to Serbian International Economic Relations Minister Predrag Bubraso, who holds a two-month talks, the state will not ask other aspirations to Zastava.
"We will help the resources that will be able to sell some part of the companies and to pay their debt," he said.
Do you expect Serbia to become the only biography producer?
It is difficult to say.
The exercise came more than two years after the government discovered the Zastava Dutch Holding and discovered all over 20 companies from weapons.
Although the state has promised to end this distribution, Zastava continued to send up to 6.5m euros over the past three years.
The agreement with Fiat reported that "the external products [are more than 20 per cent of the value of companies] -- including state, local loans and employees.
The talks with the previous government plans and Peter Collan Group, Today and Volfagen were unable to disagree with the proposals that Zastava will be sold and attracting investments. In 2003, the company agreed to accept a mobile mobile phone model for the sale of 500,000 employees, with 4,500 hectares of foreign producers, and a foreign produc
However, such a huge government intervention is needed: a loan of 240m euros, especially for a plan to pay eight years.
The magazine plan, led by the Zastava administration in recent months, is a two-year increase in the structure, and only 40,000 pieces of scientific production.
In the first half of the year, the problem was planning to invest 18,500 euros for 2004.
Nevertheless, the head of the parliamentary committee, Veroljub Stevanovic, said the Zastava plan was believed to be built next year.
However, Serbia has not yet yet yet to remove this expensive expenditure.

Another official said the Kogalescu airline or neighbouring Romanian military presence should not be a major military unit for the reconstruction of the US military presence, but that more soldiers should be able to cover their joint training exercises.
US Defence and Foreign Affairs experts are expected to visit Romania and Bulgaria in November to visit a "unhappy" that we want to do with a high-level defence official in New York.
"I think it will be a new one," he said.
However, there is no reason for us. "

In addition, he signed a co-operation agreement with Macedonia to prevent many weapons of weapons.

PACE wants to resolve issues in Western Balkans
North Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are political areas.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times -- 14 / 10 / 11
As part of the decision, the PACE committee "seeks to improve the dialogue" in the region and eliminate the removal. [PACE]
The Council of Europe (PACE) issued a decision last week revealed that the need for a solution to the political situation in northern Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania.
"The political situation in northern Kosovo and the free movement of persons and commercial goods in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a serious concern about the government 'political relations between the main parties in Albania and Albania," Bjen Synw, a Swedish member of the PACE, told SETimes.
As part of the October 7th decision, the incident has been investigated as a result of six people in the Kosovo border with Serbia and the results of six people, which were shown at the end of September.
The resolution said the problems in northern Kosovo have been prevented by the EU mediator of the Pristina talks.
At the same time, the "dialogue" has been offered to establish a delegation that is part of the PACE committee "for restructuring and removing.
The delegation "could work to take steps towards the principles of the principles of European Council principles," Von Sydow said.
Ian Bancroft, a founder of the Transnistrict Conflict, emphasised that Northern Kosovo will protect as one of the basic issues, and stressed the importance of talks.
"If the problems in the north are resolved, there is no chance for the success of Kosovo talks," he told SETimes.
"It is crucial to the EU because the talks can be successful.
Serbia is now on its EU candidate status, and the EU could have a major pressure on it.
However, if Serbia wants to make progress in the negotiations with the EU, the message of its obligations against the EU will have to be really conciliation to improve relations with Kosovo, "he said.
Another concern is the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The decision noted that the stalemate was "higher than 75 per cent of foreign investments in the country since 2009, when the international financial institutions" dropped the credit rating from 75 per cent to 43 per cent of the population.
According to Von Synw, the problem is "convincing the situation," the main forces "to discuss the situation of international financial support, and that the country does not block the stage of the national economy."
While noting details in Bosnia and Herzegovina, all are doing the way to find a solution to the problem, the Bank says.
"The Republika Srpska has refused to strengthen the government in the state level, repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly opposing the new ministries that will not be resolved, and it will lead to a solution to the basic problems, which will not be resolved," he said.
"All political parties in the country are encouraging their democratic structures, the political parties in the country are encouraging to develop democratic structures, work to normalise the political situation in the country, and to launch political dialogue on the necessary issues that need to fulfil the reforms," PACE said, praised the outcome of the 2011 local elections.
However, analyst Miroslav Mlloja believes that such progress is very difficult.
"The two main political parties in the two main political parties [the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party] have shown any move, but they say they will have to show the need to eliminate the consensus in the article," Mlloja told SETimes.

Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said on Tuesday (June 27th) that Serbia is ready to reach a compromise on the future status of Kosovo, but would not accept a compromise on the island.
"The Dayton is not a compromise, and Serbia cannot accept a compromise," Kostunica told reporters after talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Croatian Journalists Award for Reconstruction
SEEMO submitted its first award last month: "De Erhard Bekek-SEEMO", the Croatian journalist Denis Latin ". [No] can be difficult for journalists in the Balkans.
A good journalist must be a general.
However, this is not a easy job, even if the people do not understand the creation of interethnic conflicts, or that politicians are doing their jobs, or are not easy.
By Let Barack for Southeast European Times - 18 / 11 / 02
A journalist in the Balkans could be difficult.
A good journalist should not be a generation of generation and that all events can be able to do.
This is not a easy job, if we have been convinced that the conflict in recent years, they have been pushing for the streets or politicians' families.
Thousands of journalists in the Balkans have to live in their lives and have to participate in the results of the general consequences.
Now, a new organisation decided to different efforts by journalists from the Southeast Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO).
Last month, SEEMO received the first award: "Dr Erhard Bekek-SEEMO". A group of media professionals from 400 candidates "in Southeast Europe", said Denis Latin, who won this year.
Latinica 'television programme, Latinica, announced that it would focus on several controversial issues, not to normalise relations between Croats and Serbs.
"The Serbian tourists should be disappointed in the Adriatic Charter of Croatia?" Latin said in one of the recent programmes.
The council was doing a hotel.
Serbs and Croats in the former Yugoslavia were in their homes.
Both communities were ununfair, unfortunately, and frequently falling the spots and diseases.
But since the war in Croatia in 1991, many former Serbs have been able to restore their holidays in this summer.
Several years ago, Serbia has been able to open the West, and some Serbs have repeatedly opposed to a restructuring of Croatia &ap91; in the mechanisms].
This was not a lot of surprise, when the war was revealed in the Dalmatia coast.
Latin decided to remove the issue.
Both sides of the Sandzak have expressed their readiness to peaceful peace between Serbs and Croats, and the nationalists are unable to ask Serbs to take a step on Croatian territory.
The tension between the two groups has reached a point of resources, but all agrees that a compromise is time.
SEEMO secretary-general Aleksandar Vujovic said Latin [is affected by the Croatian media] to address the issues that are not the major part of the Croatian media.
However, there is only one of several newspapers who work to improve bilateral disaster in the Balkans.
Over 400 candidates have been revealed on the award. Vujovic said he was "very working to make a decision", adding that "Bay Latin was a very good job for many other journalists who have been nominated for the candidate," he said.
The new award, supported by Southeast European Special Co-operation Erhard Busek, is only one of the events of SEEMO. The organisation also includes the legal framework of journalists' legal framework for the event, and is also part of the logistic activities that will be in line with international standards.
The SEEMO is doing any problem, and the Members of the Members of Southeast Europe have made it clear that the SEEMO has made it clear that the organisation has made it clear. But it is not a diplomatic approach to the organisations, which is not impossible to increase the number of uncertainty.
A political party of Albanian asylum seekers came to SEEMO has decided to protest a local Macedonian television meeting in Tetovo, Macedonia.
Vujovic also stressed the importance of the need for all media meetings to be open.
The party leader said it was not delay to respond to this approach: the Democratic Party leader vowed that the decision would not be removed.
SEEMO also supports journalists for dangerous security.
"The problems facing journalists have changed the country. But we have the biggest problems in the region, which are linked to people who are linked to the poor or," Vujovic said.
Police are unwilling to journalists, and most of the Serb journalist Slavko Djurija were still in three years after the murder of the house of the house.
Journalists in the region do not have enough resources to see the lack of researcher journalism for the integration of the broadcast and broadcasting organisations.
"Every journalist [is] to think that [is] a good journalist," Vujovic said. "The response is to respond to the response, which will affect the outcome of this outcome."
Serbia faces Gazprom
Serbs are seeking to question the benefits of close relations with Russian Gazprom.

Russian Gazprom is in the final phase of talks with joint countries in the South Stream pipeline, expected to be completed in 2015.
They include concerns about the effect of public and political opposition to Gazprom.
Serbia has great expectations to do the South Stream.
The project is also promised to exercise gas prices to Serbia.
Gazprom Vice-President Aleksandar Medvedev said Russia will invest 10 billion cubic metres of gas to Serbia, which is expected to be expected to join the pipeline, while Russian gas supplies to the Balkans have been frozen in 2009 because of the dispute between Russia and Ukraine.
The Serbian public, however, has warned that Srbijagas and Gazprom will initiate a second joint initiative to build the 400km pipeline of Serbia.
The joint initiative also increased questions in the scandals that Serbian officials can reach an agreement with EU officials in Zug, Switzerland.
Experts and opposition leaders suggest that the second initiative will be sent to Switzerland, which is prepared to build a current Serbian joint initiative, which is prepared to send a 200m euros for potential transition wages.
In recent months, Russian delegation visited Belgrade.
The delegation also voiced support for Serbia &aposs position on Kosovo.
According to the daily Vecernje Novosti on March 28th, Medvedev assured that a recent visa-free visa-free visa-based agreement on Serbian citizens would mean a "increase in natural gas".
Nevertheless, the majority of Serbian citizens have not refused to resign, saying that Belgrade is believed to sell the Serbian public oil company NIS for a very low price in diplomatic support for Russia.
Last December, Gazprom 'company Gazprom has offered the NIS to invest 500m euros in investment by 2012.
Experts said the two refineries and 400 gas supplies, as well as the real value of the Serbian firm, along with other assets.
While Moscow is the position of the energy future of Serbia, the bilateral partnership is slowly slow.
After the NIS accepted a financial report in 2008, Russia announced a 47m-euro profit of 28m euros.
KPMG will be the latest restaurant company KPG.
In addition to the lack of a closer partnership with Russia, Gazprom is now demanding that a court in Belgrade is now demanding that the Serbian police unit would cancel 100m euros to the NIS, as well as the Serbian police officers' state-owned enterprises, as well as the Serbian police.
Gazprom NIS is opposed to the sale of a 6.6m-euro stake in the Belgrade Hospital Report.

According to the latest survey by the German Studies Centre, youth in Serbia faces a number of challenges, such as unemployment, low salaries, concrete economic recovery, and improved development.
These factors have caused the immigration of the country.
In the past few years, about 300,000 young people from Serbia, including 8 per cent successful university students.
This figure has increased in 2003, while a survey between 16 and 35 young people showed that a 43 per cent opportunity is ready to leave the country, according to a survey of 43 per cent.
In order to slowly slowdown, university students have formed the Association of Serbia, which helps young people to assist.

The centre is planning to meet the students' success in the next year, which will be sold on the main highway.
Borislav Aleksic, a professor of electricity, says Serbia will not be able to live in a better life in the country.

As a result, youth are seeking to develop a compromise strategy, they say they are doing everything to do with universities.
Polls suggest that 77 per cent of the young men and women live in their homes, and the possibilities for a expansion of their homes are likely to become part of an expanded structure, including the mountains.
Among these issues, Tomanovic said, the results from the last survey have been blocked by the survey "hope that the consequences" will bring the ideological levels in the society, and that youth can achieve a bridge for the youth. "

Following the start of Croatia &aposs EU accession talks, Zagreb has been sparked more pressure on the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on Monday (February 21st) to co-operate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and to extradite key war crimes fugitive General Ante Gotovina.
"The Western Balkan countries continue to be one of the basic requirements for full co-operation with the ICTY," EU foreign ministers said in a statement after the meeting in Brussels. "The remaining suspects should be able to hand over the Union as soon as possible and transfer to The Hague."
On December 17th, EU leaders have been able to launch accession talks with Croatia on 17 March, with the increase of full co-operation with the ICTY and extradite Gotovina.
Gotovina, one of the most wanted indictees, was dismissed in mid-2001, after UN prosecutors charged him with his alleged role in the murder of at least 150 Krajina Serbs in Croatia during the end of the 1991-1995 conflict.
In a letter to the EU presidency last week, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said authorities did not "do everything" to arrest him.
Del Ponte also accused the authorities' support 'support as "limited and effective".
As a result, he said, Croatia cannot approve full co-operation with The Hague.
Officials in Brussels welcomed the decision in December, but said Croatia will welcome its EU membership, but must fulfil the requirement for co-operation.
"There is no surprise, it is a precondition for the start of negotiations," said Jean Azerbaijan, the foreign minister of Luxembourg, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Croatian authorities have said they have pushed efforts to surrender, but insisting that any information has proved that Gotovina is in the country.
"Our work of our universities is more complete with international experts," President Stipe Mesic, who is scheduled to visit Brussels in early March.
I am convinced that we will happen, "he said.
"In this case, we are doing us to show that we are in accordance with transparency, and full responsibility," Reuters quoted Croatian Foreign Minister Kolinda Grajarovic as telling reporters in Brussels on Monday. "I am convinced that we will do our efforts to do with the EU."
The next meeting of EU foreign ministers will take place on 16 March, when Brussels must decide whether to start talks with Croatia and start negotiations with Croatia.

Serbian Youth and Sports Minister Snezana Samardzic-Markovic said the state will take a series of measures to block the violence among sports sites in the country.
The state will invest serious investments in the sports infrastructure, for improving its successful circumstances.
In an exclusive interview with Southeast European Times correspondent Bojana Milovanovic, the latest incidents, measures, and the government is interested in optimism about the future of the country.
SETimes: Following the killings of French football legend Bridge Taton, violence between the entities and the Serbian public have been a serious effect.
How will Serbia see these problems?
Snezana Samardz-Markovic: We are working on various ways.
For us, we have no factors of the interior and justice ministers, the ministry is facing violence through the primary and training studies.
One of the most important developments in the past period is the establishment of a government meeting of the judiciary, judiciary representatives, sports and journalists.
The message is that the success in the fight against violence can be made only if it is moved to the institutions.
Both sports sites should not be involved in each other, and the monuments of the Ottoman clubs are also convinced.
Both sides argue that there are some steps, and some steps are being taken into a initiative to adopt the constitution, which is known as the constitution and calls for violence, the Serbian Constitutional Court is now being conducted by the Serbian Constitutional Court.
A action plan that envisions a series of measures against violence is also on the agenda.
In addition, the Britain model is not implemented in Serbia, and it is the current working group.
SETimes: Serbia is very successful, but the most successful circumstances of successful revenues are more worse than the results.
How will Serbia be able to keep the best theatre conditions?

Samardz-Markovic: The problem is in the poor situation of sports facilities in the country.
In the past two years, Serbia has rebuilt 170 open tennis stations in schools and schools, or 40 sports flights, four aircraft and an explosive branch.
The National Theatre Centre for Split, which was injured in a city, resigned after 20 years.
He was completely completely completely completely, and the airline has been forced to think that a successful mandate was successful.
Now, it has become a facility.
"We will open a very important sports in Serbia next year, in co-operation with international sports organisations.
More than 50 candidates from the country will open the sports scene by the end of the year.
The state will also turn up to 600 euros, such as the swimmer Milorad Cavic, as well as more than 250 euros.
SETimes: What is the biggest problem in the Serbian youth and what is the ministry of ministry for resolving this problem?
Samardz-Markovic: Serbia is the only regional country that is not the national youth strategy.
This is not only a precedent, but the lack of a political assessment, because this strategy does not mean that any idea of ideas that Serbia will do with young people in the same period, the youth system is unacceptable.
I am very satisfied with that, since May 9th 2008, Serbia has a strategy for young people.
I think that the ministry has been able to do so, and it was a youth office in Serbia, which has only five of the 167 municipalities.
This reflects a situation in the society.
"We have changed in the process, and we will open the 100th youth office on November 9th.
The aim of such units is to find a solution to the basic problems that the young people have expressed.
The first problem is insufficient, insufficient, lack of information and the third edition of the third edition of the water.
The youth will help the mayor of the young people, and the local government has to see their activities and make it difficult to respect them.

These young people are also responsible for the event and activities.
Meanwhile, two initiatives for young people are being implemented in support of youth.
The young people in Serbia are working for the start of the year.
I want the young people to have their own jobs, and I want to work for them.
SETimes: How do you think the life of young people in Serbia and the quality of life in other countries in the region?
Samardz-Markovic: We are now convincing more than other countries in the region, and this is the European Council of Europe, which is the only unilateral representative of the youth policy in Europe.
This development, which began with the National Youth Strategy, has been a major geography.
We are in an example of this country, and we have a member of the Council of Europe, as well as the 46 other countries.
SETimes: Several young people in the 1990s were in Serbia.
This is not even more, but the current situation is still at the same time.
How do you see the circumstances and return to Serbia?
Samardz-Markovic: In 2007, we have investigated a research to overcome the small environmental environmental environmental circumstances and to raise Serbia.
The results of the same research in 2009 showed that the trend is 10 per cent. "It is one of the Youth Fund for Youth, which can reduce the immigration of the immigration".
As part of the Fund, there were 2200 and awards.
These are young people who have returned to Serbia after the best students and injuries of Serbia, and are allowing them to work at least five years, while they want to be more competitive.
As part of the Youth Fund, the Centre for Conference is also a member of the Municipality. The centre is helping young people to use their best.

Germany, Spain and Italy have argued the current account of smaller changes, while France, the Netherlands and Britain are calling for a new constitution.
The British authority is opposed to institutions in Brussels.
If the constitution is unacceptable, the candidate countries could have serious effects on their hopes.

Those are still unable to meet all requirements for Croatia, even though the new country is still unable to establish its cabinet and policies, Croatia has not met all its membership requirements.
Although the Western Balkans' European future is not a debate, regional countries will have to wait to resolve the problems of the EU.
"We need to change some rules in the EU," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
The EC will focus on "insufficient" force ", analysts stressed, stressing that the process should be made by European citizens.
This is a key condition that Dutch and French citizens are refusing to reject the draft constitution, which would threaten the "intelligence and living standards of Europe".
Members of the summit reiterated their commitment to the enlargement process.
"The future of new members is a historic opportunity that will contribute to peace, security, democracy, rule of law, the rule of law and the contribution of the EU," the statement said in a statement.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn voiced optimism, saying the summit would open a "new compromise".
This consensus should "strengthen our interest in the creation of a peacekeeping, democracy and prosperity region in Europe, as well as to accept new members," Rehn said.
Western Balkan countries have promised membership in the Thessaloniki summit in 2003, and this was accepted by many documents.
Last autumn, Croatia and Turkey began its accession talks, while Macedonia was granted candidate status.
Albania recently signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, while Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina have not yet taken.

Officials from the International Olympic Committee (ATHOC) and the Athens 2004 Organisation Committee (ATHOC) have criticised the criticism of the Year Games.
"It is positive," IOC President Jacques Rogge told Greek media on Sunday (September 28th).
The president came a day after the Washington Post, which the secretary of secret figures have been revealed in security.
According to the report, a percentage of the movement was successful by one of the stock security points.
In Post, another reason is the success of explosive explosive explosives.
The US security plan was made by "all of the Greeks", the US security plan quoted him as saying.
"You know that we can be able to enhance chemical and chemical goods," he said, noting that the daily Intelligence reports that the police forces are expected to ensure the security of thousands of athletes and athletes that are expected to arrive in Athens more than a year ago.
In addition, the newspaper cited details in the establishment of a command and and control centre that would provide information from the Olympics, which would allow police to achieve as soon as possible.
However, Greek authorities have rejected allegations.
In a press release Sunday, ATHOC said security organisations are on the list of priorities for the Games and that all measures were taken to ensure that.
"Everything is the only truth of the ancient scenario and the reputation: Greece is preparing a major pace to establish the Olympic players in 2004," the statement quoted him as saying.
Greek government spokesperson Kos Prodi, who reaffirmed organisations' remarks, said the critics were not "unrealistic relations".
"There are some groups who believe that we can preserve pressure on us, but we continue to move forward on the most important Olympics," Prodi said.
Greece has allocated a 64m-euro budget for security organisations.
The largest security operation will expect more than 45,000 police, military, military and private services in this Olympic history.
According to Reuters, the figure was about three points in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
In addition, the consultant group, including Australia, Britain, France, France, Germany, Israel, Spain and the United States, is ready to provide expertise.
He voiced confidence that the Greek government is "doing the best possible security arrangements", adding that "no one cannot ask about 100 per cent on Security."

The law envisions the SIE 'telephone talks in Romania. [File]
Last month, statements linked to the former head of the Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE), Clautin Safafafiu 'television programme, removed a debate on Romanian secret services' intervention in politics.
He said that during his mandate as presidential adviser, President Traian Basescu and former head of the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD), Mircea Geoana and former head of state Ion Ion Iliescu, had said that telephone talks between President Traian Basescu.
"I think that a two years ago," the former SIE chief said, "I have shown that he and Geoana [the Romanian presidency] has been restricted from illegal telephone conversations," he said.
Speaking on the hearing, he tried to change his remarks and said the president was not direct to the information, but that Basescu has made it clear to the media.
The president did not respond to these statements.
Basescu 'spokesperson Valeriu Tourism claimed the allegations and said Basescu would decide to the court for "really and insufficient statements".
"If they claim that Romanian citizens are doing information about the political or private life: the president is charged with the president of conviction of a crime," he said, noting that Basescu was the first president of the Romanian Intelligence Service (SII) and the Romanian Intelligence Service (SII).
Both agencies have said they were in the field of telephone talks.
"Year [are] discovered," Iliescu said.
"I hope that Bay Safariu will be discovered," Geoana said.
This is the first year ago, the Safariu said, a parliamentary commissioner, who said that Safariu 'intelligence agencies had not tried to extradite their citizens' intelligence services.
The law envisions SIE 'mobile phones in Romania, but it can be able to decide whether the prosecutor is not in court.
Although the explosive scandal was resigned, the scandal has made a close relationship with Basescu and forced him to resign.
The latest scenario was a result of the public debate on the 298 / 2008 2008 law on telephone talks, messages and textbooks.
According to the law, all telephone meetings should be able to give up their data for six months: identification of identity, churches, circumstances and mandate.
Since March 15th, Internet services will have to survive the analysis about all e-to-fixed data.
The state agencies will have an investigation into a crime, while statistics will have the right to work.
Critics are concerned that the law will lead to civilian freedom.

A reaction in the north of Kosovo has two hours.
These are more than the borders of the border between Albanian and Serb population in the northern town of Sulejman, near the divided town of Mitrovica.
One of the Albanian owner, he says, is impossible to build construction because local Serbs reject their plans.
Police and KFOR have resigned to leave Albanian neighbours for more than a year.
The disputed dispute over a number of ethnic incidents -- for example of a number of ethnic incidents in late 2008 -- is an example of instability and tension to Mitrovica, when a Serbian businessman began in late 2008.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci promised the future of legal and public pressure in both parts of Kosovo, and also to visit Mitrovica.
Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi said police, EUFOR and KFOR support full support for their activities.
According to Rexhepi, many ethnic states that started in the weeks ago have a confidence among the people ".
In addition, we are supporting them to ensure a safe and secure environment for all, "Interior Minister Zenun Payititi said, praising the safety of the countries.
On January 23rd, Mitrovica police spokesperson Besim Hoti told the Pristina Express that the police had arrested two local Serbs, saying there were some progress.
"Police [were arrested for] dozens of doctors [," Hoti said. "The violence against more than 50 [ethnic Albanians] by the ethnic Albanians.
Although the north continues to exercise Kosovo, some people, such as Christian Science Monitor Ashrad, are facing some reasons for a major optimistic optimism.
He argues that Serbia and the EU have started "a clear co-operation", because Belgrade is not in line with EU membership.
According to del Ponte, the Serbian analysts "refuse to boost their activities", while Kosovo police, EULEX police and KFOR peacekeeping forces have stalled "Albanian flags".
In addition to some journalists in Serbia and Kosovo, as well as some journalists in Kosovo, such as Payaziti say the fall is more than ethnic violence as a reason for the reason, and the Serbian and Albanian criminal groups are seeking to show their interests.
Nevertheless, the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AEC) has accused the government of failing to make sufficient efforts for ethnic Albanians in the north.
AEC chief and former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said on Sunday (February 8th) that he could reunify the town of Mitrovica in three months after the ruling.
The November elections in Kosovo will be held in November.
Schwarz-Schilling is "unhappy" in BiH lawmakers.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is now in a serious political crisis and the European road, the High Representative said on Wednesday.

High Representative and EU Special Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling told members of the state parliament on Wednesday (June 13th) that it is time to start dialogue on constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Following the end of his mandate, Schwarz-Schilling said BiH is a serious political crisis in BiH, due to progress in reforms, the security of politicians and the negative negative consequences of people in the public.
"I am convinced that the politicians have been able to build confidence and concrete progress among all sides, and I am convinced that they have credibility among the public and policies that have created concrete progress," he said.
"Do you accept the referendum and the parties' interest to vote?
How can this country be accepted to create concerns about other events in the region to protect their products?
I say this is unacceptable, "he added.
In the past few days, political leaders in BiH have met with Schwarz-Schilling and the United States to step up the reform process.
Bosnian presidency member Haris Silajdzic and Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik visited Washington to meet with the US State Department, but talks were not a significant change.
Since then, the high representative has decided to send high representatives.
Last year, a constitutional reform package did not win the parliament.
The last elections are still under the third majority, which needs to implement parliament support.
"We support the election package of constitutional reform, because we will likely have to start new negotiations due to the lack of political will," Dodik said after meeting with international representatives.
The main dispute is the ruling parties in parliament.
Most of the Bosniak representatives oppose a precondition of approval of a certain lawmakers for any bill.
Bosniak lawmakers say this would slow down.
However, RS counterparts are determined to protect the situation, arguing that it would be removed in the number of votes if it removed.
International officials warn that the political crisis does not block BiH 'progress towards EU membership, and warns that the public is pushing for politics.
BiH has not reached an agreement on police reform, Schwarz-Schilling said on Wednesday, although it is facing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU for months.
He said he has decided to close the Office of the High Representative (OHR), such as the Peace Implementation Council, planned for the situation in BiH and the region.
"This is a step," Schwarz-Schilling said. "The OHR does not want to ensure peace and stability in the period of political instability."

The disputes between Turkey and the EU have slowed their efforts to boost defence and defence co-operation, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer met with officials in Ankara this week.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Turkey is not opposed to improving relations between NATO and the EU, but this should be done with current mechanisms.
According to the "Berlin Plus" agreement in 2002, the strategic co-operation between the two organisations that are not a member of NATO or Peace.
However, the country has become a member of the EU, including the northern part of the Turkish administration since then, insisting that other new members of the Union should be part of the Union in 2004.
This is a major dispute for Turkey, which does not recognise the Greek Cypriot administration in the south.
Ankara argues that Nicosia should not be allowed to submit the session of the EU-NATO peacekeeping missions, as a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus issue over the past decades.
Turkey is seeking to block the European Defence Agency, which is a commission to strengthen the European weapons industry, to help Cyprus' European weapons.
"The money was made in 2002," the daily Zaman quoted him as saying.
"We have to expect Turkey as a country that has a major contribution to NATO, and we should not expect more membership on this issue," he said.
In such cases, the EU should be able to find a solution if it does not see it as a decision. "
The situation could affect co-operation between NATO troops and the police mission in Kosovo.
Although the UN Security Council is currently under UN Security Council plan, the EU could take over police mission in Kosovo this year.
The planned mandate is concerned about 1,500 EU personnel who served as 16 NATO peacekeeping missions.
However, the framework of EU co-operation in Kosovo must be implemented in the first time.
Turkey, NATO and the EU contributed to peacekeeping and stability operations in the world, including Afghanistan.
Last week, however, Ankara decided to resume its commitments on future peacekeeping missions.
As a NATO member, Turkey promised to send a letter to the Black Sea Golden, a military target that has been taken under the EU security and defence strategy.
However, the decision by the EU 'proposed Turkish letter' '' '' 'to' 'forces' '' '' '' '' '' 'un
In addition, Turkey has also been under the EU operations under the EU-EU co-operation framework, but also above its control and control.
De Hoop Scheffer told reporters during his visit to Ankara that talks between partners will be a constructive airport.
He arrived in Brussels to attend the NATO defence ministers meeting.
Report: UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier
SETimes corresponded with UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier to discuss the current role in the country, relations with Belgrade and the future of UNMIK.
"The meeting with Belgrade is easy to discuss the highest level of UNMIK officials," Zannier said. [File]
SETimes: How do you recognise the current role of the UN mission in Kosovo in Kosovo, when the international peacekeeping forces are speaking, the current speech of international peacekeeping forces, and how will the EU mission in Kosovo?
Zannier: The UNMIK Security Council continues to operate in accordance with the mandate of 124.
However, the incidents of the EU legal mission were required to resume the mission, including the start of its mandate in December.
Therefore, the mission has emphasised the political role of the mission.
Furthermore, ensuring the report and report, facilitating better relations with all communities in Kosovo, the facilitation of transportation representation is also supported by the process of resolving technical problems between Pristina and Belgrade.
The mission also continues to play a role in the areas where he played.
For example, the mission could be given its management role in northern Mitrovica, and we are the only municipality that we have revealed such a doctor.
Another example is to facilitate the representation of Kosovo in Interpol.
SETimes: What is EULEX, the EU Special Representative and the International Civilian High Representative (ICO)?
How do you co-operate in many areas?
Zannier: international missions in Kosovo are working with different tasks.
Among us, EULEX is in Kosovo as part of the 124-strong decision.
Since then, EULEX has completed our job, such as the OSCE.
The co-operation with EULEX is very good.
Earlier this year, UNMIK and EULEX signed a number of technical agreements aimed at facilitating the invitation of judges, methods and assets by UNMIK.
So far, the head of the mission, Yves de Kermabon, continues to be held in many levels, including a number of meetings.
Tai is also submitted to a report that has been operating under UN authority, the EULEX has submitted a report on the general secret security agenda.
So far, the UN Security Council adopted the Ahtisaari Plan, so that there is no official co-operation between UNMIK and the ICO.
This is not a problem for us, because we see the role of the ICO as adviser to the government.
However, as the most EU special representative, Pieter Feith met with Pieter Feith, and this means a good information.
SETimes: How do you have a relationship with Pristina and Belgrade?
Do you think that we have been able to discuss our relations with Pristina and Belgrade?
"The UNMIK Directorate is the only legal authority in Mitrovica. [File]
Zannier: As the latest report submitted to the secretary general security, Kosovo authorities have been more direct among them.
The reason is that Pristina is ready to work with other international players.
However, we have a opportunity to discuss technical co-operation between Pristina and Pristina, and for example, security agencies and other international organisations, including Pristina officials.
UNMIK is more affected by the authorities in Kosovo, especially with all sides in Pristina, where we are working to resolve technical problems such as the return of the IDP in the north, such as the return of communities in the country.
Belgrade and Belgrade are easy to discuss the highest level of UNMIK officials.
"We discussed a broad market issues in various levels, including meetings between the secretary General Special Representative (SRG) and the government, as well as talks with the UN Open in Belgrade.
They can be changed until more technical debate on the general political changes.
SETimes: What is the only legal authority in northern Kosovo?
Zannier: I think the role of our role in the north is substantially presented in the media, and I think that we are doing this question.
The UNMIK Director for Mitrovica (UAM) is the only legal authority in northern Mitrovica, but in the north -- in the north, Kosovo -- is the only way to be accepted by all sides.
The UNMIK role is to avoid a administrative disaster to ensure the need for bridges such as disaster disasters.
Therefore, all sides recognise the UAM and we have the support of people who live in the region.
SETimes: As of the six-point plan, there is a comprehensive implementation of the architecture or in the region?
Zannier: The talks on unrest were held last year, and General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer took part in the November report on Kosovo.
So far, we have a very broad agenda in the report, and it has been transferred or people.
Another international players are also on the process.
UNMIK continues to support the participation of all sides' participation in reconciliation.
This issue is the fact that we need to be politicised, because we have made progress in a broad range of bridges.
The political scenarios causes all sides.
SETimes: How will you expect to see the UN mission in Kosovo in the future, and how will this mission is the agenda?
Zannier: The mission will continue to work to fulfil its mandate.
So far, we will continue to be the main point of our political role, especially in the society, as well as their relations.
"I think any significant change in the role of the mission in the near future.
However, if you know, the mission has stalled every time and we will continue to assess the situation and we will continue to assess any changes in the future, and we will do everything in consensus with the UN headquarters.

In an unprecedented move earlier this month, the Turkish government punished about 1.7 billion euros to Dodik, the largest media group in the country, which was punished in February.
The punishment of a Turkish firm could be a obstacle to the EU integration process.
Dodik Media Group, the owner of the newspapers and television stations, says that the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has been targeted due to the continuation of talks between the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
In March, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the public to boycott the newspapers' newspaper 'allegations that the AKP has been removing "unnecessary".
The reports allegedly claimed the government in the medics of the Denmark Freedom Association, which was founded by Turks in Germany.
According to the media, more than half of the million donors were transferred to Turkey in 2007.
A German court accused three Turkish citizens of corruption and sent the Turkish judiciary to continue all documents.
The court also noted that some AKP members, including his close friend of Erdogan, could be linked to corruption.
The Egyptian group claims that the money against Turkey has been spent on the establishment of pro-government news agencies such as the Canada.
Those allegations are convinced and the public has not been submitted to the tribunal, despite the pressure.
A investigation is said to continue.
Erdogan refuses that tax administration is independent, saying the penalties in Egypt are a political force.
The Egyptian Group has about 50% of the Turkish media sector, including newspapers, Milliyet and Radical Radicals, Canadian and Staff Warner.
If the ceremony is other than a few independent companies.
According to Turkish law, the Egyptian group has two seats in front of the group.
The group can accept the allegations of tax evasion and demands the reduction of the penalty pension or will invest in a significant amount of amount to the court.
The EU has now expressed concern.
A spokesperson said the penalties could affect the report on Turkey &aposs progress next week.
"We are still concerned about freedom of expression and independent groups that are not popular, and that are still concerned about rights.
And I think it is still a teacher that should be a part of a multi-European democracy and most of the country. "

Serbia will try to sell the national airline JAT Airport, which is estimated to spend about 300m euros.
It was the first success for the sale of 51% stake in 2008 (51m euros), and no company has not been on the prices.
This time, the state has decided to change its strategy and submit a new company that has no potential partners.
The requirement for participating in the tender is that at least 1.5 million passengers and 200m euros in 2010.
The new company was presented as symbolic Newo.
The applications for accession will be adopted by September 30th.
The government representatives believe that the bidder will be better for potential investors.
"The partner will have a new company with the state of Serbia, while the JAT is currently a complex, the current film [in the world] is now the best airline with the world and the best airport," said Air Trade Minister Miodrag Milovic.
But Belgrade economist Mehmet Busatvia has concerns about the success of the JAT sale.
"The tender is a time when the global economic crisis seems to win.
Therefore, people are able to travel before.
These conditions are completely completely completely that the Serbian airline will reach an agreement with the state, "he said.
Busatvia is a controversial decision: the government [is] controversial: JAT] [debt] is to raise its debt, and to increase Serbian tax taxes.
"Instead, the state must reduce JAT restructuring, reducing its debt and to ensure more functioning.
However, there is a lot of political and professionalism in such cases in Serbia, "he said.
Economist Milan Kovacevic said the JAT is the most important presence of private websites.
However, there is no success of this tender.
"The right of the JAT is a real reason.
"We are not able to find that, but it is increasingly increasing the number of companies and employees," he said.
In Belgrade, the political opposition opposed the tension.
The Serbian Radical Party said the JAT is 220m euros, and the government wants to sell at low prices.
"The decision by the Serbian government to sell JAT strategic partnership is a plan to sell the company 'goods and to bring the JAT' debt to the state and Serbian citizens," the Radical Party said.
The agency, a strong airline, has declined in operations over the past 20 years.
According to official data, the JAT movement is only 14 mountains -- 7377 and four ATRF -- four and four.

In an effort to demonstrate Turkey &aposs leader in Libya, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with leaders of the National Council of Justice (NTC) on Tuesday (August 23rd) to meet with leaders of the prosecutors' tripartite Libya.
During his visit, Davutoglu confirmed that NATO support will continue until the security process is reached, but stressed the need for a stable, stable, stability and unified Libya.
Davutoglu also vowed that the Libyan Contact Group political directors will focus on issues at a meeting in Istanbul on Thursday, saying the financial and financial support.
"The reason for the Turkish foreign policy is the reason for this time," said German Marshall Financial Affairs Commissioner Josepa Walker. "It is the first leader of the international community to expansion the influence of the influence of the influential influence in Libya, which will be broadcast."
"The special website [Turkey] and information from Turkey.
Vise.com for the past few months.
Several: There is a special news website on Turkey.
We have visited Telecom in the coming weeks to provide more information.
In February, the first round of discrimination against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was in Turkey and NATO intervention.
Turkey has been charged with "smaller", putting the interests and ideology.
Turkey 'Gaddafi was the rise to the Gaddafi, and the large number of economic resources in the construction sector have been caused.
About 25,000 Turkish citizens have worked in Libya, and the architecture firms took part in the project.
In May, however, Turkey urged Gaddafi to resign and recognised the NTC in early July.
Since then, the country has played a positive role in supporting the athletes.
In July, Turkey hosted the fourth Libyan Contact Group meeting in Istanbul, and the last few weeks have been hosting a large amount of interest and money laundering to Travis.
Turkish athletes have been dealing with the international community, and the witnesses say the pressure will be sparked.
Although the NTC and friendly relations are now defined, Turkey is now on to play a major economic and political role in Libya.
"Turkey will continue to build economic relations with Libya, but it will now be able to establish democratic interests in the Libyan political process, while the Libyan political transition process will now be able to improve its role in the region," said Dushne Djury, high researcher of the Middle East Democracy Project (POMOD).
"It is one of the most important factors in Turkey, as Ankara has the opportunity to provide regional population and support.
As NATO membership and the OIC chairman, the international support for a unique Libya could be a bridge between Middle East and the West, "the observer said.
Gaddafi is expected to be expected soon, with pressure in Syria, urging Turkey to initiate its regime and urging them to end violence.
"They in Libya are a sign for the leaders of the region.
"The leaders who have not promised to give their people are not in power," he warned.
While Syrian pressure continues to continue, the reform commissioners are not reluctant by Turkey and Davutoglu said there is no reason that he will be done with Assad, Turkey has been trying to resign or resigned to resign.
Nevertheless, the Libyan staff shows that Turkey [its stance] could be very difficult, and the Assad regime could start to see it.
"If something in Syria will continue to continue this relationship between Erud and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Even if Turkey is in Libya, there is a unique concrete action in the international community, it will not be a concrete action if it is in accordance with the leaders of Turkey, "he said.
Merkel to Belgrade
Some environmental sources say Serbia is unfair issues with European integration and Kosovo, but German leader Angela Merkel has made a different position to Belgrade.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Serbia on Tuesday (August 23rd) and President Boris Tadic was not a message.
During talks, Merkel was linked to Serbia &ap91; European integration process] with the continuation of Kosovo.
This is the last message that Serbian officials, who are convinced that European integration and Kosovo are in two separate areas.
Merkel is aware of the message: Germany wants Serbia in the EU, but this should be made in the dialogue with Pristina, in the dialogue with Pristina, to operate in the completion of EULEX, and the "parallel parallel structures" in Kosovo.
"Germany recognised Kosovo, while Serbia recognised it.
This is a situation that needs to make progress, "he said.
The prime minister, however, did not require Belgrade to recognise the independence of Pristina.
Belgrade considers its own state institutions operating in Kosovo, which has refused to recognise money, but not more independence.
Merkel said that the Kosovo issue is a long time, but stressed that it is expected to see Belgrade on its path to EU membership.
"Therefore, it is better to resolve the difficult problems," he said.
Tadic said he did not respond to "parallel structures", but that Serbia has its own principles and is not "unacceptable" to the EU.
"Serbia has its own principles to resolve the conflict, and we want to find a very important way to protect all people in the region," Tadic said.
He pledged that Serbia will continue dialogue with Pristina authorities.
Predrag Simic, a professor of the Belgrade Political Sciences, said Merkel 'message should accept the Ahtisaari plan on Kosovo.
"The Ahtisaari plan will have to accept the implementation of the Ahtisaari plan and will be the way for EU membership," Simic told SETimes.
Serbia has rejected the Ahtisaari plan for its commitment to the UN Security Council -- Russia and Chinese -- to block the plan to ratify in the UN.
The plan envisions independence of Kosovo, with a certain level of autonomy.
Belgrade supports Serbs living in northern Kosovo without operating.
"It will be very bad for the interests of these institutions, as well as for the interests of the Serb community in Kosovo, as well as the interests of Serbs in the province," Aleksandar Mitic, director of the Kosovo Compromise Project, told SETimes.
Pristina officials repeatedly invited Merkel.
Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said Belgrade is "clear and fair messages".
However, analysts say Merkel 'visit is more deeply boycott.
Simic said that this is the first step in this time since Serbia has been shown by the leader of a G7 member since Montenegro declared independence in 2006.
"This is important because Germany has the most stable economy, and all the eurozone in a degree of economic crisis," Simic said.
Since 2000, Germany has invested 1.27 billion euros to Serbia.
Serbia exports to Germany to 760m euros, while Germany has reached 1.3 billion euros in exports to Serbia.

With the general elections in Serbia next year, the political parties are trying to punish voters and have been sparked to Belgrade, which is recognised by various parties.
The ruling coalition, led by President Boris Tadic 'Democratic Party, has suggested it as an example of successful policies in the EU integration process.
The opposition, however, criticised the governments of the ruling coalition as well as low living standards and widespread corruption.
Opposition analyst Srdjan Boavljevic emphasised the dissatisfaction could create a major impact on the participation of the elections in the next elections.
"The citizens are very happy.
The average salary in Serbia has been reduced over the past three years.
There is a big change, but citizens do not know that they will vote without the current candidacy. "
He believes the public expects more than political changes in 2000, and that the disappointment began.
Bogosavljevic expects representatives of the ruling coalition to emphasise "how to resume the economic crisis", and the political change will "reflect Serbia 'stability'.
Meanwhile, Bogavljevic says the opposition will focus on the poor economic situation to support the campaign.
He says the "nationalist interests" on the Kosovo issue "will be the opposition.
"Kosovo does not use a precondition for serious tensions, and there is no reason for people, economic and corruption," he said.
"In the next campaign, the opposition will be easily easily easy, because it will increase the criticism of the opposition, while authorities will have to see their actions and to improve their lives," Democratic Party spokesperson Jelena Trade told SETimes.
He said the government could praise its economic progress.
Some EU countries have not faced the external debt from Serbia or international financial institutions.
"We will emphasise progress in European integration, as well as our success in implementing organised crime and judicial reform," he said.
The Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), led by Tomislav Nikolic, is a major factor.
SNS official Marko Djuric said his party will focus on the election campaign "and details".
He added that the ruling coalition is tending tensions, while the majority contributed to the idea.
"We will submit a concrete programme in all areas and in every part of the society.
"We have announced our efforts to fight corruption and we will offer our plans in other areas, especially in the economy," he said.
He expects the campaign to be a "idea", and that Tadic is the largest political opponent of the Democratic Party.

According to the census, more than 7.3 million people live in Bulgaria in 2001.
"We have one of the worst situation in Europe, and the people are calling for [the third] population]," Bulgarian Scientific Academy of Scientific Academy Eva Dimitrova told SETimes.
As a result, the quality rates are reduced, "he said.
Government data shows that the largest growth is 65% -- 16.8% in 2001.
Experts say the census is a trend over the decades due to a major negative growth rate, but the cases are a factor of foreign immigration.
The current pace will be more than 5.4 billion euros by 2000.
It needs more resources to restore this, but Dimitrova argues that "it will continue to stop violence because it will reduce the number of people".
The population is almost three times, or 1.7 million people are "working".
The census was the most controversial zone of the ethnic lines, and different political groups have questioned that there is no reflection.
Many have been seen as a traditional rates, and donated by 0.2% to 4.9% compared to 2001, but the number of Roma has dropped.
Dimitrova said that the possible reason is the right to respond to the questionnaire on ethnic lines, adding that many Roma are likely to see them as a result of Bulgarian or other ethnic groups.
Roma continue to be the third ethnic community.
"The number of Romanians is not true," US Union of Roma President Zarko Chanov told SETimes.
"Many Roma live in the ethnic life for their discrimination, especially those who have achieved better education and social integration," Chanov said.
Chanov insists that the Roma can participate in the Internet, it does not have a major impact on the other possible reason for immigrants or experts.
Both Roma families have at least one in Bulgaria to improve their homes.
Sandzak Tomir Tomov is suspected of official figures.
"There are a number of assessments and that the number of Roma in some of them is two of their participation," Tomov told SETimes.
The results of the census showed that the number of Turks, the second largest ethnic group, dropped to 8.8% of the population.
A NGO representing the organisation "The Union" has not joined the census.
"If this is a trend, it is likely to be the factors such as people, such as people, and farmers," he told SETimes.
The municipality has many people and some are not in Bulgaria during the census, "he said.
"Another factor has been limited.
"There is a lot of people who live with the majority," he added.
Macedonian society representatives said the number of Macedonians showed a low rate of 1,600 people and that the community does not recognise the results.
The census revealed that one of Bulgaria is high education.
"I am positive," Dimitrova said, adding that education is a different issue.
Public polls suggest that the education standard has dropped in the past 20 years.
For the first time, a number of human categories -- 1.2% of the population -- were among 81% of the population.

Turkey seeks to export weapons of diplomatic and economic policy

Turkey has developed local weapons industry. [Reuters]
Turkey 'move was the local weapons industry, the monitoring of monetary oil market.
Therefore, the region is limited to weapons exports, but the private sector could cause broadcaster and strategic effects that Turkey will become a key weapons.
The AKP has become a national priority for developing local weapons and launched a policy to boost state investments in the local research and development sector in 2004.
This strategy seems to send its strategy -- Turkey has sold about 1 billion euros in 2010, with an increase of 200 million weapons in the early 2000.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a campaign to transform Ankara into the defence industry.
This policy is a key part of the AKP &aposs decision to produce high technological service -- the suspect, helicopter and humanitarian resources -- which can be able to enter the market later.
"Turkey has an important defence industry, and now has a position to bring foreign markets.
Turkey will not help further expansion of this industrial industry, but also increase its influence in the region.
Ankara is seeking to boost economic relations with neighbours, such as tourism, agriculture, farmers, farmers, construction, health and transport.
This is part of a comprehensive believed that economic and regional stability will benefit Turkey 'economic and security situation.
"Turkey has become a real transition for exports in the AKP administration," he added, adding that the Arab world and Iran are a chance for Turkey.
"The [AKP] conservative history has helped the US, European and Eastern Asia to help these markets," he said.
Nevertheless, Turkey has yet to pension military relations with the Middle East, and Turkish companies are facing challenges with major exports such as the United States and European countries.
He believes, however, that "Turkey will invest more investment in the coming years".
One of the main model of improving military co-operation with the West countries is that Turkey is "the regional and regional influence" in a bid to improve military co-operation with the United States, especially in the region, "said Arabian Nergizarian, a professor of professor at the Strategic and International Security Centre.
"If Turkey can improve its role in the Middle East and its leaders, it could be able to submit Turkey to accept the Union.
In addition, the Middle East countries can think a major role in Iran, which is a potential role in Iran, "he said.
However, he argued, "Turkey is the reason for its own in the Middle East, and the United States and the EU are not aware of how Turkey is doing its relations with the Middle East."
The region, however, could lead the region to its efforts to join the Middle East market.
Turkey is resolving a compromise with Syria, and Turkish initiatives are optimistic to commercial interests.
Meanwhile, a major weapons producer, Israel and weakened relations with the countries' military co-operation.
"The conservatives in the Middle East are unable to convince many questions about Turkey 'role in its role," according to Nergur.

The United States and Montenegro signed an agreement on Tuesday (May 1st) to open bilateral military co-operation.
The accord, known as the Constitutional Agreement (PAFA), was signed by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic last August.
Montenegro declared independence in June 3rd 2006.
Several weeks ago, more than 630,000 voters in the Adriatic republic supported the country 'union with Serbia in 2003.
"The United States is a friend of Montenegro and the common partner is a common partner in the Balkans," Rice said at a joint press conference with Vujanovic.
He added that the military co-operation agreement "is confident that US military personnel are working in Montenegro for the two entities".
The US Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that PAFA has been delayed in details that US military personnel and goods have recognised the legal status of the country.
The agreements include "intelligence and responsibility" between the two countries' governments and civilian areas, tax and customs issues, and resolving personnel 'goods and diseases' demands.
The agreement would allow Montenegro and the US armed forces to ensure that the armed forces will be able to operate in the structural changes, education, and other co-operation activities, Rice said.
Vujanovic, head of a delegation of Montenegrin foreign and defence ministers Milan Rocen and Boro Vucinic, signed the agreement during his first official visit to the United States since his country has declared independence.
"I want to [the] linking Montenegro and the United States to be a major step towards improving this relations," Vujanovic said at the signing ceremony. "I want to support the US administration and the US public to help Montenegro in accordance with the support of the democratic institutions, building democracy and reform of our economy."
Montenegro wants to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Vujanovic signed a framework for participating in the Partnership for Peace programme, considered the first step towards eventual membership in the Alliance in December.
Voicing support for Euro-Atlantic integration, Rice said his country would work together with Montenegro to achieve this goal.
Vujanovic said on Tuesday that the agreement would invest more US companies to invest in the country, encouraging the privatisation process and encourage Montenegrin companies to build partners.
"The signing of the PAFA agreement is a new basic element of our relations with values and that Montenegro is a safe environment, which is a new case to establish new economic partners," he said.
In 1999, the German bronze was privatised by about 90% of all victims and public companies and goods.
At the same time, the Adriatic coast has been explosives for tourism, and the country is among the highest tourist destinations in the world.
Romania Furges Furtherlands Programme
The average salaries in Romania are 13.5 and most of the West are in meeting the security and security standards.
Authorities have launched a national campaign to promote citizens, but critics say more must be done to ensure that they are in line with EU rules.

About 1.6m euros in Romania are a potential threat to traffic security and environmental security. [File]
About 38m euros have been discovered in Romania for more than 12 years ago.
Most of them have been produced in the fields of Dacia, Baghdat and Aro factory, where the Western security and security standards have been located.
Some of the former doctors have been exported from Western Europe after the communist era, but these are not good.
About 350,000 cars are more than 20.
This is a potential threat to traffic security by 1.6 million tonnes, and also a reason for air space.
"The average salary of the households is 13.5.
"We cannot be able to adopt the law because such a decision has caused serious social consequences.
But we have to protect the quality of the paper, "he said.
Authorities began steps on the issue.
As part of the ministry initiated by the ministry, more than 12 people can give them to communities in the province for 930 euros.
This money will be used for a new car.
However, the programme does not have its own problems.
The funding is under the amount of needed to buy a new car -- the cheapest car is more than 4,000 euros.
The average salary is 185 euros, and many in a country that is 62 euros, with the average pension.
Most are used to use the former car because it is no other option.
Some of them are seeking to sell the former branches to sell the government programme.
This has caused a significant increase in former car prices.
"I can sell about 100-year-old Baxcit, but I don '' 'said Radu Marinescu in Bucharest,' ''. I '' '' '' '' 'I' not
"I am happy and I will receive the Renault Clivo of 700," he said.
The programme critics say it is using the public to boost new car sales for the rest of the public, which is not in Romania.
"This will not create an important framework on EU rules. It will not have an important impact on the Airport, but it will produce a large amount of amounts, including some of them," former environmental ministry expert Catau Guri Capital said in an interview.
Another obstacle is insufficient.
The programme allows only 12m euros, and only 14,000 former car cars this year will be removed only 1 per cent of the number of targets.
Nevertheless, officials say the programme will continue in next year if it is successful.

In an interview with the daily Nezavisne Novine, two days ago, Packett said SFOR will do everything in its mandate to arrest Karadzic "or hand over Karadzic" before the end of this year, before the EU peacekeeping force is transferred to BiH.
The AFP quoted him as saying that Karadzic, 59, is "important health problems", which should be removed from other details.
"Karadzic is not a youth, the end of the approach," Packett said.
Karadzic and wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic are on the list of indictees indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal.
Both are charged with genocide for their role in the 1992-1995 war in BiH.
Despite his efforts to arrest SFOR, the suspects have failed to surrender since the war.
"Karadzic is hiding his country," Packett said on Monday. "Karadzic will have to do between Europe and Europe."
NATO decided last month to adopt the invitation for BiH &aposs Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme for membership in the country due to lack of co-operation with the BiH tribunal.
The Republika Srpska, which is the entity of the BiH Serb administration, is not able to hand over a single war crimes suspect.
Following NATO decision, High Representative Paddy Ashdown has been helping Karadzic to surrender with the Democratic Party of Serbia, and has implemented broad measures against individuals believed to face co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
"I cannot allow the future of all the country to ensure that the free movement of corruption and war crimes is more important for everyone, security and peaceful," Ashdown said in a statement released Monday by The Wall Street Journal.
Meanwhile, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer told the European Policy Centre on Monday that the Alliance still expects BiH to accept PfP.
De Hoop Scheffer said this could be possible after the country has fulfilled its membership requirements, including full co-operation with the UN tribunal.

It also praised Ankara for its "active and" constructive "foreign policy in the Caucasus.
Macedonia, the official EU candidate in December 2005, has not been able to start accession talks.

The parliamentary commission, which is prepared to prepare the new constitution of Montenegro, met on Tuesday (January 16th) after opposition members refused to participate.
However, there is no sign of broad compromise.
The ruling and opposition parties' official opinion are not the right to vote abroad and there is no agreement on many issues such as Montenegro '' '' '' state '' '' '' '' '' '
The ruling Socialist Party (DPS) has asked the ruling Socialist Party (DPS) to adopt any initiative that could cause the constitution, while the pro-Serbian opposition wants to make a referendum on a state union with Serbia in the future.
"The government is trying to remove the possibility of the citizens' citizens to accept a different decision, and encourage the current situation to overcome the current situation," said Velimir Kalerovic, a senior official of the Montenegrin Socialist Party (SNP).
The SNP also wants the right to vote for Montenegrin citizens, which opposes the end of the state union.
The government is also facing an exchange, especially with the pro-Serbian opposition, in which it was granted "Montenegro".
Opposition argues that 63% of the citizens are speaking to Serbs, but only 26% of Montenegrin speaks.
The Bosniak parties, meanwhile, want to change the military universities and fundamental factors of the women.
"We do not accept that the state symbolic symbols should not allow minorities to see them as well.
Some symbols are not reluctant, "he said.
The DPS and Social Democratic Party (SDP) pushed a "sovereignty abroad and pushing Montenegro as a sovereignty of sovereignty, while Bosniak and Serbian lawmakers say the new constitution should not recognise Montenegro as a community.
According to them, Bosniaks and Serbs should take part in the constitution as the founder of the Montenegrin state.
However, the DPS says it could cause a request.
According to the law, the constitution must vote in a two-thirds majority in parliament to accept the constitution.
Although only a smaller majority -- the ruling owners should be approved by a referendum.
"The constitution needs a broad consensus on the constitution.
"If the new constitutional forces, NGOs and public debate, we cannot reach a solution," he said.
Montenegro wants to join the CoE, but it needs to stop the constitution before.
In an interview with the Podgorica daily Vijesti on Wednesday, the CoE demanded that the CoE "recognition as a state" and demanded a law on civilian control over armed forces and security forces ".
Political analyst Milos Besic says that a compromise will be reached at the end of the month, but it can need for EU intervention.
"Some European institutions are likely to build a medical cine under the principle of reconciliation.
"It can be able to intervene during the negotiations," he said.

(FT, Euobserver, EurActiv, Guardian - 14 / 11 / 08; AFP, DPA, BBC, Euobserver, The European Commission - 13 / 11 / 08)
"We want European citizens to protect the risk of foreign aid to fulfil their obligations," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said. [Getty Images]
The European Commission (EC) has revealed a plan to increase energy security and efficiency of the 27-nation Union and measures to reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas imports from Russia.
About 54 per cent of the EU energy needs.
Around 61 per cent of the natural gas is imported, and Russia is funding from 42 per cent of the amount of imports.
While local gas production is expected to continue to decrease, the EC estimates that imports from 20 to 73 per cent.
The energy imports are estimated by 350 billion euros this year, and this figure means 700 euros for EU citizens, the commission said on 13 November.
EC President Jose Manuel Barroso, who presented the energy package, stressed that only 15 per cent increase in energy prices in the 27-nation bloc last year.
"We need to disappoint this part of the consumption of energy consumption and increasing imports," Barroso said.
According to Barroso, eight EU countries are completely linked to Russia on gas, the Union must be a problem.
"We need to protect European citizens to protect the risk of foreign aid to fulfil their obligations," the EC chief said.
The disputed dispute between Russia and Ukraine was cautioned by some EU countries in 2006, and the Union has asked the Union to take a step forward to further diversification of natural gas resources, energy resources and supplies.
In August, the conflict in the Caucasus repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly supported Europe.
The EU must take measures to increase energy efficiency and reduce its dependence on imports, Barroso said, calling for countries to accept new offer.
"We should invest, and we should be equal of our resources," Barroso said.

The plan emphasised that the Union needs more focused on infrastructure needs and improving energy resources, improving oil and gas supplies, improving the possible gas supplies of oil and gas supplies, the establishment of a crisis to ensure better use of local energy resources and improving energy efficiency.
The first priority in the Strategic Energy Report is to adopt measures that would allow the Union to make up the targets of 20-2020, the EC said in a statement.
The EU aims to increase its share in the final energy consumption of imports by 20 per cent to 20 per cent by 2020, wind energy, southern energy and other renewable energy resources, and increase energy efficiency of 20 per cent.
"The EU [EU]] targets will be needed in the coming years to ensure that all of the EU [20-20] targets will be done in the energy infrastructure," the EC said in a statement.
The report envisions six major strategic projects for EU energy security: the Schengen Plan connection with the South Stream pipeline, the Mediterranean gas pipeline, the Mediterranean energy pipeline, the Middle East and North South Eastern Europe, as well as natural gas supplies for the North Sea and Europe.
If the governments and the European Parliament ratified the package, the Balkan connection Plan will start next year.
The project, which includes gas, power and police issues, will connect other areas in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
The three Balkan countries, which are the most interested in Russian energy bids, are among eight EU member states that have completed natural gas needs.
The EC, which described as "one of the most important priority for EU energy security", said the project would be built on Russian oil and gas supplies to the Caspian and Middle East.
The Mediterranean pipeline, which will connect the unilateral power and gas connections to Europe, said the project is now "complete", noting the importance of developing the region ", which has the major potential for the region", which has the region ".

The EC said it would be "one of the basic goals in Europe", with the Belgium pipeline project and the Mediterranean pipeline.
The EC has pledged to use the current accounts for further progress in the six projects, noting that all sides in the third countries need to show a serious precedent for the implementation of projects.
"This study is a basic element of the EU [response] financial crisis, and must step forward to promoting employment and reducing the reduction of income," the commission said.
The EC also agreed on a series of proposals on energy efficiency, including the adoption of EU laws on construction and energy efficiency.
Citing all new buildings, the EC has asked the implementation of new efficiency standards for the current buildings of all new buildings and suggested that the implementation could provide a 5-6 per cent energy bill by 2020.
The commission has asked the Union to comply with the rules of energy arrangements -- not only the churches -- but also for more different products.
The same legal framework will be recognised as a new energy arrangements for medical cine, and pharmaceutics will be revealed, according to data.
The commission believes that consumers can reduce their quality by 10 per cent to 10 per cent.

Serbia signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU ahead of the April 2008 parliamentary elections, authorities in Belgrade have been waiting for four years to get candidate status.
The ruling coalition, led by Serbian President Boris Tadic, has been targeted as a step forward for the European integration process, but was accepted by Belgrade in February 2008, when Serbia declared independence.
Serbia removed the latest obstacle to candidacy on Thursday (March 1st) to the EU decision.
Serbian and Romanian officials have reached an agreement on the International minority in Serbia, and this is not allowing Bucharest to resume conditions.
The agreement, which includes about 30,000 people who live in the Romanian border, has not been announced.
The decision was announced by European Council President Herman Van Rompuy.
"I hope that this would encourage Serbia to boost efforts to fulfil the political and economic conditions for EU membership.
I hope that Belgrade will continue to support regional co-operation and good neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans, "he said.
Serbian officials welcomed status.
Tadic said his candidacy would open "closure", but said Serbia will be "very job" in front of steps towards EU membership.
The decision was sent to international community and foreign investors, and Serbia is "a message that Serbia is" on its path to a European country ", the head of the Serbian Parliament for European Integration, Laslo Vanga, said.
"The facility will stop the support of candidate status in the country and will create new opportunities to use money for European accession funds," he told SETimes.
However, Vladimir Radomijevic of the Strategic Studies Centre said Serbia cannot win a lot of candidacy, because the money from European funds can be used for certain projects.
"Serbia has made nothing to apply for EU candidate status, while Macedonia and Montenegro have no chance.
The worst economic situation of candidate status is unlikely and political corruption, "he said.
All parties in Serbia do not think it is a good way to join the EU.
The opposition Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), led by former Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, said that the best political will for Serbia is to stop European integration, to stop European integration and not only economic relations with the Union.
DSS spokesperson Petar Petkovic told SETimes that Serbia has lost more than 500m euros in implementing the SAA.
"Instead of EU membership, Serbia must establish a developed economic co-operation with all countries in the world," Petkovic said.
Everyone can know that Serbia is ready to start its next step towards EU membership talks, and that is the new consensus.
He believes that Serbia is a reality in December, due to the economic problems in the EU and its own part of the EU.
"It is also demanding that Belgrade will fulfil all agreements with Pristina, and that the institutions in northern Kosovo are demanded.
I do not know that the next step towards the EU will be easy, "he said.
Radomirovic also agrees.
"According to EU officials, Serbia could be able to start talks in December.
So far, the main EU countries will also require a positive step towards Kosovo, and that the Serb institutions, especially in northern Kosovo, will not be demanded. "
The citizens of Serbia 'EU candidacy have different opinions.
Milan Brkic, 33, said his candidacy is good news.
"We have closed to the EU, and this can only be better than political and political," Brkic told SETimes.
Milena Srbic, 30, is not participated.
"What will now be better?
How will we increase, more jobs?
I do not believe that the EU has great financial problems, "he said.
Serbia has given candidate status, Macedonia and Montenegro, which has the candidate status since 2005 and 2010.
Croatia is ready to join the Union in mid-2013, while Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the SAA in 2008.

Ashdown
BiH must fulfil 16 conditions before the end of June 2004, when the European Commission approved the Financial Study for Bosnia and Herzegovina and is ready to join NATO 'Partnership for Peace programme.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo -- 26 / 12 / 03
During a recent speech in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), High Representative Paddy Ashdown stressed the importance of the six countries' hopes for a possible future in the EU and NATO.
"If there is not enough progress in the second half of the year, Europe will have to be ready," Ashdown said.
The European Commission will not be a position to propose a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
The Fiscal Study is clear that this point is.
And if there is a complete road to success in the future, this point is unrealistic.
This is the reason for the coming months. "
Last month, the European Commission (EC) endorsed a Financial Information Study to assess the BiH talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the beginning of talks, which is ready to take necessary steps towards European integration.
Although BiH has made significant progress since the 1990s, it is still facing serious weaknesses.
The EC hopes that BiH has made significant progress in 16 areas that have been recognised as a priority. The SAA talks next year will propose the start of the SAA talks on the current international obligations, as well as effectively effective management of the current international obligations, effectively affecting the rule of law enforcement of human rights and the effective public administration on human rights in Europe, especially in the fight against organised crime and tax policies
The 16 requirements include a number of economic reforms in the field of rule of law, three media management, a media in the field of co-operation with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
"I am very satisfied with the member states in the next year, I am very satisfied with the proposals for the SAA talks with BiH," EU Enlargement Commissioner Chris Patten said. "I can only make it serious and progress in our areas that BiH does not recognise.
Following the local political will, there is no reason for BiH to reach this goal. "
At a meeting of the ministers' ministers, NATO welcomed BiH 'progress in recent months, when the State Assembly approved a parliamentary approval by the BiH Armed Forces and the defence reform of the BiH Armed Forces.
The Alliance now stressed that BiH must apply to the Defence Law on Defence to join the Partnership for Peace programme (PfP) at the summit in Istanbul in June 2004.
The arrest of war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic remains a key condition for membership in the PfP.
"We have many important decisions and a process that will take place in the coming days," Ashdown said at a diplomatic forum in Sarajevo earlier this month. "This is no longer that there is no need to be done in accordance with some provisions that have been defined.
This country is slow.
If BiH does not fulfil the requirements, it will be allowed to avoid this opportunity, "he said.

Following the Kosovo Mission (UNMIK) chief Michael Steiner on July 8th, Steiner is certain that Steiner will replace his own.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has not yet made it clear that the new Special Representative has been seen as Special Representative.
If Annan will use his death, UNMIK chief Charles Brammertz will be elected as head of the US president.
Steiner criticised the party in a consensus on the basic feasibility of the Kosovo status status, in which he was held two days ago.
"We know that the real philosophy is very good," Steiner said, noting that "We know that the Standard is very good," Steiner said.
During his mandate, the former UNMIK chief insisted that democracy standards should be fulfilled and created institutional institutions in the region before the final status of Kosovo.
"I think that the environment in Kosovo is completely unchanged.
"This is a clear letter to all the Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin countries that have to sign political leaders in Kosovo and urge their countries to return," he said.
"We are aware that we are doing the outcome," Steiner said.
However, I think it is very clear, and the situation is more serious, "he said.
Steiner is deeply delayed.
Portugal diplomat Jose Chairmano, Dutch policemen Jan del Ponte and Elizonia are among the candidates of Finnish diplomat Elizabeth Rehn and Italian diplomat Antonio Armabh.
According to analysts, Annan could be a candidate who is not recognised by the public.
Steiner arrived in Kosovo 17 months ago.
Some criticised the approach of the approach, while identification is a clear, independent and fair.
Steiner has worked for the establishment of the Kosovo Telecommunications Agency, a special commission that will take steps against smuggling problems and initiate the privatisation process.
Steiner also envisions the Co-operation and Criminal Tribunal for Kosovo and launched a dialogue between the Kosovo government and Kosovo Serb leaders.
However, the return of refugees and tensions in the ethnic town of Mitrovica have yet to reach a solution.
According to Steiner, the policies in Belgrade and Pristina have shown that many ethnic environmental environmental environmental circumstances in the region have repeatedly begun to complete a normal life as a multiethnic environmental environment.
Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova is a different assessment of the issue.
Rugova says that the recognition of Kosovo independence will be affected by economic developments, and that it will affect international relations and that progress in Kosovo will be made.
"We expect us to help our country in the future," Rugova said in a statement by President Hurriyet Madzer.
Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi met Steiner.
Prime Minister Rexhepi told reporters that there are a lot of work in co-operation with Steiner, despite the consequences of disputes.
"The work began at a day and the end of a day that all people have been created," Steiner said, who began his mandate at the Sevents' Foundation on 4 July.
Enver Hoxhaj, a professor of Political Science in Pristina, believes Steiner is the first major success in the Kosovo Constitution, the initiative to establish the first ethnic government.
"The approach of Steiner was reduced by tensions between the international and local environments," Hoxhaj said.
Hoxhaj added that Kosovo leaders and other minority leaders have no closer to Steiner to achieve their targets, and that the UNMIK chief is limited to many areas.
"Following pressure, pressure and tragedy in 1999, Kosovo has started to move forward on the path to a free, fair and democratic society," Steiner said in its latest report to the Security Council on July 1st.
Steiner said the participation was not yet broadcast and not yet taken place, but the basic values that would allow them to be done.

Bulgaria has decided to extend the contract with the international consortium, which is part of a new phase in the customs reform programme.
In November 2001, the Britain company was invited to assist the government to build customs administration, fulfil EU requirements and boost customs revenues.
Bulgarian Finance Minister Milen Velchev said in July that the programme is the main tasks of a 12.3m-euro contract, facilitating corruption in the customs system and facilitating legal trade.
The Anti-Corruption Report for Democracy Studies in Bulgaria, which was prepared for 2002, said the results of the Croat Australian Affairs were "unable" in the first half of the contract, adding that there are some consequences in the customs system.
They include an increase of 70 per cent year-on-year in the customs station, as well as the removal of political consensus on illegal goods.
In July 2002, Bulgaria completed the Customs Council for accession talks with the EU.
Customs revenues dropped by 1.6 billion euros in 2003, with an increase of 1.4 billion euros.
About 166m euros in June 2004, the estimates are estimated 1.8 billion euros for completion of the year.
"In the last four months of 2003, there are about 43 per cent," Velchev said.
The rise in customs revenues was transferred to the government to transport 250m euros for the social reform programme, he said.
A new 16.2m euro contract took effect on August 1st, and Bulgaria will end its EU membership bid, expected in December 2007.
"The new contract will focus on the expenditures of high risk, such as cigarette, cigarette and smoking," Velchev said.
The declaration also suggests that Bulgaria must fulfil new control mechanisms and improving current mechanisms in the framework of the requirements required by the EU to meet the new external borders.
In the second phase of the programme, the number of innovations in the first phase of the programme will be able to strengthen external control.
"The benefits of the advisory are clear.
"The investment of the Croatian Agriculture programme has been transferred to 50: 1:" It is difficult to find a successful consensus that is successful in the social service, "Velchev said.

"We are among the countries in the highest risk of risk.
This is the highest risk.
For example, Bulgaria and Romania ranked five points, Croatia is four.
We believe that Serbia is more safe than it has shown, "he said.
Jasna Matic, meanwhile, head of the foreign investment and imports agency, announced that the largest German investment award for a recent investment conference in Vienna was given to Europe to build a gasoline plant in Serbia.
In addition, the largest investor in Serbia in Serbia, the Vranc Hemofarm company, which is part of the Delta Delta Delta Holding, said it was the largest investor in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"The award is sent a positive message to investors, and the government is encouraging to continue economic reforms because it is the only way to attract new investments.
We are planning to continue our dependence on the economic development of Serbia, the government and investors, and we plan to continue our dependence on this major market, "he said.
He said the investment climate should increase dialogue between the government and investors and a investment agreement should be among the priorities of Belgrade.
According to data from the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, about 200 euros per cent of foreign investments are the last among Serbia-Montenegro countries in the region.
Election Elections in Croatia
The lawmakers in Croatia will represent two major parties in the election Sunday.
As a result, the next government will be the next coalition and the first task will be able to open Croatia 'EU bid.
By Ivana Erlis for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 20 / 11 / 03
The two main political parties in Croatia, Prime Minister Ivica Racan, and the Croatian Democratic Party (SDP) and the Croatian Democratic Union of Croatia (HDZ), are willing to approve parliamentary elections on Sunday (November 23rd).
Both parties emphasise that the country will join the EU.
Opposition polls suggest the HDZ is the main factor of the central coalition.
The HDZ, which won 20 per cent of the last polls, is ranging from 2 per cent to 9 per cent of the SDP.
Analysts say the centre-right coalition needs the support of the Croatian Charter Party, the main coalition partner in which the centre-right coalition has shown a higher participation in the elections.
Meanwhile, the Croatian People Party (HNS), a other coalition member, has made it clear that it would seek to form a coalition with SDP.
However, the HNS has decided to join some small political parties, as it wants to be independent.
This could lead to the division of the vote.
If any party victory, the next government will be the next government and the main task will be to enter the EU.
Croatia, which began its application for EU membership in February, hopes to start talks with Bulgaria and Romania to join the bloc in 2007.
However, Croatia has been dangerous due to its failure to arrest retired General Ante Gotovina, indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal, indicted by at least 150 ethnic Serbs during the 1991-1995 war crimes tribunal.
Croatia will co-operate with the EU on full co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
The EU has made it clear that Croatia expects Gotovina to extradite Gotovina to The Hague.
HDZ President Ivo Sanader said his party is more different than the party during the war. "Everything will be able to co-operate with the UN tribunal" on General Gotovina.
In addition, Sanader also called for the Serbs to return.
The opponents see the HDZ moves as part of election action.
Some warn that the party will continue to establish the party &aposs party, which would represent the past.
The selection is different: the HDZ is in power, and the current coalition has not been tried in power.
The fifth victory against the Central coalition in January 2000 was a turning point in the country &aposs political life.
Racan and coalition partners have vowed to turn Croatia into a full integration into Europe, while economic stability will be transformed into a stable democracy.
Following the ruling coalition, however, the coalition has made it clear that there is no exception.
The previous regime has been criticised by criticising the criticism due to the lack of unemployment in 18.3 per cent in September.
The Racan government has sparked support for the Croatian citizens, causing the central coalition to convince support.
The HDZ, meanwhile, has been able to strengthen the organisation.

Since January 1st, Macedonian authorities are aiming to criticise the law on smuggling smuggling in public areas, which has been implemented since January 1st.
"Therefore, there is a law for high money, but there is a decrease of punishment," he told Southeast European Times in Skopje.
Experts warn that the number of employees in the winner could be reduced.
About 17,000 people live in Macedonia, or more than 17,000 restaurants.
Oden Cigovski, head of the Macedonian Caucasus and Rights Service Foundation, said several businesses will be sold for a 24-hour protest on Friday.
The move wants to change the law to allow smoking and unanimous parts of smoking, and is trying to discuss authorities to find a solution.
However, the government does not change its position.
"Macedonia is not the first country that has decided to implement the law on smuggling in public areas and will not be in the last country," Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Pesevski said.
The citizens' law are being considered.
The government has established 1350-pieces of restaurants, cafes and schools, and only two violations in Kumanovo and Gostivar.
The board was sentenced to money for violations, and the businesses were injured.
The parallel punishment is 150-300, businesses, 255-400m euros.
The law could be closed until 30.
Prosecutors and local government agencies gathered 88 textbooks and a single violation.
However, "smoking" gave 19 hundreds of injuries because they have not been formed ".
"The law should not be changed and change," Skopje resident Zoran Stefanovski told SETimes. "I don [I] did not see a restaurant with the families, and I am convinced that there is no reason to do so.
"It should not be allowed to be allowed to smoking in the cities where people do not get."
Those who believe the law is more participating.
Aleksandar Pankova believes the European laws "must be warning" local parliament and that the government should not allow smugglers in smuggling.
"If there will be a couple for smoking, smokers can decide whether to enter such peacekepers," he said.
Opposition lawmakers Vlado Buckovski and Gordan Orovic have started sign a procedure in parliament to change the law.
"We think that this law is no longer restriction, but we think that we have no restrictions," Buckovski said, referring to the model, which allows them to apply for smoking for smuggling for smuggling and businesses to apply smoking in businesses. "We believe that Macedonia should be implemented," he said
New Kosovo strategy targets criticism
A new approach to northern Kosovo was criticised by Serbian representatives.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 18 / 01 / 10
"It is a strong, fair and multiethnic legal institutions for all communities," EULEX chief Yves Kermabon said. [Getty Images]
According to local media reports, the Kosovo government and the International Civilian Corporation (ICO) have criticised the criticism of a new approach and strategy of a new approach for the northern part of Kosovo.
The strategy envisions the establishment of a North Mitrovica municipality by mid-year.
The plan envisions a local elections in three northern municipalities, including the Kosovo government, Zvecan, Leavic and Zubin Potok.
According to Pristina, the new approach will help the Serb structures operating in this part of Kosovo, and that EULEX envisions the presence of EULEX.
"It is strong, fair and multiethnic legal institutions for all communities.
It will be the safety of a judge and will be very important, "he said.
De Kermabon said the main priority of EULEX would be to resume the Kosovo Serb and Albanian judges and prosecutors to the Mitrovica District Court, and that the justice will be able to promote a multiethnic and single judiciary.
"Another in Europe is the same and the two judiciary in the same way.
The two judges will have to cause the judiciary and will be able to convince people against the rights of their rights.
The only judiciary in Kosovo can be a single judiciary, "he said.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci voiced support for the new strategy.
"The establishment of the rule of law on all Kosovo territorial integrity is also meant to avoid restrictions that have not recognised the institutions and laws of Kosovo," Thaci said.
The new plan aims to improve the economic situation in the region, he added.
"Technology has four main areas: strengthening the rule of law, strengthening the rule of law, decentralisation and new municipalities in northern Mitrovica, the problem of local governments in the three northern municipalities, and improving the economic situation in this part of Kosovo."
According to Serbian National Council of Northern Kosovo Milan Ivanovic, however, Serbs want to remain in the constitution and legal system.
Therefore, the new plan will cause stability in the north.
"The strategy of UNMIK, which aims to work in the 1244 Contact Group, has been extradited from UNMIK to Kosovo, is a group of countries that have created independent Kosovo, and should not be able to resolve the final solution, such as the [final] elections in Mitrovica," Ivanovic said.
Serbian President Boris Tadic told Glas Srbije that the Kosovo issue is not closed for Serbia.
Belgrade wants to seek a compromise with Kosovo Albanians to find a "reconciliation" in Kosovo.
Tadic emphasised that Serbia "will not recognise Kosovo", but also stressed that "Kosovo Albanians are not going to stop their lives."
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu told the World Relations Council on January 12th that Kosovo has faced "challenges in the north, which is supported by Belgrade".
"There is a lot of people in these structures.
They have people in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.
"It will be difficult to stop stability in this part of the part of Kosovo, which has been transferred to a region of human trafficking," he said.

The new mechanisms prepared by the National Bank of Serbia are expected to raise this explosion.

In recent years, financing companies in Serbia are increasingly increasing their jobs.
In this case, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) is forced to find new mechanisms.
The Finnish refinery industry has become a huge life for businesses and companies.

The Serbs who have been punished for years and economic stalemate have been punished for such goods, while the Serbs have been punished in the long term, and they are unable to disrupt the majority in the long term.
According to official data, the Serbian financing market 'office was 220m euros in the first ten months of 2004.
This is the lowest of the amount of amounts to four points in the first six months of 2003, when this funding is the first in the country.
According to new amendments, financing companies are needed to invest in NBS, while the institutional financing should be done in a couple of days.
All participants will be the Central Bank and financing companies, which will be able to sell up to 100,000 euros, will have to have a serious plan for future commercial activities.
Most consumption will not be able to finance consumption -- only 2,000 euros will not be allowed to be allowed to be allowed for the average salary in Serbia -- and the general consumption will not be allowed to be allowed to be allowed to be allowed for the quality of poor and medical products.
The transportation sector is the first stake in this exchange.
The average salary in Serbia is on the ground or commercial cards, while the economy will also require new vehicles to the EU.
NBS officials, however, insist that the aim of new rules is not forced to do their citizens, but also from funding.
In addition, authorities say, the consumers signed all requirements for consumption, while many are optimistic about the programme.
"We are convinced that the consumption of consumers will be able to fulfil all the conditions for the consumption of consumption in the first five years," NBS Director Dejan Simic said.
Finnish firms claim that this would increase services.
They say that this is not the only reason for the Central Bank, but they can offer better conditions to invest in the bank.

Bulgaria and Romania attended the special session of the parliament, Georgi Parvanov and Traian Basescu, as well as Greek opposition leaders Karolos Papoulias.
Members of the three seats in parliament have supported the two countries' agreements.
Only 30 years ago, the Communist Party voted for the same reason for Greece 'membership.
Therefore, Greece, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovenia and Cyprus were the fifth EU member states to ratify the agreement signed in Luxembourg on 25 April.
The document must be approved by all EU countries by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Latvia and Lithuania by the end of this year to be approved by all EU countries to join the Union.
Earlier this month, the European Commission (EC) warned Bulgaria and Romania that their membership must speed up the necessary reforms to implement a year.

The conference, held in Brussels on 9 November, rejected a deal on Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia -- on the free trade zone for Southeast Europe.
Since December 19th, the countries will risk the risk of a market, including 40m people.
The current Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) is planning to replace the city of 331 bilateral agreements, which will enable Albania, BiH, Croatia, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro and Kosovo.
The deal is very important for EU enlargement in the region.
"It is not a precondition of co-operation," Stability Pact chief Erhard Busek said last week. "The success is not a precondition of improvement, but also the development of the market.
"We want to see competitiveness from the region, and we need to open European markets through regional co-operation."
BiH and Serbia oppose a variety of agreements with the current public.
Sarajevo, Croatia and Serbia are seeking to ensure that products from Croatia and Serbia will be removed.
In addition, bilateral contracts signed with the two countries are hoping to adopt the law as a unilateral and unilateral.
Following a bilateral agreement on enhancing Croatia and Serbia to protect the customs protection of goods and water products, BiH has been protected.
Authorities decided to meet restrictions with farmers.
The main stage of Serbia is on the ground that Croatia and all industrial industrial industries are in line with Croatia.
Both countries have closely closed markets with a comprehensive approach.
The Croatian producer Rovinj factory is protecting 38% of its customs duties.
Serbia, meanwhile, is being implemented by a small tax (15%), but is protected by Philip Morris and the British American Tobacco, with high consumers of the factory in Philip Morris and Vranje.
Foreign Affairs Minister Milen Parvanov said he will soon visit Zagreb to a bid to find a solution.
Prosecutors argue the principal principles of protecting customs barricades are facing the CEFTA, and free trade advocates say they will help the country in the long term.
The economies of BiH and Serbia have no competitiveness in the region, which will be completed in 2010.
This will be open to global competitiveness pressure.

"If we are acceptable conditions are acceptable, we cannot be possible to achieve progress," the AFP quoted Erdogan as saying Tuesday.
Ankara has signed a protocol to expansion the bloc, including the new members of the bloc, including Cyprus, which has signed its accession talks with Brussels in October 2005.
The Greek Cypriots, which represents the completion of the island of Cyprus and the EU, joined the bloc in May 2004, only a few days after Greek Cypriots rejected the UN plan to reunify them with Turkish Cypriots in the north.
The agreement was accepted by the majority of the Turkish Cypriots recognised by Ankara, but it was not acceptable to the bloc.
Despite its obligations as part of the customs protocol, Turkey refused to allow Greek Cypriots and airports to join the airport.
At the same time, the country insists that the EU has insisted that the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community is being implemented.
The Finnish, which aims to end this stalemate, would allow Turkish Cypriot and airports to join the airports and airports, while the Famagushta committee in northern Cyprus proposed a compromise that will open trade with the 25-nation bloc.
At the same time, the village of Vienna will return to former Greek Cypriot residents and be allowed to live.
According to the Turkish Daily News, however, Finnish 'proposal would allow the Ergenekon airport to open international organisations in the Turkish part of Cyprus.
The ruling Justice and Development Party will have a major political risk in the next year 'general elections, the British newspaper said.
Gul, who was scheduled to visit Finland on Sunday, said Ankara does not refuse the Fund plan and said the proposal "is on the way to discuss".
"The presidency is taking part, and we are supporting these efforts," Gul said Tuesday. "We are still at large."

Bulgaria said on Tuesday that the EU should encourage countries to boost the project, which joined the Nabucco gas pipeline.

Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Italy signed energy agreements. [Reuters]
Bulgaria urged the EU on Tuesday (November 30th) to ensure that the Nabucco gas pipeline project is important for the Union, urging member states to ensure that they are able to see their budget deficit.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov told a conference on energy sector in Southeast Europe that Sofia is a priority of Nabucco.
"However, I think that the work is a priority for the project and the project is a priority for the EU," Borisov said. "I think that the countries in Nabucco will give up the European Investment Bank for Investment and Development and Development of the European Bank for Reconstruction."
The 8-billion-euro pipeline is the EU 'initiative of the South Stream Corridor and aims to reduce its dependence on the 27-nation bloc.
The project will transport natural gas from the Caspian region and Central Asia from Bulgaria, Romania, Romania and Hungary to Europe, as well as natural gas from the Caspian region and Asia.

"I will not stop the project, but we should all see that we will open us," the Bulgarian prime minister warned.
Bulgaria did not participate in the 2011 budget for Nabucco, which is prevented by 2.5% of GDP.
Therefore, the EU will resume its request to facilitate the financial facilitation for member states, but the Balkan country will ratify 3% of GDP, which is set for countries in the bloc.
Meanwhile, members of the European Parliament (MERB), the central Bulgarian centre-right Party for European Development (GERB), emphasised on Tuesday that Nabucco must become a real priority for the EU.
"Nabucco should be accepted as a priority for the division of energy resources in Europe," the GERB MEP said in a statement in Brussels.
"The project will guarantee a significant amount of gas, and will encourage EU citizens to promote competitiveness in the European gas market, and will remove their energy deficits in Bulgaria and the EU."

European officials are urging Romania and Bulgaria to make real progress in reform in the judicial system, under which the European Commission (EC) is under way to join the 25-nation Schengen zone.
The latest and final call was from French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
"I know that the commission is working with Romania and Bulgaria.
"I expect that this process will end," he said.
The stance of his country is also shared by Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, he said.
"We will participate in that [Schengen] will be resolved," Sarkozy said.
He also urged the two countries to strengthen their borders before joining the region.
"If the two countries are able to grant their citizens of Moldova, the European borders will be waiting for European borders. This means that they need to be resolved before membership.
"If the problem is resolved -- for example, Roma and Moldova -- the problem of all Schengen countries will become a problem," he said.
Sarkozy 'remarks were also in other environmental areas in Europe.
The new ruling coalition between the Liberals and Christian Democrats in the Netherlands has agreed that Romania and Bulgaria have made progress in the judiciary.
"In Europe, the government, Romania and Bulgaria will defend the Schengen assessment of the two years in the two countries' report on corruption and judicial reform.
If the countries have not met the final criteria, the Netherlands will not support full membership in the Schengen, and Bulgaria and Bulgaria will not support its border crossings in the EU and will not be acceptable to Bulgaria and Romania, "the report said.
The head of the Socialist group in the European Parliament, Martin Schwarzz, was from Martin School. He said that France and Germany could oppose their participation in the two countries' accession, due to concerns about the problems of illegal immigrants and other parts of the EU.
"I am very high, the possibility of membership is likely to submit a vote in 2011," the Bulgarian state said.
Romanian Justice Minister Catil Prediou, who faces a consensus in Europe, urged Bucharest to show more efforts.
"We believe that Romania must support its prosecutors to continue its Schengen accession bid, as well as a unique and unstable.
Membership is that the European partners have the capacity to have any chance in border control because of the Schengen procedures, "he said.
Meanwhile, the EC says the Schengen membership is evaluated by the criteria that are set to be set up.
"MCVAT and membership talks are the two parallel process," European Commission Enlargement Commissioner Cecilia Malststststststock said last week.
Romanian analysts feel sales.
"In recent months, Bucharest has been very difficult to establish MCV, but the EC report shows that it is weakened because Romania has been criticised for the justice sector," Cristian Cristian Ciuca, director of the Romanian daily Libera, told SETimes.
"Sarkozy supports the Schengen membership bid, and the two countries' goal is to become a stable future.
"Even more important than the French leader warns that the government can decide whether the next EC report will be released next summer."

The Macedonian chief prosecutor has investigated that former President Branko Crvenkovski has been used for a PPR strategy "by former President Branko Crvenkovski" and that the public does not use the money.
At the same time, Crvenkovski, leader of the opposition SDSM party, claims that the tax, which is planning to provide strategic recommendations for the end of the time, has spent 340,000 euros.
Observers say Crvenkovski has not taken the right legal procedures with Slovenian experts, and that "the initiative" Ukrat "is doing many facilities for normal PR.
The plan is said to be said to have attacked the government of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, where Crvenkovski was simply dismissed.
"We criticised the case for the accordance as a part of organised crime," said Jusuevski, head of the Prosecutor Organisation for Prosecutors' Prosecutor 'Organised Crime. "We have not rejected the possibility of the investigation [long-term] cabinet members."
The investigation is expected to be nearly a month.
Prosecutors say that the Criminal Tribunal for the Criminal Tribunal for the Criminal Tribunal for the purchase of Crvenkovski to open the public public tender for the purchase of 353.
If the indictment is indicted, Crvenkovski could be sentenced to four years in prison.
The case won a boycott in the region, when Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor rejected allegations against the incident.
Ana Deneva, head of the SDSM central committee, claimed Pahor 'experts have proposed us to Crvenkovski.
Pahor said there was no response.
"We have not sent advisory to former President Branko Crvenkovski and we expect a statement from the Macedonian Social Democratic Union," he said.
Crvenkovski voiced regret that the Slovenian prime minister was "unacceptable", saying the Slovenian prime minister was quoted as saying.
He described it as a "disappointed initiative".
The SDSM said there is no reason for the former state president.
"President Branko Crvenkovski [tax]] is completely completely spent for personal and party interests.
The funds have been split with public research, public research and consultations on Macedonia 'strategic strategy in the EU and NATO, "he said.
He also announced that he would open the local Sitel TV station, including Slovenian experts in 1996, which has issued various allegations, including allegedly pay for money.
Professor and analyst Dimitrir Mircev told SETimes that the UK plan is more concerned about legal mechanisms.
"Crvenkovski has tried to win a stable and unfair rhetoric of the government.
Authorities in the UK plan have been used for improving the state and the international image, but they are not used for the personal image, "he said.

The Communist regime has been seeking to overcome the territorial integrity over the past five years, and also tried to tackle these problems.
However, the fall of communism and the transition process has started, with tensions in the society.
The Romanian media, which began a new growth, was also sparked. In 1991, it was killed by a Roma village near Bucharest.
This murdered the murders of Roma in the village, and the Roma were given their homes.

The current account for that.
However, there is a lot of need for change.
Of course, co-operation between countries should be improved and resolved.
We can work in this conclusion.
EU accession should not be a joint model for all countries.

In Turkey, the positive steps towards reforms have been made and the first step towards the implementation of the necessary steps can be seen as clear.
Instead, it is not enough, but the process is necessary.
Some European countries, however, emphasise, emphasised the reality of the future.
We know the Copenhagen criteria.
Greece wants to see that road is completed.
Since the plans, it is not the first time of a date for everything in December, but a new relationship.

Both sides are working in this conclusion that the European perspective will speed up a better future for everyone.
As a member of the European family, Greece supports Turkey on the road to Europe, as a key candidate, Turkey is seeking to join the EU.
Nevertheless, we should not have a lot of problems in our relations.
SE Times: We are uncertain in talks on resolving the Cyprus issue.
How do you see this issue?
What is optimistic about the outcome?

A European solution to the Cyprus issue will affect Turkish relations.

In an exclusive interview with SETimes, Mitic assessed security and ethnic issues in the Middle East, and revealed the opinion on the future relations with Kosovo.
SETimes: Two years after Pristina accepted the Ahtisaari plan for broadcasting broad autonomy and protection measures for the Serb minority, Kosovo Serbs have said they are not aware that they can live in a safe situation in Kosovo and are unlikely to be completely negative.
How do you think?
Danijela Mitic: The security situation in Kosovo is very important.
Most Kosovo Serbs can be able to liberalise.
They arrive in Pristina and are increasing in Kosovo institutions, especially as part of the decentralisation process.
There is a lot of concerns about the problem.
For example, UNDP polls show that Kosovo Serbs are doing to the media, and they want to see more local media.

I think that all investigations have the capacity to be investigated.
SETimes: How will KFOR troops will protect Serbs in the communities?
Mitic: There is no other reason for KFOR security, and I think there are some benefits such as small society.
However, I am not convinced that I do not want to see in the streets, as they are reluctant.
"We are not aware of the truth.
I see this as progress.
SETimes: How do you think that many Serbs in South and central Kosovo plan to transform the country?
Mitic: I think the decisions are not a reason for politicians.
Zaman is changed and people are changing.
People are seeking better life.
But, as I say, more Serbs have decided to stop.

The BNE government has called on the government to decide on this issue as a consultation board of companies, such as the Centorica, Merkel Lynch, London Stock Exchange, KPG and energy management board.

Romanian President Traian Basescu said that hundreds of hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of people who will be able to speed up the EU market.
"Special companies have been explosives, and Romania is doing a climate in the construction sector.
"We believe that the Romanian market will be encouraging, so we believe the immigration will not be a problem," he said.
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin said Bulgaria will not have a threat to the British market after the country joined the EU, saying it would not be a threat to British markets.

UN Secretary-General Milosevic Puses for Reconstruction in Srebrenica

A former UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, a former commander of the UN war crimes tribunal in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), said the possibility of "a tragedy" that Slobodan Milosevic is a permanent part of the conflict in Srebrenica in March 1993.
The former Yugoslav Presidency has used a possible massacre on Bosnian Serb leaders in May, wrote French General Philippe Morrion said on Thursday (February 12th) in the war crimes trial of Milosevic.
Milosevic faces a total of 66 war crimes charges against three different indictments against Croatia, BiH and Kosovo during the 1990s.
It also includes a single genocide over the 1992-1995 Srebrenica massacre, including 7,500 Muslim men and boys.
UN prosecutors who must complete the indictment against Milosevic next week have control the Serb forces in BiH, so they are trying to prove that they are responsible for their actions.
Milosevic insists that Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are not responsible for war crimes in BiH.
Morrion, a commander of the UN peacekeeping force in BiH from September 1992 to July 1993, dismissed the situation.
"This is the same time," he said.
People are something about the public, which is taking action.
"It is not only the women, but the women 'completion of this population," he said. "It is no longer protected, not only the perpetrators of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"It was a unprecedent."
During his visit to the Srebrenica massacre in eastern BiH in March 1993, Moravon was detained with barricades, and the Bosnian Serb units have started to stay on food and flexibility.
He promised that the UN will protect them, but the Muslim forces have insisted that the attacks against Serb civilians were sparked.
"I know that the only person can help me is Milosevic, and I revealed the situation," he said.
He urged the Yugoslav leader to withdraw their soldiers, warning that there will be "no reason" in Srebrenica if the commissioner does not stop the attacks.
"We will be disappointed and will be declared," he said.
According to Morrion, Milosevic has been in connection with Karadzic and Mladic since May 1993, when a possible massacre of Belgrade was removed.
Milosevic said this should be a time.
"I hope that there could be a political effect, and this is the way for the internal culture.
Everything has been stalled, but is a question, "he said.
"It is a question," he said.
He said the protectors were returned two years after the Bosnian Serb forces ended in July 1995, and that Muslim men and boys are still unable to participate in the area, which was declared by the UN, which was declared by Bosnian Serb forces.

Kosovo, Albanian history Employed Ottoman Employment
The history of the Ottoman Employment of the Ottoman Empire is a significant effect on relations with Kosovo and Albania.
By Muhamet Brajshori for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 25 / 07 / 11
Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu faces problems with Kosovo and Albanian history. [Reuters]
In its historic history with nationalists in Kosovo and Albania, the Ottoman Employment and some in some cases, Turkey has been seriously criticised by the Ottoman government of about five years.
They argue, however, that the nationalist movement could create a long-term effect in relations with Turkey.
The Ottoman Employment and the historic history on Turkey is reflected by the Albanian nationalist nationalism, Bazexhi told SETimes that the Ottoman Employment has started and reflected an effective judge by the Albanian nationalist regime, which continues to continue and developed different developments.
"The presence of all these phases shows Europe as Turkey, and this is part of the Islamic community since September 11th," Jazexhi said.
A historic history for schools in Kosovo is the impact of Islam on the Ottoman period.
"The main factors affected the Islamic broadcast are that only Christians are being implemented in Istanbul, ensuring the children 'children' children 'children' families' children 'children' children 'battle and the Islamic education of the state," he said.
In this statement, the Ottoman Empire is a country of business in Albania and Kosovo and another issue between experts and historians.
Jazz Ottoman nationalism argues that Albanian nationalist historians see their territory as a major Albania, but also warns.
"Ottomans are not Turkish, and most Albanians are not the same.
The Ottoman Employment and the Albanian Muslims were built in Europe, "he said.
It also reflects the Turkish Cypriots as part of the Ottoman monastery, which is part of the Ottoman monument, which is part of a scale and smaller Albanian village.
"A Ottoman tradition will not be an Ottoman tradition," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in a statement in Sarajevo in 2009, adding that "A Ottoman will not be able to see Albanian lives."
However, history Dimitris Koci reflects the nationalism and believes there is no need for a historic reunification.
"Ottoman territory of our Albanian territory is a reality," he said, arguing that "If there is no changes in the history, there is no need for any changes or historic reunification," he argued. "It is a rising risk of our national identity."
However, it could affect the "strategic consensus" of the Turkish foreign policy in the region, which has been defended by Davutoglu and advised by Turkey 'joint history and cultural donations, and that Turkey' common history could be used to increase its influence in the region.
For instance, widespread writer Nikola Ukaj is "detailed" with Kosovo and Turkey.
"Our wartime over the past decade is that we have frozen," he wrote. "How will we have our relationship in the world that we have repeatedly returned to the rest of our unrest?" he says.
Jazexhi warns that the negative image of Ottoman could have a credibility over Turkey &aposs ethnic Albanians in the long term.
"Currently, Turkey is now under the current policy that Ahmet Davutoglu wants to start friendly relations with people in the Balkans and wants to start date.
However, after a few years, I think that Turks will likely start to change their position on Albanian interests. "

Despite the general elections, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is still a new government because political parties are still facing disagreements over the BiH Council of Ministers' finances.
At the end of the political conflict, the two parties -- Zlatko Lagumdzija -- the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Milorad Dodik 'Democratic Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) -- have come to the government.
In addition, the SDP candidate and Council of Ministers' Council of Ministers Slavko Kukic failed to support the delegation.
Most RS parties voted in Kukic, as well as members of the HDZ and HDZ Party of BiH, led by Haris Silajdzic.
Kukic supported more than half of the deputies in the first and second round on July 29th and July 14th, but the BiH Council of Ministers did not support a third of the required RS lawmakers in the constitution.
"Everything about the basis is is reflects part of the BiH political scenario, and that the state will be able to choose the mandate as early as.
BiH has visited a major process to fulfil its mandate by the EU, if it is not possible to make progress in the Euro-Atlantic process, "he said.
Mladjan Ivanic, head of the Democratic Progress Party (PDP), says that the parties are not interested in the government.
"I do not know that the state government will be formed by the end of the year," Ivanic told SETimes.
Ivanic believes the state government will not be formed until the state budget is forced to reach an agreement with Lagumzija and Dodik.
"We expect serious economic problems and serious financing by the end of the year.
We can expect a serious controversial debate on the establishment of a new loan to BiH, so we can expect the government to discuss the establishment of a new loan, "he said.
However, political analyst Tanja Topic believes the latest talks would be established soon.
He says the leaders are not a simple to find a solution on the new government, but the political crisis must find a way.
According to Topic, the SDP is the highest rising risk in the elections, and the principles do not have a lot of information on the principles, because BiH has lost its future.
"We have to find a compromise between the SDP, HDZ and SNSD to form a new government, so that BiH has lost 10 months, and it will be the question that it was not reached after the elections," Topic told SETimes.

"At the same time, BiH 'political conservative is being subject to the political crisis as a normal, while the political crisis is" very serious to protect the interests of national reforms &quot
"I think that the authorities have no evidence from the report are very satisfied.
Relations in BiH, especially in Republika Srpska, are willing to be easy, "he said.
"I am convinced that BiH will not be able to join the EU more than ten years," according to Sarajevo commentator Sejad Pecanin.
According to Pecanin, some of the questionnaire faces the need to fight the economic framework if the citizens are not able to decide on this issue.
According to Observers from Brussels, the citizens are more effective, and they are no longer pressure on political will.
"If the people do not know how much they can live, EU membership is a issue that will not pressure on the public 'power," he said.
Nevertheless, citizens told SETimes, however, are unwilling to stay on the prospects of change.
"All regional countries are in BiH," Haris Halilovic, a widespread meeting. "The process of national interests and civilian rights is not in this country, but the process is not achieved."

EU security chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called on Monday (December 12th) to establish a EU force that will play a major role in the province, including police structures in the province after the final status of Kosovo.
The report described the idea of a EU police mission as the first time in June, when the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea.
The document presented EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday to discuss EU enlargement prospects.
"The EU can be responsible for police and the rule of law," Reuters quoted the report as saying. "A possible ESDP [for police and the rule of law] should be initiated to launch a possible mandate for security and defence [mission] for police and the rule of law."
At the same time, the two officials urged the bloc to help strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo, judges, judges and prison personnel, to strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo and to reduce the unemployment rate of 50 per cent in the province.
However, Rehn and Solana emphasised that the bloc is not willing to complete the mandate of the UN mission, which is currently under the rule of law and the management of civil administration in the province.
Authorities said the bloc will not create a "EUFOR".
Authorities also warned that the EU 'role in Kosovo is likely to have a major and greatest mandate in the bloc, which has been causing tensions in the bloc so far.
"As part of the EU [future] international presence, any provisions that will be established in order to implement the status agreement should be created, as well as for a ESDP funding for the police and the rule of law," EU officials urged the ministers to provide enough funds to ensure that the budget.
The financial effect will likely be assessed by EU leaders, who have not reached an agreement on the long-term financing of the bloc.
The current stalemate has created a effect on the Balkan policy, while the EU seems to see the decision on the status of Macedonia as a result of the budget concerns over its candidate status.
However, Rehn told reporters on Friday that the Union would not participate in the province because Kosovo "is important for stability in the Western Balkans".
In its report, Rehn and Solana suggested that the status issue should be a European pace for Kosovo, without resolving the status issue.
However, officials also noted that the role of the EU will focus on the status talks that the ethnic Albanian majority would have to be removed in a way of full independence, with demands of sovereignty of Serbia.

The Serbian police union has been seeking better conditions and salaries, while strikes began last week.
Police are also seeking to increase the salary, as well as a new committee, organised crime and new universities.

Mijovic said he has been warning that the scandal has no supervision of police officers in the past two years.
"Despite a new approach, all police officers are not revealed," Mijovic said.
While the head of the media has been defined, he said there is no way for strikes.
Serbian Interior Ministry data shows that police officers are between 350 euros and 400 euros.
The security service should have around 59,000 workers in normal and standards, while 45,000 employees are under way.
There are more than 1,000 police officers in Belgrade.
The Serbian Police Union has around 15,000 members.
They also demanded the government to change the police law.
Mijovic said the scandal wants the government to establish the police workers' system, because it would not be widespread in 2012.
He also demands a lack of wage for work.

Police Director Milorad Veljovic believes the scandal is the only and demands.
"The state is the importance of preserving police security.
Police preserve all army and administrative border crossings and are urging them to protect security and security, "he said.

In Albania, the Socialist Party has passed a parliamentary boycott last month after protests and strike strikes in two years, but the lack of insufficient and delay.
In a report released last month, the European Commission (EC) suggested that Albania has not proposed EU candidate status for many reforms.
The EC noted that the SP 'parliamentary boycott contributed to slowdown in reforms, while the opposition is responsible for the government.
"The reforms to boost democratic standards, Albania is a priority for democracy," SP MP Ditmir Baati told SETimes.
However, the SP said it does not mean that the government is sent to parliament, and that the law has been sent to parliament.
"Our task is not to work on the parliamentary statistics on the law on the law," SP Vice-President Silimir Tahiri told SETimes.
We want to move forward and this is a real parliamentary initiative that will transform EU recommendations to a concrete working plan, "he said.
The opposition submitted a preliminary proposal on the government reform -- such as the ombudsman and central bank manager -- to reconciliate a compromise on both parties.
"Our task is not working, but the Albanian people are trying to work for real solutions," Tahiri said.
However, the party has repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly supported the government reform, but the SP does not have strong support for reforms.
According to former SP leader Fatmir Nano, the party is not serious in efforts to reform.
"There is no image [for]," Nano said.
Meanwhile, Aleksandar Cipa said the divisions in the party would affect the party 'ability.
"The opposition, led by the Rama leader, is a position that the lack of good and free movement is clear," Cipa told SETimes.
"The problem is that the decision to return to the parliament is unhappy.
These are a disease and intelligence, such as the SP administration, "he said.
"The opposition has taken the image of the country, reforms and [EU] integration process," he said.
Nevertheless, the end of the boycott is believed to have more to the political stalemate in Albania.
"Opposition is very important: democratic dialogue will be able to return to parliament, and the streets will be transferred to parliament," journalist Mustafa Nano told SETimes.
However, Nano said, the situation could be a positive side.
"A number of laws that need to compromise both parties will be approved because of a number of laws, Mladic and foreign pressure.
However, this is not a small smaller, because the majority and the opposition will remain the same. "

Since January 1st, Montenegro has the right to exercise liberalisation of EU member states.
So far, however, the amount of widespread expenditures has been dismissed.

According to Index president Slobodan Mandic, there will be 30,000 tonnes of weapons this year.
This year, 29,000 tonnes of passengers are facing 36.
Nevertheless, the real risk of the fall is under the figure.

In order to resolve this problem, the Rivivo is planning to implement a series of projects aimed at boosting the capacity of production and concerts.
Among them, there is a huge farm.

Meanwhile, the Montenegrin Ministry of Agriculture has allocated 97,000 euros for development of this year.
According to Marko Kokin, head of the Association of professional Relations, the biggest problem is not a major development strategy.
According to Kapin, Montenegro is currently at 1.5m euros per year, but some fears that they are not able to pay the amount of exports, but some of the bonds that have been used to buy the amount of money.
At the same time, Montenegro is facing obstacles such as high prices and insufficient insufficiency.
Even though more than 30,000 tonnes are possible, representatives of the wealth sector warn that this figures would mean expenditures.
In addition, Montenegro must find local markets.
Although Italy is a delay of delay, the female transportation problems working to the Belgrade market -- could be able to reach 48 hours in the capital.
The wealthy exports in Montenegro are still under way, while all sides agree that they need to evaluate the potential of the industrial sector, research and environmental projects to find their use by the end of the year.

Delevic: reforms need for Serbia 'interests
The head of the country &aposs European Integration Opposition, says more than EU membership is under risk.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 05 / 09 / 11

Serbia was one of the most important obstacles to EU membership with Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
The process, however, could be more complicated than Serbs' future.
As part of the reform laws, there are many expectations that are expected to meet.
Meanwhile, some EU leaders -- particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- have made progress in bilateral talks with Kosovo, and the need to resolve the disputes on the north of Kosovo.
A recent researcher by the government of Europe and the European Integration Opposition shows that the number of citizens who support EU membership in a possible referendum is a rise of four points.
This is 57 per cent, and 53 per cent today.
Belgrade claims that the European Commission will be released on October 12th, when it is ready to become an official candidate for Serbia.
Milica Delevic, head of the European Integration Opposition for Integration, dismissed questions about the general situation.
SETimes: How do you think that Serbian citizens are satisfied with the support of the country ’ s European integration process?
Milica Delevic: The public is not an optimistic idea of talks on the EU, but the high level of support is that Serbia will benefit for EU membership, as well as for both countries.
NATO membership is a matter of protecting Serbia. [Reuters]
Current support is now high.
Our support for reforms is more important to support for EU membership.
Officials believe that reforms should be implemented, not for the EU, but for our own job, about 73 per cent earlier this month.
I hope that our citizens will continue to move forward to European integration, the process is crucial that the citizens want to see the reforms they want to see their citizens.
SETimes: The possibility of recognition of Serbia &aposs EU membership is a controversial issue of hundreds of thousands of political environmental environmental resources in Europe and Serbia.
What is the truth?
Delevic: Serbia is moving in the framework of stability and enlargement process, and the conditions are being taken into account, and the implementation of the democratic principles of human and minority rights, democratic principles of the rule of law, a functioning market economy and the EU legal heritage of the EU.
As part of the first criteria, regional co-operation is a special example of fulfilling the obligations from our entity to international agreements.
Kosovo could not be seen as an official date, but it may be a reality of the political climate that will open the process in both Serbia and the EU.
In the EU, there is no idea that Kosovo is not a state, but it is clear that all Kosovo should participate in regional co-operation and partnership with the EU.
SETimes: One of the issues in the Serbian political scene is that NATO membership is a precondition for EU membership.
How do you see this issue?
Delevic: The majority of EU member states are also members in NATO, but some are not very active to the entity.
Serbia is ready to take responsibility for regional and global security, and advisory relations with NATO, the Alliance must be opposed to NATO, while the Alliance is facing differences between the Alliance.
Ratko Mladic is also tried to The Hague tribunal because of Srebrenica genocide and other war crimes suspects. [Reuters]
SETimes: Serbia hopes to win a positive response from the EC on 12 October.
Do you need Serbia to do so?
Delic: I believe that Serbia needs to do this issue and I believe that it will be done until the European Commission decision on candidate status is announced on October 12th.
However, the candidate country is to see its candidate status as a reason to change everything.
This decision will be a assessment that we are under way in some reforms, and the Commission will have some specific laws that will be implemented as soon as possible, and the Commission will see how the laws are implemented.
Serbia is widespread to expect it to become a complex country until its history.
Currently, the most important thing is to show a symbolic effort to make a positive race as the EC assesses.
The assessment will affect EU ministers, state leaders and governments on December 9th.
SETimes: How would the arrest of Ratko Mladic is easily facilitating the European integration process?
Delovic: The political climate has changed, and a key official application has been met.
I think this is important for the arrest of Mladic, the arrest of European integration.
At the same time, the arrest revealed our commitment to international obligations and the rule of law, while we believe that any crimes will not be punished, regional consensus and stable targets of regional compromise and stability.
SETimes: The Netherlands has been one of the most serious defendants that Serbia has been suspended until the European integration process is arrested.
Despite the arrest of Mladic, Serbia and the EU have not yet approved a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
How do you have a message to the Netherlands?
Delovic: I expect the Netherlands to ratify this document.
I think that we have many things and the Dutch parliament will do so.
However, the only country facing the agreement is not the Netherlands, but many countries have yet to ratify the Agreement.
SETimes: Many think that Serbia will not be taken into EU membership in the next expansion, due to the serious crisis in the EU.
How do you respond to these suspects?
Delic: I think that the enlargement process is now on economic crisis and political conditions in member states, and this will affect the expansion of expansion, and I think that this crisis will be very serious, and I think that this crisis is a dangerous factor that the EU has risen its strategic interests, and I think that the Union is in accordance with its strategic interests of EU membership.

"A regional conference will not represent the recognition of the independence of Kosovo," Tadic told reporters after a meeting with Hungarian President Laszlo Schwarzm in Novi Sad on Sunday. "However, the decisions will be clear that Serbia will not recognise the independence of Kosovo with regional forum and participation."
He insisted that Kosovo should participate in international reforms, including most EU member states and the Balkan countries in the world, including Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Romania.
However, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said last week that he will participate as an independent state.
At the same time, "the European Union: The conference will be held under a European Charter" conference, Slovenia and Croatia.
The meeting also includes EU Council President Herman Rompuy as well as Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Moratinos, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Spain is one of the five members of the 27-nation bloc that have not recognised Kosovo.
Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor said last week that the region is aiming to promote EU membership targets and "a solution to some problems".
He added that the summit wants the Western Balkans to end a joint declaration on "with the European perspective".
Serbia, which submitted its official application for EU membership in December, has warned that the bloc has been cautioned on Kosovo, according to Euobserver.
"We will have a lot of questions that Serbia will be allowed to decide whether Kosovo can participate in international and regional reforms," a senior EU diplomat quoted Euobserver as saying. "In the past, we have been convinced, but it is now here to do so."
A week later, Cedomir Jovanovic, leader of the pro-European Liberal Democratic Party of Serbia, urged Tadic to meet with Kosovo leaders, as well as a good development.
"We need to be able to surrender for the war," Belgrade-based B92 quoted Jovanovic as saying.

The Public Authorities' Office (KGD) has caused thousands of people in Macedonia earlier this month, due to the "smaller" system of widespread wage ".
Among the reasons, the presidential race was two major places.
According to the daily, the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and the opposition Social Democrats, Georgi Ivanov and Ljubomir Frattini, who are candidates for the candidates of the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and opposition Social Democrats, did not pay their salaries by December and January.
Both are being a legal teacher at the University of Skopje.
In addition to the next day, Macedonians have no expenditures and labour payments, as well as their money.
According to local media estimates, about 600,000 citizens' average debt to the banks in November 2008, there are no arguments against the penalties.
In mid-February, the situation is still unknown, but the KGD said that more than 60,000 registered jobs in the country are still unable to pay the insurance and salaries of more than 460,000 people in the country.
The government believes that it would have to pay the workers' contributions to the public transparency and health insurance, to increase the new system, and said it would be forced to pay their contribution to the employees' contributions until 15 months, because they will face pensions on the COD 'workers' contributions.
Although the government did not submit the threat of threats, and the government sentenced to nearly 5,000 businesses that have not submitted their obligations until February 15th.
The charges were broadcast.
The finance ministry criticised the budget deficit of January.
The company has not confirmed its responsibility for the KGD programme.
Meanwhile, widespread managers claim that a study of the former KGD writer is completed by the bloc, even though a worker is not widespread information.
On February 11th, the success of parliament was showed as one of the reasons for the overall confidence vote, and the country wants to resign of Finance Minister Trajko Slavic.
Nevertheless, the government argues technology.
Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavreski described the system as "unsustainable and transparent", but argued that all European countries have "such".
He said the government will not be able to see problems.

The defence ministry announced on Sunday (May 29th) that Serbia-Montenegro will be able to hand over 90,000 army officers as part of its efforts to meet NATO standards this year.
With a total of 1,400 professional soldiers in Serbia, the number of professional soldiers and civilian soldiers in Montenegro will drop to 1,800 and 800.
The ministry said that the first phase will be able to pay for a group in the first phase, and the privatisation of some facilities will be used.
As part of the sovereignty army reform, 4,200 civilians and 1,300 officers were injured in Serbia at the beginning of April. The Serbia-Montenegro Army will be installed by 7,70,000 people.
According to Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic, the reduction of the number of military personnel is being signed by the IMF, which is expected to support reforms with the Serbian government.
Davinic said the Serbian Ministry of Finance won 6,500 people from the military budget in January.
"They are still willing to pay for the budget, and this is a lot," Davinic said.
Public unemployment rate will be very active in Serbia.
According to official data, about 800m euros in Serbia are not working.
The government and the army have no specific social programmes for discrimination, and this is not new jobs.
Following the unrest of the army, 4,500 euros will be spent between 4,000 and 500m euros.
Those who want their own system will be more than 20 per cent.
A spokesperson for civilian employees, Vladimir Stanirovic, says that the state is successful to protect the lawmakers, because it is no longer optimistic that people will be able to see them from the defence ministry.
Stanisic said he would apply to international institutions and courts with the court "dismissed decisions".
Nevertheless, only 270 military commissioners have been advised to the military commission and returned to their jobs.
This year, the army is expected to be reduced, as well as privatisation in major public companies -- and the results of the process will be made.
As a result, the government will take social pressure on the government.

EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon met with Belgrade officials on Wednesday (March 3rd) to discuss strengthening the rule of law in Kosovo.
De Kermabon met with Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic and State Secretary Slobodan Hoxha in Mitrovica on ways to improve the courts.
"Both sides agreed that talks on improving the situation of the rule of law in Kosovo are a highly positive, positive and constructive," EULEX quoted him as saying in a press release.
"Of course, the justice, justice, business and customs of all communities have been acceptable for all communities," he said.
EULEX confirmed that "a number of concrete measures" to achieve functional solutions "will be discussed, and" will be held in the field of justice, especially in the justice. "
"The rule of law in the north of Kosovo is a clear need for improving the situation of the rule of law, and the best way for progress is to find a stable solution," the EU mission said.
According to Bogdanovic, the EU mission is supporting the plan for the Serb majority to northern Kosovo.
The proposal, adopted by the International Civilian Office in Kosovo (ICO) and the Kosovo government, envisions the distribution of parallel structures supported by the northern part of the country.
"De Kermabon, EULEX and the EU will not support violence in northern Kosovo," Belgrade-based Radio B92 quoted Bogdanovic as saying after a meeting Wednesday.
De Kermabon told the Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti earlier this month that the ICO plan is not a EULEX strategy.
"We believe that progress in northern Kosovo can be achieved only through dialogue," De Kermabon said.
Bogdanovic said the talks focused on the establishment of a joint working group "on the establishment of a co-operation group of EULEX / EULEX / EULEX /" in the field of customs, justice and law ".
EULEX, however, denied on Wednesday that it is an agreement on working groups.
"There was no agreement on the establishment of working groups in the customs, justice and law," the mission said. "In the meetings, the courts have been closed to normalisation of the work of the courts in Mitrovica."
However, he told the Serbian media that "the need to co-operate on war crimes, the importance of the fight against organised crime is important and the talks on the documentation for almost two years".
"We have made it clear that we have prepared to enhance war crimes, but we need EULEX to help," Belgrade-based B92 quoted Hoxha as saying.
Ahead of talks with De Kermabon, Bogdanovic said that certain issues reflected to the Serbian media are not easy.
He cited "the current legislation in northern Kosovo, after the customs protocol, the implementation of the police protocol and exchange among two administrations."
EULEX has not confirmed any discussions on these issues.

Basescu &aposs decision to open the new president of the Intelligence Services has been sparked by the political scene.
Several people have been suggesting their differences, but Muror has been opposed to violence.
The move envisions the leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic Alliance.
Prime Minister Colin Popescu Tariceanu is viewed as the president of the Liberals' movement.
The party has met its forces with the ultranationalist Romanian Party, which opposes Muror.
Civilian organisations have been surprised.

The PSD, however, has been consisting of control of these services, but the political will needed for reform, "the PSD said.
Furthermore, the PSD has been divided with him.
The "Cluj opponent" has won the decision.

The claims that the new Macedonian government has been simply sovereignty of foreign aid.
The allegations by the government spokesman Veton Ibrahi last week were dismissed by former Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska, who is responsible for European Integration.
According to Ibrahi, some ambassadors have convicted that he was used by foreign aid under the administration.
He said a government commission on the issue will be formed and that the police, finance ministry and the fight against corruption commission will also be done.
Sekerinska responded, saying it is important to convince the investigative charges.
The former prime minister accused the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party of trying to intervene with the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, ahead of its confidence vote on former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski.
Sekerinska is seen as the most serious candidate after Buckovski, where he died on Saturday (October 7th).
Analysts say Sekerinska has the potential to increase the party, which is currently the worst period of history.
International officials and diplomats say the poor management claims are unfair.
US Ambassador to Macedonia Gillian Milovanovic, Britain Ambassador Robert Chrid and EU Special Representative Erwan Fouere are against Ibrahim.
"In the media, the previous US government said it was surprised that media reports accused the US government of using donors, including aid from USAID.
"The embassy said that there is no allegations of use of abuse."
"The USAID is in accordance with the US government that envisions all goods, fair, transparency and competitiveness.
Even before the approval of any project, practice partners and monetary policies and procedures are dismissed.
"We have shown that all financial resources and projects are being implemented by the Women and independent firms, and they are satisfied with the experience of developing procedures," Fouere said, adding that the procedures were satisfied with the procedures.
"We are satisfied with the responsibility of EU aid to full transparency, and we are satisfied with the results of the European Investment Agency," Fouere said.
Bener remarks came from the British ambassador.
"We continue to work together with the government in a comprehensive programme with the government, which is a problem that we use any national or funds," Dickson said.

The document will also be a clear political signal to EU and NATO officials, stressing that only people must return to the former communities, but also emphasised that the returns should be resolved in the region.
More than eight years after the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, governments in the conflict are still trying to encourage refugees.
However, there are problems: some however, there are some circumstances.
Following the delay, foreign governments are trying to speed up this process, encouraging refugee returns, encouraging refugee returns and training for the benefits of consensus.
However, the region began to weaken its own plans to return to the rest of its citizens.
Although Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro have expressed their readiness to join the Euro-Atlantic allies, the political police in Brussels has made clear that the return of refugees in Brussels should be completed.
So far, the results have been encouraged, but there is no concrete concrete.
Some refugees do not want to return to former municipalities for their new life.
Members who want to return, they need to see the opportunity to resume their lives and regain their goods.
Mesic, who has decided to co-operate with the leaders and decide to make clear messages to the return process, has been positive.
Since democracy, countries in the region have entered a closer co-operation.
However, new steps are needed for stability and reconciliation.
Mesic, who believes the time has been closely closed to the chapters such as the refugee problem, has asked the international support.
After the results of the talks, the three sides will be signed at a high-level meeting.
According to Mesic, the agreement should be taken into concrete measures that will be based on joint principles and values, and after concrete results.

Balkan countries are trying to seek weapons and ammunition
The Balkans continues to be a weapons of weapons, despite efforts to disarm people.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 05 / 09 / 11
"If the weapons is high, the public will be good for security funds," said Albanian interior ministry official Cavea. [Reuters]
Regional statistics in the region are extremely surprised, and the results could be death.
In Albania, for example, analyst Jones Kola was shown that 95% of the population are weapons in the house this summer. On July 18th, there are cases such as the murder of a 11-year-old children in Shkodra.
"In 1997, there is an increase of weapons of weapons to civilians," Albanian Interior Ministry official Cava Sala told SETimes.
The South Eastern Europe and Eastern Europe Centre (SEEA) is the priority for efforts to boost national and regional capacity to protect small and weapons' use of weapons and smaller weapons.
"The idea is still a key task that the governments of the region are not fully expensive," Iva Proic, director of the SEESC Bureau project in Belgrade, told SETimes.
He acknowledged that the SEESAC has no security and compliance with the number of illegal weapons in various countries.
But in the Western Balkans, "the 19.6 million people have a population of 19.6 million people," a survey conducted by SEEC in 2007 said in a study by civilians.
In Kosovo, the Kosovo daily Koha Ditore has been released by a UNDP survey.
The survey found that 400,000 weapons in citizens are illegal.
"The free movement of weapons is not only a permanent dangerous threat to the safety of children," Mima Sahin, a leading psychologist in Kosovo, told SETimes.
"Among the young people," it is increasingly increasing the level of crime, "he said.
The witnesses, he added, are "above the tragedy".
The regional governments in the region have a clear decision to stop illegal weapons, he says.
He said the Croatian interior ministry has launched a "more Armed weapons, more known as" Agim Trajy "and a campaign of weapons.
Such programmes will help change "the current weapons in the region, he says, encouraging illegal weapons to send volunteers" and that it will be able to make them in the future ".
He added that the Croatian government has achieved an estimated 58,000 smaller weapons and explosives from civilians since 2007, nearly two million ammunition and about 2m tonnes of explosion.
He hopes a similar campaign will start in Serbia in the months.
In addition, both Serbia and Croatia, the Swiss Armed Forces and the Conservative Armed Forces (SALLW) are simply opposed.
Among SEESAC and EU aid, the interior ministry of Serbia increased 285,000 euros in 2010 and more than 27,000 needs in 2009.
The Croatian interior ministry launched its campaign this year.
"So far, there are more than 30,000 weapons of weapons," he said.
In order to avoid the continuation of the army, some governments in the region have taken measures to ensure their own police stations.
SEESAC is currently helping the governments of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to boost security in the SALW police stations.
In May, for example, Montenegro was completed with the reconstruction of the "Ozas" ammunition police station.
Another option should be taken, he said, "The conflict will help the current laws in illegal weapons to stop illegal weapons in the region, to help the efforts of illegal weapons under illegal weapons."

"We hope that such a reconciliation will be reached within a stage," the commissioner added.
Former Israeli ambassador to Turkey Alon Liel said the main topic in Israel relations in the past six months is "free or unfair".
"Israel has decided to be resolved more than a year ago, and now Turkey has to participate in the second round of diplomatic relations, which is the lowest diplomatic level in the Israeli diplomat of Israel," he said.
"We can [have] damaged Israel] bilateral relations," he added.
"No dangerous level of this incidents is not a dangerous level."
"We have no problems between our countries.
So far, Israel is the worst for Turkey.

Iran agreed on Monday (May 17th) to send a large number of smaller tensions in a deal signed with Brezak and Turkey on Monday (May 17th).
However, the move was criticised by the EU and Russian officials, as Iran would convince the UN Security Council decisions, saying it would replace 20% tensions programme.
According to a deal signed by the three countries' foreign ministers, Iran 'lowest tensions will be sent to Turkey within a month.
At the same time, a different foreign sources will be used to use the medical research sector for more than a year later.
Takas took place after Iranian President Mehmet Ahmejad, Brezech counterpart Lula Lula and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan held talks on the controversial nuclear programme.
On Monday, the deal is based on a deal that was signed by the International Authority (IAA) mediator last year and will send about 80% of Iran 'smaller revenues to transform the nuclear transportation.
Tehran accepted the agreement in October, but cautioned that he could face new sanctions by the UN.
Iran is believed to have increased from 1,500kg today to about 230,000.
David Colonel, a professor of Science and International Security in Washington, said the country is two of the amount of amounts to supervised suicide for a bombing.
A move by Tehran to 3.5% of the target of tensions for four months ago has caused greater concern among Western forces, which are worried about the real targets of Iran.
"For us, there is no other need for new sanctions or measures," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters in Tehran. "We hope that Iran will send a letter to IAEA and we hope that the IAEA will give a letter to a letter to a letter to the end of consequences in Vienna."
However, Western officials have made clear that the new agreement is not going to work on new UN sanctions against Iran, saying the new agreement does not go to Iran.
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, spokesperson for EU foreign policy Catherine Ashton, said on Monday that the agreement seems to be a "new" deal, which was signed by the IAEA last year.
"If Iran accepts the IAEA proposal, this is a good news, it cannot solve the basic challenge that the international community is facing serious concerns about the peace programme," the DPA quoted Kocic as saying.
"The reason for the Security Council is still continuing to continue its decision, the reason that Iran does not have a serious effect and should not take decisions on the protocol," he said.
Both members of the Black Sea Security Council have been taking part in efforts to Turkey and Brezak, but the agreement should now be transferred to the IAA "clear and constructive" IEA ".
"The United States and the international community are continuing serious concerns, as Iran has not repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly said.

The party did not win a smaller majority in the October 23rd elections, and now has to find a common position to form a coalition government.
The cabinet will also serve during talks on the final status of Kosovo, expected to begin in mid-2005.
The results released by the Central Election Commission (CEC) on Wednesday (November 3rd) showed that the LDK won 45.2 per cent of the votes, and that the province would protect the right to represent 47 seats in the 120 seats for Kosovo minority representatives.

The Alliance for the Future of Kosovo, Ramush Haradinaj, won 8.4 per cent of the vote and won 9 seats.
The new ORA, founded by journalist and journalist Veton Syria, won 6.23 per cent and four seats in parliament.
A total of six Kosovo Albanian parties, including six Kosovo Albanian parties, were discovered by various ethnic groups.
The OSCE said on Wednesday that the two units were made in line with the competition for 20 seats that have been replaced by Kosovo minorities.
Kosovo Serb representatives will be granted the Serbian List for Kosovo and Metohija for ten seats, and two will be given to the Serbian Highth Initiative.
The 10-seat seats will include Bosniak, Turkish, Roma, Egypt, Egyptian and GDP communities.
According to the results, accession was 53.7 per cent.
About 660 votes voted for a total of 1.3 million voters.
However, the Kosovo Serb community has been under 1 per cent of accession.
The majority of voters in accordance with the world rejected Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, other Belgrade officials and the Serbian Orthodox Church for a boycott.
The international community said the province is planning to launch talks on the final status of Kosovo, if the province has made progress in meeting the criteria for the rule of law, minority rights and dialogue with Pristina in mid-2005.
The head of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo and CEC Vice-President Jorge Modrag called on Wednesday to "build a new government and" continue to continue progress in implementing the standards of international community, as well as the international community ".
Some have voiced concern about a possible stalemate in the talks on the government, and that the parties were repeatedly repeatedly supported by a situation in 2001.
The remarks say Rugova will be a partner between the pro-independent Kosovo Albanian parties and the talks will lead to a number of major changes in the current government.
Speaking to Reuters, a Western diplomat acknowledged the possibility of a certain delay, but said it would be soon as possible.
"They are not only a few weeks.
However, many weeks are not, "he said.
Local journalists predict that UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen could intervene if the agreement was reached on 10 days.

Macedonian citizens will decide on Sunday (November 7th) in a referendum between the former 1996 law on a new territory.
The new law, which will reunify the current 123 municipalities, aims to implement one of the obligations the country is under the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
According to international officials, the referendum will have effective effects on Macedonia &aposs final bid to join NATO and the EU.
"The local government is one of the truth of the Ohrid Agreement and is a basic factor that would allow the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to participate in Euro-Atlantic structures," NATO Secretary-General Alphanto Rizzo said last week.
In a statement Monday, the EU said Macedonia has respected the right to hold a referendum on the constitution, but warned that a delay in the local government would "be dangerous to progress towards the EU".
Among other parties, the main opposition VMRO-DPMNE, argues that the law would lead to divisions, division of the country, federation and ethnic groups.
"It is clear that the state will become a state," VMRO-DPMNE leader Nikola Gruevski said. "It is a historic responsibility for protecting the state."
Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska, who is responsible for European participation in the country, said that it would lead Macedonia to a institutional and political crisis, which would lead to delay in meeting EU political criteria.
According to Sekerinska, Macedonia will remain at least a year in implementing local governments or responsibility for municipalities.
According to the constitution, the results of a referendum have been changed for a year.
The law requires at least 85,000 voters to be successful.
The ruling coalition has called for the public to stay in their homes, as the voting is unacceptable for the participation of the vote.

The Serbian Public Administration submitted a proposal to increase the risk of risk for everyone who are facing commercial or other corruption.
The measure will be identified as a "cheaper" -- one of the most convicted of corruption.
"The state is ready to fight corruption, and I claim that it will be able to see such factors that are facing corruption," Executive Director Dragan Radosavljevic told the state television RTS.
The proposal is calling for the removal of the unit as a removal of the units.
While acknowledging the fight against corruption, the public argues that a number of lawmakers and NGOs are disappointed with the constitution.
They say that if the current laws are implemented, corruption will be more successful.
"This is a constitution. It is not possible to accept a single person of the government," Zlatko Minic, a member of the Anti-Corruption Agency, told SETimes.
"The Constitutional Court will likely be defined by the Constitutional Court," he added.
They claim the fight against corruption is more efficient.
"Authorities should encourage people who announced more corruption and protect them, as well as protecting them in public service, as well as to protect the peacekepers and to prove that the salaries are not able to make such a tender," International Transparency Serbia representative Nemanja Nenic told SETimes.
However, Radosavljevic argues that more measures are needed.
"It is a negative impact on all institutional institutions, the industry and the government, and the image of the state," he said.
Experts say that the Public Progress' recommendation is defined.
"This measure is being implemented against organised crime and war crimes governments in Serbia, and they do not have to prove that they need to prove the money that must be able to prevent them to ensure their assets," he said.
However, he said, the Public Protection Agency has a chance to check the assets of people.
"The law on the implementation of the tax administration and tax revenue in 2002 is allowing the law to boost revenues and expenditures, and will not be able to use this mechanism before it proposed," he said.
In addition, personnel who have a clear corruption suspect have been injured, but there is no evidence, "he said.
Corruption is considered a key precondition for EU membership.
Serbian citizens have increased corruption over the past three years, according to a Government of the Government for Corruption Barota last year.
At the same time, the government has declined to 2.2 to 2.8, while the cabinet announced plans to prepare a new strategy.

A visit by former US President Bill Clinton to prepare a visit to the protocol, police, corruption and smuggling, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) officials have not agreed on the award for the award at the Sarajevo Film Festival this year, allowing the festival to take the award, nine, nine.
"I expect the movies to see a unique response," said Air Kenovic, the director of three more traffic films in BiH last year.
"It is clear that these achievements are not removed.
The youth who featured the movie will have more cheaper to work long traffic, "he said.
Gorori (First), the first traffic movie of director Pjer Zalica, won five awards, including two best regional film.
The festival organisers' organisers' movies in the National Sinema Congress, which took part in the six countries' regional programme this year, sparked disappointments at the local architecture.
With BiH structures as soon as protocol, regional movies will benefit from local benefits.

As part of the BiH programme, Srdjan Vujanovic was held at the festival, as part of the film, was held in the BiH programme, and the Golden Golden Women (Golden) movie was held in the world.
Among the three films in a year, the movie does not mean a good atmosphere for a three films from 1992 to 2001.
However, BiH director Denis Tanovic has said he did not know whether local movies have been injured by the Ottoman Regional Regional Award in 2002.
The government has established a film for financing the movies of Zalica and Vujanovic.
It is a joint problem of all regional directors.
Bulgarian director Luxembourg Todorov said his country is now on two years or three films, but this figure is about 20 years in the Communist regime.
"This is no foreign currency," Todorov said, "because of the regional film, financed by the National Film Centre and state television.
"It is easy, but it is slow," he added.
As part of the regional programme, the festival was the highest level of accession.
The Paster is a hundreds of people who were sold on the websites, while the festival has set up a week before the festival.
In all, 162 films from 44 countries were injured.
Following the award at the film festival in Switzerland last week, media, such as Gorori, who met with the award at the film festival in Switzerland.
"We do not want to get the film.
However, there is no film.
This will be good, if the movie is able to increase the interest of the money in the rest of the money, "he said.

The Turkish Islamist government won a victory this week in the ruling coalition, which has reached a climate between the armed forces.
Following a four-day meeting of the High Representative Chief of Defence, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sparked two sides of the armed forces' reactions against the government.
In Turkey, the military has been completed in the past 50 years, and the army is completely independent, and the army was approved only by politicians.
However, this year, Erdogan refused to ratify General Hasan Ilic, who elected the army 'commander of the army, but refused to adopt a call on the government to tackle the investigation into a special diplomat.
According to some observers, the government won a victory in civil democracy during the summit last week.
However, criticism from the ruling Justice and Development Party say the government has been implemented in a five-hicle measures to overcome the Islamic dictator.
"There are two minutes of Maddad '," Jusuf Canada, a political commentator in the List opposition stations, told SETimes. "It is not a major step in the first time because of a civilian government is not the responsibility of this responsibility and I will decide on the democracy of Turkish democracy."
"However, they are working to strengthen their goals.
The government does not do so to contribute to the Turkish democracy, but it is trying to stop people who want to ask it. "
The statement is among 18 high-ranking officers who called on the internet programme to convince the committee.
Lieutenant General Ilker Koher was prepared to fulfil his post by General Staff General Staff on 30 August.
However, the stalemate was stalled, due to the delay over Ireland.
Among the list of terrorists, 11 other officers have been indicted for the arrest of an Islamist government in 2003 for the arrest of a diplomat.
The bailout plan was discovered in February and allegedly linked to the Armenian newspaper to create a couple of military climate in the country to create a couple of military couple, and Greece has also been charged with military tensions.
Last month, the army was arrested for 102 officers on the plan, claiming that the army is part of a military training system aimed at boosting the situation.
"All these issues are also involved in these issues, but the government is used to send the issue.
We need to discourage military operations in this country.
However, NGOs are more dangerous, "he said.
"This is a step towards democracy, but the problem is that some parts of the government are considered the final protection of the interests of the society as a traditional protection," said Mustafa Mediterranean, a commentator of the Star daily Star.
"It is time to have political structures without the army.
Turkey is not an operator.
Opposition media and opposition parties.
The military should not be a role. "

Turkish Army Commander: The country 'Reconstruction of Iraq
The chief of the Turkish military, he cautioned that Ankara 'decision to send troops to Iraq was sentenced to the right of Turkey to reunify its neighbours' political restructuring.
(The New York Times - 10 / 11 / 03; Reuters, AFP - 09 / 11 / 03; BBC, Reuters, FT, VOA, Anatolian Agency - 07 / 11 / 03)
The chief of the Turkish Army of Staff has warned Ankara 'decision to send troops to Iraq was sentenced to the country' right to make the future political structure.
"We do not know that Iraq will be the last time.
The general remarks came after the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced on Friday that Ankara has decided to send troops to Iraq so far.
The decision was made during a telephone meeting between Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and US Secretary of State Colin Powell on Thursday.
The Turkish government has been approved by parliament in early October, when the US peacekeeping force in Iraq was approved by parliament, but the Iraq government and the Iraqi Kurds have been met with consultations.
Turkish public opinion has been opposed to military plans.
"It was very clear that we have not been willing to send troops since the beginning," the BBC quoted Gul as saying on Friday. "We have said that we will send [troops] if we are able to benefit.
However, there is no situation.
This decision is the reason for us. "
Foreign Minister Richard Boucher, who reiterated Washington for amendments to the plan on Friday, said the phenomenon is the need for the stability of Iraq.
"The investment, both the United States and the Iraqi sides, will not serve as an attempt to serve as a goal that we will send troops to us," Boucher said in a speech.
"We are still very satisfied with our conditions," Gul said in Ankara.
Ozgur repeatedly repeatedly said his country will be closed to developments, as it will affect a stable stability in Iraq.
Turkey has voiced concern that the Kurds in northern Iraq are seeking to fight independence, adding that the potential would revive ethnic Kurds in the southern part of Turkey.
"Terrorism operations have been stopped.
The situation of Iraq will become a terrorist organisation.
If Iraq has been divided and the north, this will affect us as much. "
At the same time, he repeatedly removed the need for the rest of 1,500 Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq.
"Our forces in the armed forces have shown our determination, and this is a sign that the region is affected by us," he said. "We will continue to continue if we will change this, we will continue to change this," he said.

Citing the EC decision Tuesday, commissioner Krizina Nagy called on Bulgaria to move a step forward to improve its management of EU funds.
According to the EC, Bulgaria has not improved reforms that have been initiated this year, it has not been able to improve its administration.
"I know that the action plan is prepared and I know that the current measures have been removed, but they are not able to concrete concrete concrete results," Rehn said.
On Tuesday, Bulgarian officials were prepared.
Among both Berlin, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and the deputy director of the EU funds, Meglena Plugeva, voiced criticism of the EC "disappointments".

The EU Council of Ministers launched a new mechanism for Croatia to close accession negotiations and open its accession talks by the end of the year, after Croatia decided to open its accession talks.
The commission aims to assess Croatia 'preparations for full membership, saying it continues to continue with serious problems against organised crime and corruption, but aims to promote the situation in Bulgaria and Romania, which is due to join the EU in 2007.
"The reform efforts, as soon as possible, will allow Croatia and the current member states to ensure the necessary security of reforms," the EU leaders said in a report on Croatia on 24 June.
Croatia will be the first EU candidate country to be implemented by the Council of Ministerial system, which will continue until July 1st 2014.
"Although Croatia has made significant progress, the court must continue to work on the implementation of the proceedings and the legal system of all citizens," EC Vice President and Justice Affairs Vienna Redzak told Deutsche Welle, in an interview with Deutsche Welle.
The comments on the Justice and Team Human Rights, including the continuation of judicial reform and efficiency of war crimes cases, will be published in a six-month Council report on the progress of a six months.
The commission will meet Croatian authorities if the requirements are needed.
This mechanism will allow the EU to implement "stable pressure" during the period of accession talks with the accession talks.
Several EU governments, including France, Britain, Britain and the Netherlands, argue that Croatia is in the process.
The EU is open to a good teacher from Romania and Bulgaria before its participation.
David Florli, a professor at the University of Southeast European Studies, says there is another reason for the new monitoring mechanism.
"The negotiations of Croatia have been made very difficult, so that the communities should meet some of them, especially in the fight against corruption and the rule of law," he told SETimes.
Croatian state officials are encouraging optimism and new mechanisms to continue reforms.
"The implementation of the implementation and the general scandal of Croatia in the closure chapters have confirmed that the country is not a member of an EU member for full membership and security capacity," a spokesperson for the Croatian Foreign and European Integration Ministry told SETimes. "A strong commitment to the future status of this year will be strong."
"This new mechanism is a good job," he said, noting that the EU has the new and constructive ways to complete its accession negotiations and make progress. "
The new mechanism in Croatia is an example of negotiations with other countries in the Balkans, as a broad EU enlargement perspective.

Turkey rejects genocide claims, while the problem is protecting the problem.
(Zaman, The Gulf Today, Zaman - 25 / 04 / 11; White House, Hurriyet, World Bank, RFE / RL, VOA, The Washington Times, Deutsche Welle - 24 / 04 / 11)
"Sayaj Obama [is] a unilateral and historic perspective," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Sunday (24 April). [Reuters]
US President Barack Obama, speaking at the weekend Armenian Academy, described the death of 91.5 million Armenians as "one of the biggest weapons in the 20th century", but not the use of genocide.
"I expressed regret about the incidents in 1915 and did not change the issue.
"It is clear that all those who have been acceptable and fair acceptance are acceptable," he said.
In a response to Obama, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the statement was "a statement that is" the only and a single historic perspective ".
"This issue has been held every year, and our relations with the United States have been reduced," the Istanbul daily Hurriyet reported.
"We expect Obama to see that they live in the period," he said.
The incidents described the first genocide in the 20th century as the first year of genocide. In 1915-16, 1.5 million Armenians were participated.
However, Ankara has rejected claims, however, that the figures are increasing and the death of a broad civilian war, and that Turks are dead in the same process.
Today, the social debate in Turkey has been unable to controversial discussions on this issue.
However, this has now started to change.
The smaller ceremony in the country on Sunday (April 24th) took place by Ottoman officials in Istanbul, where he was arrested by Ottoman officials.
Most of the detainees were restored to the Middle East and thought to live.
Although Turkey has insisted that the Armenians have no plan for the system for years, it was the beginning of a major mechanism for the movement, according to many others.
On Saturday, Obama praised Ankara and Erivan for their efforts to improve bilateral relations in the past decades, urging the two countries to continue on this road.
"I think that Armenians rescued in the 1915," Obama said, "I think that the dialogue between Turks and Armenians have been realised in this way.
Turkish and Armenians will strengthen their joint history, joint history and common people, "he said.
Following the traffic incidents in Turkey, Armenians from the world have contributed to the world, Obama voiced "a sign of the Armenians" of their contributions, widespread and tolerance ".
The US Armenian law in the United States did not say that the president was appointed and accused Ergenekon for failing to fulfil that he would recognise Armenian genocide before the elections.
"More than 1.5 million men, women and children were not allowed to send a number of female players and boys, and not to ask the Turkish government to assembly in parliament, because this is not a clear and a clear controversial controversial debate," the US Armenian Parliament said in a statement.

The Turkish humanitarian group, which organised the controversial Gazprom last year, plans to make a similar action next month.
Government officials confirmed on 14 April that Israel wants Ankara to block this new mission.
The government, however, insists that there is no obstacle to the road.
The previous aid mission repeatedly called Israel to live in the life of eight Turkish and a Turkish nationalism.
The IHR congratulated Israel 'bid to Gaza, which has been acting in accordance with international law.
Analysts say Turkey has criticised Israel 'policy for Palestinians, but criticised the Justice and Development Party (AKP) with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"In Turkey, the public in the Palestinian people have always been concerned with the Palestinian people, but they do not see the public as much as foreign policy.
Now it is different.
"The AKP is very successful," he said.
Turkey seems to play a car role among different groups in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years.
Earlier this month, the country proposed to host a meeting between Feth and Hamas, the two opponents in Palestinian.
"Turkey is a special mission between the Middle East and Europe in the end of the past, and it sees itself a special partner for other countries in the region," he told SETimes.
However, Turkey met with Hamas, with Hamas, the Palestinian management of Palestinian.
"The official Palestinian government is crucial.
This is the political climate, and it is not a constructive approach to weakness the country ’ s official power. "
Following the death crisis in Turkey last year, Israel won no option.
A popular movie by the Prosecutors' Women 'Foundation, which was shown in January, was not surprised by Israels.
While the army sent to Turkey to Israel in December, at least 44 people were sent to the death of Karamir in December, it was one of the two countries' co-operation.
Despite several questions that must be resolved, some experts hope.
"The Turkish entity should not be in accordance with the interests of Turkey, and that Israel should regain the security of Israel.
It is difficult to see that Israel is more efficient, and the Israeli government continues to reduce its politics, and the Israeli government continues to restore Gaza. "
"Our goal is to block the measures that can be able to stay in a way, and how we can reflect the real strategic partners and reflect our policy in the region," he said.
In Turkey, Israel has many friends in Israel.
And both sides will be able to find a solution. "

The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is seeking to provide a two-thirds majority for the presidential candidate, ahead of the first round of parliamentary vote on Friday (April 27th).

Although the AKP rejected it, the parties are insisting that the party has a secret agenda.
Gul, who wants to district these weapons, has been elected on Tuesday, promised that the principal principles will not be elected and that all public will be the president.
"I think that the republic is a democratic and social state that is the constitution, the rule of law," Gul said in an interview with the daily Milliyet on Thursday.
Critics argue that Gul will help the AKP to remove the current wealth of the current weapons, following a major ceremony in the presidency.
The law envisions Turkish women from universities and state agencies.
The wife of Erdogan and Argentina, such as Erdogan and Armenia, is also on the island of Hyria.
Gul said this week that his statement should be personal and respected.

He said he would not be more broad than the ten defendants, but that the case will be made during the hearing.
According to the court, two soldiers from the Serbian and Montenegrin Army, Dragan Jakovljevic and Drazen Milovanovic, at a military operation in Karas in 2004, he had the opportunity to reveal a good information that Mladic was hiding.
Prosecutors said the trial is not convinced that the case will not be fair and unfair.
"It is still clear that the case can be able to assist Mladic from really really really, and that the case is still unfair if the state intervened," Jusuto Bott told SETimes.
Mladic will face the court on 22 February.
The first trial against him was more than four years after 2010.

The controversial debate between Greece and Macedonia took place at the end of December.
This time, a new name in the Skopje airport -- Aleksandar Macedonia (Macedonian) -- has announced a statement that it would be granted.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis, who accused Skopje of defining the date, repeatedly reiterated Macedonian Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis' threat to the EU integration process two months ago.
"A long time after 2,000 years can be changed," Bakoyannis said. "This true accordance is created and the obligations of good neighbourly relations and their obligations to the EU.
They do not serve for Euro-Atlantic goals.
Greece has made it clear that it has made it clear.
This is a stance supported by all political organisations. "
The ancient cultural heritage of the ancient Macedonian cultural heritage has been on the issue since the country declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992.
Among the disputes, "Macedonia" was discovered in Greece, but a controversial controversy of the Macedonian minority in Vergina and a "Macedonian minority" in northern Greece.
In the north of Greece, the region of Macedonia has shown the allegations that the cultural heritage was destroyed, and the Macedonian government faces protests against policies in the beginning of the 1990s.
The prime minister, who has his own airport "in Macedonia", has been widely critical of criticism for the change of the Skopje airport.
"We want to co-operate with good neighbourly relations, but we do not want to see the history," he said.
He said these movements are friendly, and that the move would not be able to resolve problems in the country.
Nevertheless, Athens has responded to the Macedonian government last month to respond to the "concerns about the Macedonian minority" in northern Greece, which has rejected the presence of Bakoyannis.
Special Representative Matthew Nimetz proposed some solutions to the former Yugoslav republics' name dispute, known as the FYYM in the UN, but also rejected both sides.
However, the EU and NATO prospects for Macedonia, while both sides could have to pressure on the political scene to ensure a compromise that could be acceptable to a compromise.

"There is a opinion that Ahtisaari will submit the proposal for Kosovo after the elections in Serbia," he said.

"The majority of the political leaders in BiH is not a clear vision that they are trying to build a country," Hays said. "It is easy that a strategy to build a visa-free travel is easy, but we have been able to do so so far as a result of the current plan to build a visa-free and strategic strategy."
He noted that BiH politicians are unwilling to continue reforms with protecting their popularity in the past.
"These successful reforms in other transition countries have been removed from the tasks of criticism who have started to give a positive results," he said.
However, Hays added, however, that he has been characterised with the actions of implementing critical reforms.
If the change is better, it must continue to continue its reform agenda without the political changes to the political disputes, he added.
"We need a political classic, which is a precondition, and we need a confidence of the police," he said.
"I believe this is a change in BiH politicians' decision," he said. "We believe that the Dayton Accord is moved by Brussels and after the end of Brussels, there is a lot of transition problems that have been taken by the end of the war, but we believe that there is a lot of transition problems -- the European problem and the idea of democracy.
"We can see the outcome of the elections in the coming elections."
"European stability, visa liberalisation, a very real precedent, and the best aspirations for the future," Hays said. "European stability, visa liberalisation, visa liberalisation, very important, and that the goal is to ensure that people are necessary."

The Macedonian Parliament announced on November 7th as a historic date for the complex on new territorial law.
The decision came after the World Congress supported the initiative of the Macedonian Congress, which is part of the complex request.
Observers met on February 23rd and 23 August as a legal amount of six months.
Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski, who opposes the parliamentary session on the issue, said that lawmakers in the constitution should not think it will be a historic date.
The laws approved by the end of the month are fulfilling the remaining commitments under the Ohrid Peace Accords, which ended in 2001.
The opposition VMRO-DPMNE party and the Liberal Democrats said the historic initiative should be a historic date, which began.
"The World Congress wants the Macedonian Congress to be held on November 21st, so that Muslims should not accept this date," the VMRO-DPMNE said in a statement.
According to Rafis Aliti, a member of the small coalition member of the Democratic Union of Integration, however, the best voter is to be held.
"As a party, the 7 November proposal should be implemented for us," Aliti said.
"Do you accept the local administration (municipalities) and Skopje, which was recognised by the Republic of Macedonia in 1996 and the Local Intelligence Forces and the Local Privatisation Committee (Skopje), which was dismissed in the same year?" How will Macedonian voters respond to the question.
The law envisions public votes, but more than 50 per cent of voters are on the agenda.
The results are convinced and the state authorities must be implemented.
The local elections in Macedonia are now set by 21 November, but the complex is now under way.
In a vote of amendments to the local election law, the local elections decided to be held in the first four weeks of March.
However, the 2005 local elections will be held on March 31st.
Meanwhile, the EU has warned Macedonia that it could be dangerous if voters refuse to adopt laws on territory.
Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Tuesday (September 14th) that the Union is "essential" for full implementation of the Ohrid Agreement.
The EU also confirmed that the European Commission will be given to Skopje on 1 October for its application for candidate status.
Elections approve, controversial debate on Kurdish problem

The conflict between security forces and PKK terrorists is increasing, including a attack on Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’ s election congress.

Turkey has been a political crisis in the Middle East, while it has been seen as an example of co-operation between the Islamic and democracy.
With the general elections on 12 June, tensions between the state and the Kurdish community have reached a broadcaster level with Kurdish candidates, the arrest of students and threats from both sides.
The violence is increasing. On May 4th, PKK terrorists attacked a attack against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Despite the attack on the attack, Erdogan died a member of the police unit.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Election Council decision to adopt 12 independent candidates supported by the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), caused protests in southeastern and other areas.
During the demonstrations, a Kurdish civilian life was killed.
"The rise in the violence could be seen as a result of the ruling fight," Hidoglu, an expert on the Kurdish nationalism, told SETimes.
The public has been a member of the public, as well as the majority of the candidates that have repeatedly resigned in June, allowing the majority of the candidates to be nominated.
This decision reflects the eastern part of the Turkish politics and judicial system, which is the first time in the first phase of this decision.
Henry Barack, a member of the League of University of League and the International Public Information Organisation, described the law as "a recent initiative to promote the government and the army" of the state "to the polls.
Because of this decision, he said, the board "has nothing that people will not be able to see the BDP".
According to the professor, this is a positive signal for the difference of judges.
The National Strategic Studies Institute for Strategic Studies, Denmara Natasa, stressed the importance of protests.
"These incidents have shown that" high "response to these events is really really really," he said.
Such incidents are a precedent that the AKP has launched two years ago and controversial debate on the Kurdish community is a "transformation of a" Kurdish Assistance ", which will provide unprecedented rights for this population.
In this direction, the use of the Kurdistan Workers in 90 years is still a key point in the country, as well as the establishment of a state-run television station, which is still a law on the use of Kurdistan Workers.
However, the basic amendments that many people have not been done, and relations were discovered after the incidents, which were seen as a disease.
The protests and civil society campaign in the southern part of the Kurdish population is under way. [Reuters]
The party warns the differences in state structures and society, and warning that the current incidents have been seen as a result of improving relations.
"Such reactions do not represent a joint position of Turkish Cypriots.
In response to the Kurdish problem of the state, the political groups in different parts of the market have always been completely completely with different approval of the civilian and military elections, "he said.
The latest arrests and laws are the continuation of a long historic process.
"The arrests of the PKK and the Kurdish Independent for Independent (PKK) and the Kurdish Initiative (PKK) have been arrested in the past two months, and more than 2,000 people were arrested in the past two years," said Alia Marsin, a student of the book 'Association for Independent Independent and Belgium.
The election of next month is expected to be made by the AKP, which is currently in power.
The remaining seats are likely to be closed with the Constitutional Party (CHP) and the Movement for Democratic Action (MHP) and independent.
For the BDP, the party must become independent as an independent, because the 10% electoral message is needed to enter the parliament.
If these candidates will win 20 seats or more, a bloc can affect the parliamentary agenda, he said.
As a result of a series of political parties supported by the Kurds, the BDP has been completely unprecedented success last year, such a consequence is possible.
The best status of the party, according to Barack, has been pushing for a "unique boycott" in a referendum on constitutional changes last year.
Following the AKP elections, the 1980s military coupled and promised to make broad reforms in the constitution, which is not a large level of interest.
"The Kurds are expected to do a serious and major structure," he said. "The problem is that the constitution is a point that the Kurdish issue is a key step towards achieving a significant progress in the Kurdish rights and Kurdish relations."
The opportunity to strengthen the constitutional reform and strengthen minority rights is very important by the BDP and the Kurdish population.
The Kurds "no peacekeepers" are not a peaceful protest. [Reuters]
Natasa stressed that nationalist demands are part of the Kurdish plan.
According to him, there could be no value in the constitutional reform, "the evidence in the region", as well as a more attractive citizens that can encourage more positive relations between the Kurds and the state in Turkey. "
Meanwhile, all sides continue to meet bilateral threats and charges.
Earlier in the past two weeks, the BDP member of the Kurdish nationalist Movement announced that the Kurds would "build their own democracy" if the state does not ensure the state.
Erdogan refused to "the Kurdish problem", but State Secretary of State Armenic has made it clear that the AKP is recognising the problem.
Meanwhile, PKK Chairman Abdullah Ocalan cautioned that a deal between the government and Kurdistan Kurds could face broad violence after June 15th.
Despite the potential for a positive change after the weekend elections, the potential for a long-term solution is not expected and that there is a lot of time.
"They cannot change," Natasa said, adding that the real change and compromise will be "time", and they can take steps. "
"I think that the workers will be able to join," he told SETimes.

Most analysts in Belgrade believe Sunday (January 20th) that the Serbian presidential elections will decide on the future of the country and European integration.
Although the ninth political president is nominated, the Democratic Party of Serbia leader Boris Tadic and vice-president of the Serbian Radical Party, Tomislav Nikolic.
Tadic, who took office in 2004, argues that Serbia would speed up EU integration.
Nikolic argues that Russia is on the ground, and Moscow should not be tried to build military bases in Serbia.
Nikolic also said he would nominate Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, who has been indicted for war crimes at The Hague.
Tadic and Nikolic agree that Serbia does not recognise the independence of Kosovo.
The province, the majority of the population, is under UN administration since 1999.
Kosovo Albanians announced that they will declare independence within a few weeks.
A third political -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica -- could be repeated.
The polls show Tadic 'Nikolic' only partners, especially with the support of the Democratic Party of Serbia.
Kostunica, however, opposes the plan to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the UN mission in Kosovo, even though Tadic is scheduled for the EU plan.
He insists that the EU will not support Kosovo 'independence and will not sign the SAA with Serbia.
Now, Kostunica has chosen to support Velimir Ilic, the coalition partner in the previous parliamentary elections and is expected to vote by 8%.
Liberal Democratic Party leader Cedomir Jovanovic, the only candidate for Kosovo independence.
Jovanovic, such as Ilic, is expected to win about 8% of the vote Sunday.
The other five candidates are expected to vote.
According to the law, none of the candidates' candidates in the first round should be able to win a second round of votes, but the first two candidates must be able to win a second round of voting.
This is the most candidates for the vote.
According to survey polls by the Belgrade Special Elections and Democracy Centre, more than half will be done.
Nikolic is expected to win about 1.15 million votes in the first round, while Tadic is expected to provide an overhaul to Tadic, which is expected to win 1.05 million votes.
The ratification rate will play an important role in the results.
The smaller turnout could be allowed by voters' Radicals, who are very disciplinary.
However, Strategic Marketing Director Srdjan Bogavljevic said that the remaining seven candidates "are very weak for Nikolic" for the first round of voting ".
Bogavljevic said Serbia is facing a "very serious turmoil", but it is facing a very serious turn. "

Bosnia and Herzegovina has been acceptable to the European Civilian Air Conference last week, and only one of the conditions for the civil airport in the country to take over local officials.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 20 / 01 / 03
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) recently joined the European Civilian Azerbaijan and Yugoslavia (ECAC).
"We should be in accordance with the discrimination of the major participation of these new members and the ECAC in some cases that they have to be able to join the AC," said Conference President Alfred Rompuy.
For Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country is part of its civilian weapons in the country. The process is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
"We have been a major development of Bosnia and Herzegovina -- a major development for membership since three years," said Yves Lambert, co-ordinator of the project for the European Commission and International Airport for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Lamberg said the assessment was showed that the country has made major developments in the country, which was invited to join Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 2001.
NATO units have since ended the war in 1995, but the control has been slowly slowed by local authorities.
For example, a deal signed between SFOR and NGOs on July 1st was initiated by the SFOR Airport in Sarajevo, which was signed by civilian officials.
Initially, security, rescue and unrescue problems -- civil airport officials and municipal services -- have met their tasks in a airport exercise in May, when a air exercise was held in a air exercise.
Local authorities are preparing to take over the control of the Sarajevo Airport by the end of the year.
Thousands of foreign units have allowed the new Civilian Authority Committee to build the air control. The new unit will be linked to the High Representative and other ministries and airports.
The committee will be able to develop NGOs in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), enhance security and monitoring the process of monitoring the airport organisations, which are participating in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Lambert said that the project is not the final goal of the project, which is providing equality of its membership.
The Sarajevo Airport has removed its own air spending since 1 January, and the Banja Luka Airport has been consisting of its own control over the two years.
Mostar Airport is expected to have its own control by the end of 2003.
Another step forward is the participation of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (OHO), and this is the company of the Federation Airport in Europe.
The OHO is a comprehensive organisation to organise airport and airport operations.
"We must make progress in the field and other areas, but this is the next target that we need to reach," Lambert said.

Tourism Minister Bozidar Kalmeta expressed dissatisfaction with the level of preparations in some Croatian communities, due to delay.
At the same time, the government also focuses the problem of building control over the coastal coastal coastal coast and the fight against refugees.
Authorities say the transformation of illegal transportation has been improved due to a lack of investment.
The head of the Egyptian Committee, Thomas Croat, believes the creation of immunity is an important impact on the countries' ability to become successful in the international arena.
However, he says, tourism is only one of the sectors that will benefit from the areas of developing a country and development.
According to analysts, Croatia is continuing to improve its image of tourism, the European Commission will help boost foreign policy achievements such as the latest report on the development of tourism.

By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 11 / 08 / 10
Saric is estimated to win more than 100m euros in drug trafficking. [Getty Images]
Only four months after the latest indictment against him, Darko Saric has been charged with money laundering. On Monday (August 9th), Serbian prosecutors charged him with the drug paramilitary money and eight others in Vojvodina.
Among the disciplines, Saric and his wife Dubravka Strpka, Stevac, Stevka Copic, Andrija Kopic, Marinko Vujanovic, Predrag Vucic and Nebojsa Jovicevic.
So far, Saric and Copic are still under way.
According to Organised Crime Special Prosecutor Miljko Radisavljevic, about 20m euros have been sold from the sale of pyramids, while the banks were used for the privatisation of public companies.
According to Radisavljevic, the money was invested in Novi Sad, the Novi Sad company, Putnik, Mitrevska, the Mittica office in Mitrovica and Sulejman Palic companies.
The financial investigation into these companies has been investigated.
However, the defendants from Saric have not confirmed on drug trafficking, but they are responsible for illegal revenues and financial provisions.
Radisavljevic said that as part of this plan, there was a number of coastal companies to pay the accounts of local companies.
Most of the money was transferred to the Novi Sad Metror Bank.
Serbian media sources estimated that the cost of Saric will spend 100m euros from drug trafficking.
In April, special prosecutor Saric and South Africa accused 19 people suspected of involving 2.5 million people.
"Darko Saric and Zoran Copic are still at large, and we have suggested that they have suggested that they are being tried.
Prosecutors believe that the defendants should be tried in a single trial, due to the disappointment of the case, "he said.
If he was arrested and arrested, Saric could be sentenced to years in prison.
Serbia adopted a new money in March that aims to speed up the fight against corruption and meet international standards.

According to Montenegrin police director Veselin Veljovic, however, the indictment has made new information about the Balkans and that he is hiding to South Africa.

"This is not only the interests of Serbian police and state, but also the interest of all Balkan region," he said.

According to analysts, the possible division of RS
Political analysts say the pro-declaration of independence from Banja Luka could vote, but will not be able to decide.

Although authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have yet to start a campaign ahead of the October elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), authorities in Republika Srpska have started to push for the polls.
Authorities are expected to insist that Serbs are defended in BiH and that they could have to leave the country.
Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, leader of the ruling Democratic Union of Independent Social Democrats (SDSM) and Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, has repeatedly repeatedly revived the pro-declaration of independence, which has a majority majority in parliament.
Analysts say Dodik is a recent decision on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Kosovo. On July 22nd, the court said that Pristina is not the only unilateral declaration of independence.
The Bosnian Serb leader denied the division, but said it could be a long time.
"Everything is not the fight for RS, but for the status," Dodik said. "This is a battle for the status quo, and this could not be able to see that BiH is a country as a country.
Dodik and his party passed a law that allows a referendum on independence.
The law took effect on 20 April.
Sacola Palestinia, director of the University of Sarajevo, said the ICJ decision has sparked debate.
"In the coming years, there can be certain steps that are expected to be taken in order to ensure that RS would be able to ensure that Kosovo has its worst," he said.
Therefore, he said, BiH should take a step towards its own relations with Pristina.
"I believe the initiatives aimed at recognising Kosovo is the truth.
This is not important for Bosnian Croats and Croats in BiH, and this will not be a precondition for the situation of the country and the region, which will only help the situation in the region, "he said.
Banja Luka Foundation Director Miodrag Zivanovic said the aim of any isolation would be realised.
"This would mean that the RS people have been able to find itself under the sanctions, and the Serbs returned to BiH," Zivanovic said.
He and Zivanovic agree that Belgrade has a strong influence on the Bosnian Serb administration.
Zivanovic believes the effect of Belgrade on Banja Luka should be reduced "because the two countries need to have their own policies".
However, he says, "both the poor and good entity".
"The unity is the use of Belgrade to use RS.
If the same is, politicians in RS are not independent, they have no national strategic decisions.
Belgrade is a very serious and realistic international law, and this is better for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region, "he said.
Petroleum prices and improved economies revive global currency
Economists have repeatedly repeatedly criticised the rise of the prices in the 1970s, which are being seen in the oil prices.
Experts say that the market will be resolved, such as details, such as the risk of resources, while China and India are more complicated to the risk of increasingly competitive competitiveness and the risk of the global crisis.
In the past, technology developments and market forces have been sparked, although it has been smaller.
How can it be the same?
According to former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, policies should not be unable to see this issue as a result of economic, political, strategic and technological problems.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 02 / 01 / 06
Everything has started to concern, when the share of the Petroleum was over 50m.
In September, analysts began to see it as a preliminary assessment of the 60-65 level (60-65).
In general, it is clear that it is the same with the price of the price, which is the worst in the West economies ago.
At the same time, the Arab countries used this strategic strategy, economic and political weapons, and it has been used by more than 40,000 per cent of oil revenue.
This prices mean a serious change between the countries of oil exported countries and oil imports.
Our high oil prices are now questioning: the current situation is that it does not have a similar interest in the previous year? [File]
Foundation and industrial countries have slowed the oil prices (slowly slowly) and slowed their budget deficits, citing serious money.
The price of prices in industrial products has increased by oil prices.
The economic stalemate has been closed to 20 per cent before the US Central Bank (Paul Volfer) was replaced by the US Central Bank, and many of the crowds were transferred to the economy, as well as the risk of inflation.
As a result, a new scenario has been expanded to cover a new scandal. According to a new scenario, the armed system has the effective effect of resources to revive this economy.
In this case, the stalemate and high inflation will not be survived.
The crowd of Western economies can be said that the former communist countries have been affected by many years later.
Our amendments to the Western countries' strategies on strategic goods have been forced to stop institutional reforms and resources after the communist trade bloc was removed.
The former Soviet bloc countries have been more affected by the oil crisis, because the SNSB is useful oil.
The worst effects from the crisis are the poor countries that have been imported from oil, because these countries have been a lot of couple: a greater oil prices and prices.
Today 'high oil prices are now questioning: the current situation is that it does not show gas with the previous year?
At the same time, however, there is a problem that is more serious violence, such as Katina and Rita, such as natural disasters such as Katrina and Rita.
Furthermore, oil supplies have not been improved in recent years.
In politically, the political will be possible to ensure that there will be a removal in the market if the details on the measures are being implemented.
However, there is a major difference: the increase of Asian economies, especially in China and India, is a major pressure on oil and gas markets.
The price of prices in industrial products has increased by oil prices. [File]
How do you think that the new global economic scenario is the possible effect on the prices of the basic goods that are based on the functioning of social economies?
The fight against fight against corruption and more expensive prices could be selected in a poor scandal.
In a statement released by the Roman Club earlier this year, "I repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly revealed television and political discussions.
At the same time, the question of the question that the conditions in the monetary markets have been changed by the global circumstances (MIT), a professor of professor, Jaff Motter, was developed by the Forum Forum (MIT).
The Malthology commemoration has been sparked, even though the use of alternative energy resources for the new oil prices has been sparked by the forces of the market.
Do you think that technological safety is possible?
Both must participate in the account of China and India.
Despite pressure on Asian economies' oil and gas markets, the request will continue in the coming years.
Even if this situation, oil prices could be said to be said to be the news that the oil prices will not be exceeded at the same time.
In addition, the prices of prices are needed, but consumption and production are needed.
The worst effects in this case are still poor, especially for energy imports.
Public interests are possible.
With competitive competition on the control of oil and gas areas in the coming years, the process will be more important for the new regional areas, which will increase concerns about geopolitical and safety, and will be more important for the oil and gas, and specific economies of foreign policy.
At the time, the impact of the global environmental environment is more frequent and concerned, the army is the basic issue of technical issues that want to become more competitive in industrial companies.
The High oil and gas prices have slowly slowed and causing inflation.
Therefore, both companies and the governments have found significant markets that need to be sufficient policies and sufficient profits.
This new conditions could be a new participation in energy bill.
If the measures must be implemented, the private company and public budget will be more difficult, if they are not implemented in time.
Regional oil transport market faces more competitive
The energy issue continues to create a controversial debate in the world, while many Southeast European countries are hoping to see significant connections on oil pipelines.
At least three projects that have been delayed for years, the competitiveness in the regional oil transport market is on competition.

Many countries in the region have been on the energy market in Southeast Europe, where the Caspian oil role and the target of natural gas to the West -- the goal of continuing to continue with the projects of oil transportation projects.
The region has begun to reunify its oil pipelines, while at least three pipelines will strengthen local economies.
However, none of the projects did not support from the EU.
Several EU experts voiced concern that some pipelines would affect relations with the Union as a result.
At the same time, Brussels is not a reason that Brussels will be removed into the first project, and that it will have a connection with the rich Caspian Community, which has not yet been defined.
Petroleum experts think the latest decision by Moscow, which will be seen as the major oil role of Russian oil.
Many EU member states are concerned that Russia has stopped its oil exports.
As a result of Brussels, the competitiveness market in Southeast Europe is a more optimistic.
The first move was announced by the new initiative, which was launched in late January, was launched by the Pan European Petroleum (PEP).
As part of this initiative, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia will be linked to the Black Sea 'Commander in the Black Sea, Italy.
The pipeline will send control over the regional energy market, and will contribute to a major contribution to European and Middle East oil.
The news was announced during Italian Prime Minister Romo Prodi 'visit to Bucharest.
Prodi reiterated Romania &aposs support for the 130km pipeline.
According to supporters of the PEP, this initiative has a "conservative": There is at least two times more than in the current debt ", which has been linked to a current" external debt "in Tripoli.
Italian Prime Minister Rado Prodi vowed to support the PEP. [Getty Images]
The project has been waiting for years to reach a consensus on various issues, especially among some states.
As a result of the first feasibility study, the project was set by 2.4 billion euros.
The talks began in 1994, but there was no progress because of political conditions and regional conflict.
Furthermore, Italian daily Il Picolo said the project has been facing consensus due to financial resources and uncertainty decisions.
Rome and Bucharest have made clear that the project has been aware of the past decades, as well as for improving the development of the project.
The PEP has become a key target in Romania 'energy policy, due to more developed projects that have been approved by Russia' ratification of Russia.
One of the most important opponents of the PEP is the Black Sea pipeline, which will bring Russian oil to a Greek resort in the Black Sea coastal southern Bulgaria.
According to the Greek news agency ANA, the investment of the 285km pipeline is estimated to invest around 800m euros, and the annual capacity for the start of the start is 5m euros.
Following the years of consultations, the main supporters of the project have decided to take action in Greece, Russia and Bulgaria.
A three-entity working group, held in Bourgas, Bulgaria, has reached the first international agreement to build the pipeline.
Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Greece and Bulgaria to reach a final agreement before.
"If the Bulgarian and Greek partners do not provide a memorandum, we will have to do our exports to other countries, as Bulgaria and Greece are members of the EU, the EU should be interested in the implementation of this project," Putin said at a annual press conference on February 2nd.
According to many experts, Moscow is not only the latest movements of PEP, but also a third factor in the region, the AMBO pipeline, which is also a third factor in Bulgaria, Macedonia, Macedonia and Albania.
The third pipeline, signed in Skopje in late January, is planning to build the Caspian oil role in the Black Sea, Bulgaria 'expertise in Black Sea and then to the Albanian Mediterranean port in Vlora.
Following the past decade, the 850km pipeline is expected to be ready by the end of 2010, with the most optimistic scenario and a total of 1.3 billion cubic metres of electricity per year.

The leaders of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have launched a new page last week in relations between the two countries, as the leaders of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have decided to seek major relations.
Serbian President Boris Tadic and BiH Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic made a joint declaration underlining a "common visa-free" for the future.
The deal was made by Turkish President Abdullah Gul.
"The process of peace, stability and good neighbourly relations should be developed in a joint vision of our countries that can live in peacekeeping and peace," the statement said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has been pushing for months.
"This meeting is the first example of the Bosnian conflict," Davutoglu told the Sabak daily on 24 April.
For all, "security, high-level political dialogue, international economic independence, and the region" supports the protection of a multiethnic, multiethnic, multiethnic and multiethnic society ".
"The new Bosnian politicians in the region will affect the road to normalisation and stability of the region," Dusan Reljic, a researcher at the German Institute for International Affairs and Security in Berlin, told SETimes.
Aleksandar Fatic, head of the Belgrade Security Studies Centre, said the meeting would open the way for the establishment of direct communications with the Republika Srpska (RS), not through Belgrade authorities.
"The best ancient protection of good relations between Belgrade and Sarajevo is the best ancient to protect the RS status of the Dayton Peace Accords -- a potential conflict between the RS and Bosniak leaders in the Federation of BiH," Fatic told SETimes.
"Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina will not send the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina," Tadic said at a meeting of the weekend.
He emphasised that the new beginning would mean a new period to boost regional co-operation.
"It is very important," Silajdzic said.
Both countries are seeking to join the EU, which will help this compromise process.
Analysts say the meeting was strengthening the position of Turkey on its EU membership.
"Turkey aims to become one of the major foreign factors in Southeast Europe," Reljic said. "Turkey is aiming to become one of its medical diplomacy, economic and financial projects and financial projects in the region."
"It is not easy to see this point," Sami Kohen, a foreign policy editor of the Turkish daily Milliyet, said in a report on Tuesday (April 27th). "This meeting could be said that Davutoglu was said."
Banja Luka analyst Tanja Topic described the declaration as a strong step towards normalisation of regional relations.
The new political initiatives in this direction could cause the weakness of nationalist politicians in RS, he added.
"If the steps taken in the region in the past period are sustainable, Croatia and Serbia can be suspended by this negative reactions, and this will soon become the political victims of RS," Topic told SETimes.
The accord was not made without negative corruption.
Nebojsa Radmanovic, a member of the BiH presidency, described Silajdzic as the constitution due to the declaration that Silajdzic was signed by other presidency members.
"Silajdzic and Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj have been in Istanbul for an official visit to Istanbul, and now they cannot accept any documents in BiH," Radmanovic said.
He said that this response "shows that RS leaders" fear that there is a huge stake in relations with Serbia ".
At the meeting, Gul was the importance of building regional relations and continuing.
"The Balkans have always been peacekeeping and stability -- this time we are very important -- the EU and NATO structures will be very important," Gul said. "The normalisation of relations between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina."
Milan, a 71, said Serbs are not easy to hold their concerns against Turkey.
"We know that the first relationship on Turkish relations is in Serbia -- we have limited by 500 years," said Milan. "However, there are many changes since then.
If we will invest in Serbia, we have a few billion-euro problem. "

Following the independence of Montenegro, two years later, the debate on the liberalisation of the asylum laws in the small Adriatic country is increasing concerns about a large amount of biometric purchase in the country.
The Democratic Party of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic -- the party of Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic -- was completely liberalised.
However, the Social Democratic Party, the other partner of the coalition, is opposed with the opposition, which wants to continue restricting restrictions on the coastal coastal part of the country.
Since the controversial debate on this issue, the government has resigned a draft law on the rights of foreign ministers.
According to the constitution, such a law must provide a two-thirds majority for parliament.
As part of the current law, foreign commercial personnel can buy refugee in Montenegro, while foreign investors have no rights.
Bogdin is also planning to restrict such restrictions, with many foreign recognition -- a company with the purchase of Montenegro.
A government court in Montenegro said that "no foreign people who do not have an economic operational in Montenegro" will not have a chance.
However, this decision is not recognised as unacceptable.
Statistical data proved the importance of this issue. The number of Foreign Investments, worth 900m euros, was called for 53 per cent of the investment.
Meanwhile, the amount of disease from the country has reached 450m euros -- the amount of amounts to the amount of investment.
Officials who sell their owners are selling to buy the sale, attracting foreign trade deficit and use new investments in new investments -- including Belgrade and Novi Sad -- as well as to buy the disaster from the country, including Belgrade and Novi Sad.
Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic, who is responsible for international economic relations, rejected the government "refusing to sign the mechanism of reconciliation".
"In the law, there should be a similar idea on the state of goods and forests in the coastal part of the law," said Djurovic, arguing that "In the law, some special judges should be used in the framework that will be recognised by the public goods, summer and other contractions."
However, President Branko Radulovic, the Association of Affairs, believes that he is not "a strong claim".
"I think that the smaller of Montenegro is 13.12km, I am suspected that the circumstances will be able to protect the country ’ s interests.
For example, Russia is completely completely unfair, "he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic, who is responsible for international economic relations, vowed to sign the government "substantial mechanism", adding that "there is no need for reconciliation conditions". [Montenegrin government]
"Montenegro can use the image of foreign investors, such as Bulgaria," Radulovic said. "Bulgaria has signed an agreement with foreign investors -- which is not planning to use this summer, allowing investors to use them for 99 years.
In this case, it was the only way to protect the territorial weapons, and other agreements that have been removed, "he said.
Predrag Mitrovic, head of the Association of Community, warns that the state should be taken into account the experience of other countries in the region.
"Other countries with liberal laws have sold their territory in terms of discrimination from abroad, and they have made it clear that they are in charge of [economic].
Such liberalisation laws should be dangerous for smaller states such as Montenegro, and I think that the state should be more active on this issue, "he said.
The finance ministry adviser Predrag Stamatovic believes that this idea will not restrict the rights of individual refugees, including the state, the judges' rights.
"How do you have the right to see the way of the development of the development and foreign capital," Stamatovic said last year, noting that the tax revenue of the budget revenue of tax revenue was 40m euros in the budget.
Following recent talks with the EU on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement last year, Montenegro has decided to open its citizens of EU countries.
The deal is expected to be implemented in 2010 after the 27 EU member states approved by parliament.
Montenegro will start talks on all chapters of the facility as a candidate for EU membership.
The European Commission will assess Montenegro laws and assess that the EU criteria are met.
The rights of EU citizens will be discussed as part of the free movement of goods, goods and capital.
In the past, these chapters have been the most difficult process for candidate countries who want to give the right to asylum.
Croatia, for example, has not been unable to discuss talks on the free movement of capital.
European Commission experts have vowed that Croatian laws are not in accordance with European standards in the next two years.
According to the EC, Croatia is slowly slowly slowly to the "legal amendments", which would allow EU citizens to be able to secure the island in Croatia ".
However, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and other documents need to complete the visa liberalisation process by 2009.
Germany, Belgium, Britain, France, the Netherlands and Spanish citizens could be in Croatia as a result of reconciliation agreements.
However, the process has been able to take over two years due to the management climate.
Therefore, the methods in the country have applied in Montenegro, and a company in Croatia has established a company, and it is seeking any restrictions.
All new members of the EU are trying to lift the balance of foreign tourists, as they were held with the EC.
These initiatives were Malta.
There is no one who lives in Malta for at least five years, but it is not the right to buy a second consumption in the country, but also for the citizens living abroad.

"I have a single question that Radovan Karadzic will be a single question, but it will be better to continue to live in the life, or to hand over to The Hague," said US movie Radoje Radovic, a leading journalist at the Serbian Orthodox Church. [File]
One of the leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church (PASOK) urged Radovan Karadzic to hand over the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).

"I think that this is a decision and I would like to ask that one of them 'own idea' own idea," the US film quoted Karadzic as saying. "However, I expect it to decide that this decision," he expects the Bosnian Serbs to decide on the responsibility of their responsibility.
"I expect the same responsibility to take the same responsibility."
The ICTY leader accused the former Bosnian Serb leader of more than 10 years ago for his role in the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Karadzic, meanwhile, faces two counts of genocide against the 43-month Sarajevo massacre and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.

Following the attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, authorities in Ankara have launched a new strategy to resolve the problem.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a solution to Diyarbakir earlier this month was aimed at strengthening democracy.
Following that, the Turkish National Security Council (MGK) met to discuss new measures aimed at developing the Anatolian region, which has been under the conflict with the PKK for 20 years.
According to a report by CEC Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the incidents reflect the division of the PKK if the organisations are in a precondition for the future.
Another reason is the new terrorism law, which is expected to take effect in September in Turkey.
Thousands of people died in 1999, after the PKK 'campaign was completed. Following the arrest of President Abdullah Ocalan in 1999, the organisation declared the unilateral declaration.
However, in June 2005, it decided to continue the fight against the armed forces in the southern part of Turkey, especially in the majority of the Kurdish population.
The civil society organisations and some Kurdish rebels have called on the PPK to send weapons, while they are concerned about the female of the communities' resignation.
The former Democratic Party (DEP) lawmakers, Ljube Zana, Orhan Dodik, Thessaloniki and Hadzak, have asked the PKK to declare a new Kurdish political movement that has been met from the PKK.
Meanwhile, the prime minister stressed that the threat of violence could be resolved through reconciliation.
"The Kurdish problem should be resolved", Erdogan has received support from the 15-nation Kurdish community, the group and the District Democracy Plan to Erdogan, where some opposition nationalists and some opposition politicians are willing to criticise criticism.
Regional rights are among the problems that Turkey has to join the EU on 3 October, which plans to start accession talks.
The country has allocated some reforms, including the removal of broadcasting and education in the Kurdish province.
At least one PKK leader seems to respond to these initiatives.
At the same time, a former DEP MP, Zdrajaj, declared a five-month letter, and said the latest steps that Ankara had been shown is a sign of the government.

By Brian Sale for Southeast European Times in Podgorica -- 03 / 08 / 09
"In the next five years, Southeast European countries will be in Europe," said SNP leader Srdjan Milic. [REF / RL / RL]
Srdjan Milic, leader of the opposition Socialist Party (SNP), told parliament on October 3rd 2008 that Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic was convinced about the average evidence that Kosovo is the issue of recognition.
"Montenegro can recognise Kosovo next day," Milic said.
Following this statement, Montenegro recognised the former Serbian province as an independent country.
The SNP is the largest part of the support of Montenegro -- about 30 per cent of the population.
The SNP, which won 5445 votes in March 2009, has 16 seats in parliament.
"The Albanian issue in Montenegro has not yet closed.
We will expect the International Court of Justice in The Hague to wait. "
Montenegro questions NATO membership
In December 14th 2006, the country is not the only problem for the status of Kosovo. In December 14th 2006, Montenegro joined the Partnership for Peace programme as one of its first steps towards full membership. In 1999, the intervention in the Balkans is still a major factor and state.

"I think that Montenegro will join NATO two years ago," Milic said, adding that "I think that we will be able to surrender."
Milic says that the SNP has not yet discussed a final meeting on NATO membership, and that the volunteers will not be able to leave their opinion on this issue.
However, a survey by the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (CEDEM) showed that 30 per cent of participants supported NATO membership, while 43.3 per cent oppose any opinion on the issue.
The figures have not changed more than 4 per cent since October 2007, when the CEDEM began talks on Montenegro.
Milic says NATO has changed in the last ten years after a three-month military movement against Serbia and Montenegro, under which the state union is in the period.
Therefore, efforts to support citizens on the Alliance membership could not be a lot of interest.
"I do not know that NATO was in 1999," the opposition leader said.
According to CEDEM, a small majority of Montenegrin citizens are not in the same idea with Milosevic.
The participants say NATO is "a military organisation", 30.6 per cent of the participants think it is a "military / political organisation", while 1.7 per cent think it is a military organisation.
"I think that we are doing a world that we are seeking to solve the natural disasters, and I think we are doing a world that we are trying to solve the social problems and to resolve the island of NATO and the Warsaw Plan," Milic said.
According to Milic, about 50 per cent of Montenegro are not important for defence and NATO relations, and that the public should be discussed. "This is a matter that should be done.
"We have to convince the players, and we should not be convicted on this issue," he said.
Montenegro hopes for EU membership

Milic was closed last week as head of the National Council for European Integration.
"The next five years will be in Europe," said Milic, a strong believe that the country can join the Union.
"In 1990, the EU was closed.
Most young and young politicians have been in politics, but this process has lost 18-19 years.
Bytyci was a swimming.
"I don ’ t want to see the worst."
Milic, however, believes that Montenegro should be able to meet EU standards. "We have to say that this process should be able to do so." I don '' '' '' '' opinion that we will be accepted in 2011. "
"Montenegro can create a success in Europe, but we have to ensure that the Montenegrin citizens of Montenegro will be able to integration into Euro-Atlantic integration," he said.
Regional peacekeeping steps
"How can you allow the children to go into a Albanian house?" he said.
"This is not a lot," Milic said.
"I do not want to reveal us," he said after the hearing.
Following the NATO movement for the Balkans, a former Albanian friendship is on March 23rd 1999.
After a few hours later, Milic will be the first bombings near 10.
Milic and his friends were training in Dubrovnik, Croatia and his friends have lived in Germany for the past nine years, "he said." I can know that we will be able to see.
"The Lebanon [is] sent to me to me."
"This is a truth and I hope that the peace in this region can be reached," Milic said.

The negotiations are expected to take place before the sides are scheduled to start negotiations.
"It is very good to find a solution (very good) and the first different sides in the first time," Reuters quoted Ahtisaari as saying in an interview with the Fund 'national President YLE on Monday.
"We need to discuss how such problems can be resolved.
"There are many basic jobs that should start a specific debate."

Serbia has made it clear on Monday (April 14th) that the elections will violate the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and that the local elections in Kosovo are in place next month, despite warnings that illegal immigration will be used.
UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker insists that only the UN has the right to hold elections in Kosovo.
However, Ruecker said Serbia could help organisations in the areas of the Serb population in the province, which will be held by the UN this year, and agreed that Belgrade would ask the right to hold parliamentary elections in Kosovo.
"The local elections in Kosovo will be in line with the UN Security Council Resolution 1244," Recker said in a letter to Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic 'plans for elections in Kosovo. "However, the local elections will be based on the UN Security Council decision."
The Serbian local and parliamentary elections will take place on 11 May.
A decision by the Serbian election commissioner on Monday (February 17th) is on the basis for the organisation of local elections in Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia.

"The UNMIK Security Council will not hold 1244 members of the local elections in Kosovo and will not be able to hold local elections for Serbs in Kosovo," the government quoted Samardzic as saying.
The pressure on Belgrade to hold local elections in Kosovo has sparked criticism from ethnic Albanian leaders in Pristina.
As a initiative to promote the new state of Europe, leaders urged UNMIK to prevent the vote.
"Independent is a electoral area for all citizens of Kosovo," President Fatmir Sejdiu said. "It is responsibility for UNMIK to respond to such initiatives to block stability in Kosovo and promote the institution."
For UNMIK and KFOR to block the voting of Kosovo Serbs in the local elections, international officials say it will not recognise the election results.
The UN mission spokesperson Sven Letry Balkan Insight reported that UNMIK has not sent any response to Belgrade authorities, but that the local elections in Kosovo will be acceptable, "the Balkan Insight quoted him as saying.

Among 144 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the 144 municipalities could be disappointed as a disappointment of almost 61% of the public.

The DTEIB is currently the only position of agriculture ministers and agencies, as well as representatives of the European Commission and the European Commission for co-operation with the state level.
According to BiH Deputy Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Minister Vilim Priokac, the agriculture sector has been a stable growth in the last five years, and it has declined in the sector over the last two years.
"We believe that this year will be a turning point, because BiH is preparing to join the World Trade Organisation, the country signed CEFTA and will sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
We will have the number of BiH exports to the opening of a 6m-euro market.
However, we must make our farmers more efficient and competitive, "he said.
BiH is more than 15% of its territory, especially by the private sector.
The most popular territory is in the north of the Prova River.
In more mountainous areas, territory and agriculture are being used for agriculture.

In BiH and Bosnia and Herzegovina, all areas of protection are being taken.
The main photography, especially in the season.
About 10% of the agriculture sector during the 1992-1995 conflict.
One of the main obstacles for the restructuring is that the country is still in any way, and other explosive ammunition.

Southeast European Times: The European Commission (EC) described Romania as an effective market economy.
This is only a "diplomat", which has been repeatedly suggested in experts?
Vasilas: This is not a "diplomatic mission".
We have been able to fulfil the basic criteria for all the prices of inflation rates and to ensure that a effective market economy is stable, and we have reached all targets.
Poland and and and Bulgaria, which was the same candidate status in 1997 and 2002, were replaced by the criteria.
SETimes: There is no need for the Romanian economy to be in a single European market, the EC said in a report.
Puscas: In 1993, the EU criteria have been established, while transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe have been taken into account.
The countries are expected to reach an effective market economy. If the reforms are continued, the reforms will have a higher competitiveness.
SETimes: Do you think that the Romanian economy will be able to achieve its capacity with competitiveness in the future?
Romania hopes to join the EU in 2007. [EU]
Puscas: This is necessary.
We will have to see our player in the EU market, with our own competitiveness system and our own products, which will have to come to a broad market with 500m euros.
"I want to emphasise that Romania can win state status in 2007.
SETimes: How can you complete negotiations on the Justice and Reconstruction issues by the end of the year?
Puscas: The commission "has been used for any efforts" to complete the negotiations by the end of the year.
So far, the negotiations have been a joint target for the end of 2004.
Following talks in December, the Council of Europe will assess the issue of Bulgaria and Romania.
SETimes: The latest country report includes criticism of media freedom and corruption.
Do you think that criticism are unrealistic?
Puscas: We are really disappointed.
"We should be very active because this report is not the top negotiating team or target all Romanian people.
The government must promote necessary measures to ensure freedom of press freedom, and implementation of legal arrangements.
We have to block these criticism and criticism from other sectors, because the freedom of expression is more broad.
SETimes: The "high-level corruption" was part of the Committee report in 2003.
Earlier, it was not used.
Puscas: Anti-corruption issue is needed to address the issue.
We are acting such a approach and we are aware of the National Assistance for Corruption.
Corruption is not only a balance or political issue.
The competitiveness system will strengthen competitiveness, corruption.
SETimes: We acknowledged that the accession Agreement would accept a "security requirement", which allows Romania to join a year if they fulfil its principles.
Can the EU, which aims to ensure that reforms are completed after the negotiations are completed, was affected by the adoption of the requirement?
Puscas: The justice, interior and agriculture issues for ten new member states have taken effect.
The different implementation of Bulgaria and Romania is a security requirement to recognise the accession date as a year, if the results in the medical process are not expected, the results are not expected.
SETimes: The November elections will be held.
Can the government changed the negotiations and accession process?
Puscas: We hope that all technical solutions will be made by the elections.
I hope that policies in the coming period will be able to resume the negotiation process and that the process will move towards natural gas by December.

EU presence in the region is important.
This could be assessed in a strategic visa-free visa for economic and trade agreements and workers.
Wolfenny noted that the World Bank is a lot of 5 billion euros in the world.
This is not mean that the Bank does not cover a variety of aid to the region, but Wolfennson has repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly revealed that Europe is not only in Europe, and the EU should take more responsibility for its strategic interests.

In Southeast Europe, the political, institutional and economic situation is a lot of job.
However, the change is a major step towards continuing EU accession, political and economic transformation.

Following the four years of expectations, Serbia has approved the EU candidacy last week.
The state officials, led by President Boris Tadic, agree that candidate status is a better life of Serbian citizens, more investments, new jobs and better living standards.
However, economic analyst Miroslav Zdravkovic believes that this expectations are not realistic.
"The EU countries have a decrease in the global production -- the situation is the right to see the disaster in late 2008 and the beginning of 2009.
Therefore, the new jobs and investments in Serbia are not realistic to wait, "he said." I don [I don] did not see any special achievements because of the candidacy of Serbia. "
Many bloggers believe the candidacy is positive.

He believes that nothing has been given to Serbia for a long time.
"Bravo.
Serbia must now be completely unacceptable and future.
The next step is the start of talks and there should be many issues so far.
"We have started with the elections to see how they will do, and then we will continue to go on this point."
However, Denis said, the candidacy is a long time for full membership, and that other countries in the region are more important than Serbia on European integration.

Romanian bloggers are worriing that debate, and they are trying to give some.
"The rights of minorities is a problem of Romania, and what is a problem of Europe?" Laura Cerchi says.
"So far, so far, this is a European problem, and it was said to have much more than all other countries in the region, in order to monitor the minority rights of Romania," he says.

President Fatmir Sejdiu said independence is symbolically symbolically symbolic of the former Yugoslavia, which has been caused for long-term conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.
"Now it is time to work for a compromise and consensus," Sejdiu said.
"We have the first time we have a framework that allows freedom and neighbouring [Serbia]] growth to protect us," said former Kosovo journalist Veton Syroi.
However, the people of Kosovo have started to repeat this optimism, due to their difference.
Economic unemployment and young state have no need to provide an agreement with the UN Security Council.
Russia condemned the move of Pristina, and has been divided with many of the EU and that many members would refuse to recognise or refuse.
Former US envoy for the Balkans Richard Holbrooke said the leaders should work together to prevent the situation.
"The new state has been unacceptable to Serbs.
However, the government in Albanians and Pristina must not see the poor of Serbs, protecting historic and cultural heritage and to protect the lives of Albanian neighbours, "he said.
The EU has sent a 1800-strong mission to Kosovo to help the judiciary and police.
The mission will also be formed in a key political company, which is being implemented by the Ahtisaari plan.
According to political analyst Arben Cafet, Europe can help Kosovo become a step forward.

Turkey seems to worry about developments in neighbouring Iran.
Media reports emphasised the allegations and electoral fraud, while the government is a comprehensive policy aimed at protecting public relations.
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Monday (June 15th) that the government had no doubts about how to see the situation.
"Iran is a very important neighbouring country for our political stability," Davutoglu said.
"The controversial controversial discussions on election results are Iran.
We hope that this debate will end as soon as possible, and we hope that the discrimination between Turkey and Iran will continue as soon as possible, "he added.
Davutoglu repeatedly criticised Iranian security forces' claims or voting, praised the "symbolic" and high turnout in the election.
Iran and Turkey lived in their relations in 1980 and 1990s.
Turks are suspected of trying to undermine their own ethnic communities, while Tehran accused Ankara of disappointing the opposition against the Iranian regime, including ethnic Azerbaijan.
Since 2000, however, relations have been restricted, and the trade deficit between the two countries has been frozen by 1.11 billion euros last year.
Discussions between Turkey and Iran are important -- about a million Iran visits Turkey every year.
Turkish special television channels are simply popular in Iran, and students in the region are sceptical to Turkey.
At the same time, more than 30,000 Iranian soldiers are living in Turkey, with UNHCR statistics showed that about 30,000 Iranians have fought to Turkey between 1994 and 2005.
The political Islam in Turkey is one of the factors.
Despite most of Turkish Muslims, the Safii model has a major interest in the Islamic state, and all major Islamic political figures have formed relations with Tehran.
Both Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul celebrated Iranian leader Mehmet Ahmejad for mobile phone results, while Turkey was one of the first countries in the world.
The Turkish media, meanwhile, showed that Iranian protesters and them are more optimistic to support real democracy in Iran.
"Reforms have not been calling for the streets, despite the streets," the Liberal Radical daily quoted him as saying.
Ceyin Karan, who told Tehran, said Iran is facing the largest public protests since the 1979 conflict.
About 170 reforms were arrested and many foreign journalists are facing restrictions and laws.
Meanwhile, the daily Bujar called for the support of his candidacy, Musevic 'supporters' supporters' ''.
However, Cesel, a journalist of the Hurriyet daily Hurriyet, argued that the electoral corruption is not enough to submit the outcome in Iran.
Officials argue that if they do so in the elections, Ahtisaari has a strong support for Ahtisaari.
"Many observers from the world showed that the economic situation is not satisfied with the economic situation and supports reforms and integration into the Western world," wrote Monday.
"These observers do not know the importance of the ideology, especially the Islamic political ideology."
"Of course, no one should change the idea that the United States, Israel, Israel and the EU should not be able to stop a nuclear attack against the EU.
"The Middle East is ready to play a lot," he added, adding that "Middle East is waiting for many days."

Croatian and Slovenian foreign ministers have not agreed on a long-standing border dispute between their countries in Luxembourg on Monday (June 15th) with EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn.
"We have decided to resolve a solution today and to continue our talks," Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic said after the meeting.
Talks focused on the latest proposal for the dispute over the two countries' declaration of independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.

Slovenia, which joined the Union in 2004, has been blocking the opening of new chapters between Croatia and Brussels since December 2008.
The country has threatened to block the process without resolving the border dispute.
Analysts warn that the stalemate could be dangerous by the end of this year. The Balkan country, which hopes to complete accession talks, such as Croatia, will be able to complete its accession talks by the end of 2011, has already closed only seven negotiating chapters since 2011.
In an attempt to end the disappointment, Rehn proposed a deal that envisions the establishment of a special international law to resolve the dispute in April.
Croatia has accepted it as "a bit or no".
However, politicians in Slovenia have not been recognised as an open Mediterranean country, and this is not satisfied with the plan, saying it could block the country to provide direct access to international transportation in the north.
In May, Slovenia submitted proposals for Rehn 'proposal.
Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor described the amendments as "important" for the interests of his country, warning that Ljubljana could reject the proposal.
On Monday, Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbot said that some of the recommendations were sent to Brussels last month.

Rehn said on Thursday that a solution should be reached before a two-day EU summit in Brussels.
Following a new meeting on Wednesday, he added, the two ministers will be held in their countries.
"We can produce more, but we have a very detailed study," the DPA quoted Rehn as saying.
Pahor told reporters in Ljubljana that the plan is "satisfied with the new tender", adding that the plan would reflect national interests in both countries.
"This can be ready for a clear solution that will be able to make common borders," the AFP quoted the Slovenian prime minister as saying.

Our small economies, such as Montenegro, seems to be more difficult.
Dragana, a economist at the University of Podgorica earlier, says there is no job because there is no longer recognition in their positions, but there is no information and intelligence.
The legal factor, Zoran, is at the same time, and there is no longer a High average, is a job in the field of expertise in a legal firm, which has been transferred to the state and state borders.
Many business applications were unacceptable.
Among the universities in Montenegro, many of them are possible.
Public disappointments and insufficient competitiveness have been disappointed because of a lack of competitiveness.
The areas are different ways.
They are working in their own areas to prove their own, and the new political situation in Montenegro -- will improve the conditions in the business market.
There is no other reason for business opportunities in the country, but also in other parts of the country.
The most popular circumstances can be united with the job and salaries, and the majority of the group is working for foreign companies.
Some are continuing to work in accordance with a climate of job, which is possible to spend their families as possible.

Other events, such as the Year, are the potential to address the unemployment problem, which is a major obstacle to immigration of the young population in Montenegro and a major obstacle to economic development.
However, all of the business circumstances are not the only way.
Milica, a student of Britain, vowed to create business opportunities, but people who have been able to stop their hotels that "everything" is open ".

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which has a complicated government structure, is facing a serious slowdown on progress in recent months.
Last year 'election campaign continues to return to pro-nationalis-nationalism, and the political scandal continues to be completed.
The EU says it is clear that the country can move forward on accession, it is clear that significant reforms aimed at strengthening state institutions.
The current state structure of three national and two sides is a result of the Dayton Agreement, which ended in 1995.
The Dayton Accord says many observers are unsatisfied with the political system, which was established with the agreement, is unfair, expensive, expensive, expenditures and intolerance with EU standards.
However, it seems to seek political will to change this system.
The responsibility for this stalemate is politics, but observers agree that both sides are the biggest stake in the current climate, Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, the leader of the Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), who won a major victory in the 2006 elections, argued that the Bosnian Serb entity 'Union of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD)
"The RS is the only concern.
For this reason, BiH has repeatedly informed the Dayton Accord.
I respect the agreement, "Dodik said in another speech, describing BiH as a" factor that does not block the development of RS ".
Local and foreign politicians have criticised Dodik for failing to make a solution to the Bosnian Serb entity.
During the election campaign, Bosniak politicians have called for the RS to be removed.
Dodik also criticised these calls for a independence referendum.
Bosnian Serb representatives in the RS Parliament and the Bosnian Serb entity in BiH have warned that they could require the extradition of all powers in the past decades and to be extradited to the state.
Reforms say the current police system is allowing the entity borders to justice. [Getty Images]
"If the requests for the RS be removed, we want to exercise our authority on the Office of the High Representative and Prosecutors' Council," RS President Milan Jelic said.
Dodik and SNSD argues that the RS will be a federal unit for BiH, but it is not a state structure of the central government.
Dodik claims that the country will see as a single electoral union of the completion of the country, and that the Bosniaks will be respected, if it will be able to see a single democratic approach.
Dodik believes the economy is the most important for the future of the Bosnian Serb entity.
Dodik, who was in the world near Banja Luka on March 1959, was the Belgrade University of Political Affairs Foundation for Political Affairs. He served as a representative of the RS National Assembly during the war in 1980.
During the presidency of war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic, the ruling Democratic Party of Serbia (SDS) has formed the Contact Group for Independent Parliament, the only political opposition to the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS).
The group, which was headed by Dodik, was elected by the RS Parliament in 1997.
In January 1998, RS President Biljana Plavsic was nominated as prime minister.
Dodik [cabinet] was in office until January 2001.
Dodik, who is trying to strengthen the political party, has also criticised the SDS.
Dodik also cited the international community in BiH as an important alternative to nationalist conservatives.
Dodik, who served as prime minister in February 2006, promised that RS will protect its presence.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the EU is not possible to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina, without an agreement on police reform. [Getty Images]
"In 1996, Dodik [war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic] have been a clear political will," says Tanja Topic, a political analyst at the Foundation in Banja Luka.
However, the pragmagazine is a high-ranking and a political businessman, and it has already entered a popular political approach that supports him, "he said.
According to Topic, the restructuring of nationalists is a lot of reasons.
One is that the basic principles are unchanged.
According to Topic, RS citizens have been training for years, as well as the political and political will of the Bosnian Serb side.
He also believes that the international community is very high and that the current structure of Bosnian Serbs is very high, and that the money could be more beneficial in social programmes, such as social programmes.
One of the effects of the idea of the independence referendum in RS is controversial debate on the status of Kosovo, Topic said, adding that Serbian policemen use RS to obtain independence.
In terms of citizens of both sides, there is no reason that BiH is in the EU.
Police reform is still the most important precondition for the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU this year.
The reform, however, is a long time because Dodik 'stance on protecting police officers in the entity level.
In addition, RS representatives are opposed to the request for NATO to keep the Civilian Protection Corporation.
"BiH is simply simply between both sides of the constitutional structure.
One of these bills is that the entities continue to continue the presence of RS.
It is difficult to find a solution and now that the international community has been in a comprehensive position on this issue, "he said.
According to Topic, the international community has shown a sovereignty, and the previous High Representative (Paddy Ashdown), which has been used by the international community, and the two previous High Representative (Paddy Ashdown), should be a factor between local politicians and Christian Schwarz-Schwarz-Schilling, who has been used to resolve the dispute with public officials.
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, who served in July, has been criticised by Dodik, and also criticised Dodik 'proposal for the RS state union.
In a statement last month, Lajcak said the prime minister "should show that Bosnia and Herzegovina should not be able to ask its constitution and the Dayton Peace Accord with remarks that the international community does not want to do."
The police reform was set as the end of September to reach an agreement.
If political leaders do not reach a compromise on this issue, the SAA will not be signed this year, and the country will send its EU candidacy.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is facing the risk of its neighbours and the European competition," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said.

Reforms in Turkey continue to opposition
While authorities started to improve the problems of the Kurdistan Kurds, the PKK has the need for terrorist campaign?

The Turkish government has promised a new policy against the Kurdistan Workers' Party, although the Kurdistan Workers' Party 'reactions against terrorism.
A new government plan, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has announced his decision to improve economic development in the southeastern Turkey, where he lives in the PKK campaign in northern Iraq, announced it has announced a new and a new government plan for various investments, including improving economic development.
He reiterated that a new state television will start broadcasting on a new state broadcaster, and repeatedly repeatedly punished the PKK members to punish information on war and organisations.
The Erdogan administration is hoping to block the PKK 'objections, while the Kurdistan Kurds in Turkey have shown their concerns, while the PKK hopes to block them.
However, the terrorist organisation insists that this efforts are the only option of "continuing", which is the death of the death and deaths.
According to Krasniqi, a member of the organisations of the organisation, Erdogan "is no other than the situation of the Kurdish political policy."
The PKK, which requests the establishment of a "public republic" in the north of Turkey in 1970, wants to establish a independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq and Syria, as well as a part of a part of Iran and Syria.
The organisation is seeking to create the support of the Kurds in Turkey, which is seeking to strengthen the government policies, which are under pressure on economic uncertainty and Kurdish nationalism.
The organisation is also seeking to bring political force from Turkey, which is under border attacks against the PKK campaign in northern Iraq.
"The Turkish military continues to fight the PKK, while the government will continue to fight Kurdish politics in the fields of political, economic and society," Kalfin said in a statement issued by a Observer website.
Will such allegations are still at large?
Authorities in Turkey have taken concrete steps to reduce the liquidity on minority rights in recent years, including links to the EU.
Following the death, the first time of the Kurdish case -- a political party connected with the PKK, according to the allegations of many officials in Ankara.
The government emphasised the importance of the unilateral military actions against terrorism and that the disappointment of the Kurds should be discussed.
In addition, NGOs are working to find a political solution in the framework of the problem, but violence continued in the last five years.

Among the disputes, sparks false.
This month, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (KCK), which includes many illegal organisations, called for dialogue with the Turkish government.
However, if the demands are not fulfilled, it warned that "a war" will be done for years.
Meanwhile, the organisation claims that they want to negotiate the situation, is also questioning Turkey 'principles and territorial integrity, and this is described by Turkish officials as completely unacceptable.
The PKK has declared the only unilateral ceasefire in the past, but no one has continued.
Therefore, the reason is likely to be tried.
The different groups are optimistic and some influential forces in the PKK see violence as a way to achieve the goal.
If the KCK called for dialogue, PKK commander Bahiri Erkal said the attacks against Turkish soldiers and other goals would continue.
"The war environment can be sustainable, and this is the only way to ensure that the Kurds can gain political winners," he said.
PKK is weak, but dangerous situation
"The PKK is the most dangerous, but this is the most dangerous.
"The terrorist organisation, which is under pressure, can try to demonstrate the number of people attacks and use the attacks," he said.
Turkey, which has organised military operations against PKK terrorists in northern Iraq since December, organised a five-day move that was killed by the General Staff in February, was killed by at least 40 terrorists.
Latiner says that the PKK has become a successful military action and fraud, as well as slogistic and financial resources.
He added that the organisation is now at the same time.
As a result, the organisation could try to support the global or regional players who use him as a "unique" for the implementation of regional policies.
The PKK has sparked a sovereignty in the region and its operations in Europe in this framework.
According to the US State Department on Terrorism Report in April 2007, the organisations' financing are helping the financing of drug and human trafficking activities in Europe, as well as money from the organisations.
Several international security experts in both international and international areas say the PKK threat is no longer possible to resolve a military solution.
Turkey must continue to work together with other countries, especially in Europe to avoid financial sources.
In the meantime, the government must ensure the security of the Kurds' civil society and the rule of law.
The economic restructuring is one of the problem that the PKK is in the past.
At the same time, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a 15-billion-euro plan to boost investment in southeastern Turkey and improve economic development.
Another challenge is that Turkey is in order to ensure security in the past several years.
The PKK has made it clear that the Kurds are discriminated and that the Kurdistan Workers' repeatedly voted in the last year.
A controversial controversial controversial debate in Turkey, which has been caused by Kurdistan and television programmes.
In 2004, the limited Kurdistan broadcaster began.
Erdogan says it is planning to attract more transportation.
A television station will be formed as a special television station, but also the Kurdistan and Farmar.
The government will continue new reforms, the prime minister said, adding that one of the deputy prime minister has been serving as a clear students in the region.

DTP says the government programme is insufficient
The Turkish government is still facing details.
The pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) says the work was not affected.
"We must speak without the session and restrictions.
"If the AKP government is unhappy to resolve the Kurdish problem, I questioned the demands of the Kurdish people."
The DTP wants Turkey to recognise the Kurdish identity through the constitution and the establishment of a free administration in the southeastern province.
The DTP 'basic pillars between the PKK and PKK demands are unimpossible for dialogue between the government and the main Kurdish party in Turkey.
Erdogan faces a strong public pressure on PKK terrorism and has to do everything about the prime minister.
Earlier, Erdogan denied his request for talks with his party, saying he would not meet with the DTP as a terrorist organisation and unless they did not see the PKK as a clear threat.
The public 'attack against the PKK has been high since at least 47 people were killed in terrorist attacks, including at least 35 soldiers in October.
The PKK has been more than 37,000 people since 1984.
The DTP, meanwhile, is increasing evidence that the PKK is different from the PKK, has caused the party in ethnic Kurds.
In November 2007, the Metropoll research group launched a public research in the southeastern province.
More than 35.1 per cent of the participants showed that the DTP does not represent ethnic Kurds, while only 38.6 per cent said the party represents full representation.
According to Metropoll, the DTP "political will to resolve the democratic rights and Kurdish problem.
However, the party has been facing a very negative criticism because of the recent terrorist actions. "According to researchers, the party is not a terrorist organisation by the PKK.
The results showed that support for the PKK 'targets is at least.
The majority (6.5 per cent) opposes the establishment of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq, while 95.2 per cent said they are willing to stay in Turkey without a state.
More than half of the participants (55 per cent) said the border operation for the PKK campaign in northern Iraq is necessary.
Over 60 per cent of the participants said they were in politics.
Opposition polls said that 65 per cent of the AKP voted in the elections last year, 68.3 per cent would vote for the AKP in the next elections.
Nevertheless, these figures have been different, and some participants have warned that they could not want to say the DTP supporters.

The first constitution of Kosovo took effect on Sunday (June 15th) after Serbia declared independence.
The constitution recognises a sovereignty of Kosovo as a sovereignty and unilateral democracy.
The document says that Kosovo will not recognise any country or part of the territorial claims, and no country will not want to unite.
"Today, the constitution shows that it is completely completely completed by the state," President Fatmir Sejdiu said at a ceremony in Pristina on Sunday. "The Constitution is a long way for the road."

"We have been debate in the last ten years since these reforms are not controversial," Greek and Foreign Affairs Director Thanos Dokos told SETimes.
Many bloggers, such as Athens University professor Yanis Vouis, are unable to see the current strategy of Greece.
"So far, people have been aware that the Greek government has achieved an increase of 9% -- even though it has failed to reduce its overall optimism -- the loans of rescue loans have not been able to reduce the loans," he said.
Even though a 24-billion-euro loan package and debt, the country will not stop its debt rating, and the national revenue will not stop.
Thanasis Sokokos criticised the Greek Cypriots "the division of the world" and criticised the external democracy ", as well as" the external "of the people 'democracy', as well as to Zora.
"The main reason is that the people and their churches should not be done," he said.
Skokos argues that the disputes in the Greeks have been restricted and that any solution would be imposed to the new elections.
"We cannot be able to rescue the possibility of rescue by Greeks," he said.
Another bloggers say Greece has returned to a political scenario and a consequence.
Some are responsible for political perspective, and they are described as the systems that protect their own interests and their own interests.
"Although former Prime Minister George Papandreou is not part of the country, PASOK continues to support the traffic.
Finance Minister Evangelos Venizizelos, who has joined the Embassy and consumption taxes, is not a country that will help him, but he wants the prime minister. "

This agreement will not turn Turkey into a nuclear technology centre, such as the government proposed, and we will help Russia more. "
More than 65% of Turkish gas revenues from Turkey, while opponents say Moscow could use its role as an energy supply.
According to the EMO, electricity from the planned nuclear power plant will be crucial to the global market.
"We will have to pay approximately 51 billion euros for the 415 billion cubic metres of power over the past 15 years," the organisation said.
Meanwhile, the Great Renewal said the government did not see the opposition from the local citizens, actors and NGOs. "This is a multiethnic process," the Group said.

Progress organisation: Bulgaria sparks rise in corruption
Bulgaria is the largest country among the EU and Western European countries, according to Transparency International.
(International Transparency Organisation, Euobserver, Sofia Echo, Dnevnik, Mediapool, AFP, Bloomberg, Reuters, AP - 23 / 09 / 08)
Bulgaria ranked 3.6 points at the Anti-Corruption Index. [TI]
Bulgaria is not the most likely member of the 27-nation bloc, the International Corruption Organisation (TI) said in a report on Tuesday (September 23rd), adding that Bulgaria has not been in line with corruption.
In Berlin, the Centre for Anti-Corruption Index (CPI) showed that EU membership is not in Bulgaria as a major drop in its scores of points.
Bulgaria, Bulgaria, the EU and the Western Balkan countries were the last year, with only 3.6 points from 3.6 points to 3.8 points last year. Bulgaria, which ranked 1804, ranked 8th in the global survey of last year, ranked 72 in the survey of last year, respectively.
"Despite EU membership, the country is still under way to tackle the political fight against organised crime," TI said. "In the past two years, a judicial system in corruption and strategic theory agreements have been used in corruption, corruption and the development of a judiciary in the country, which has been used in the development of the EU funds, the country" has prompted the country &apos
About two years after joining the EU in January 2007, Bulgaria and Romania continue to be closed by Brussels for progress in the fight against judicial reforms and corruption.
The European Commission (EC) voiced concern that Sofia has achieved its success in the fight against organised crime in the country.
Under EU funds, the EC removed about 500m euros in aid to the Balkan country in July.
Bulgaria and Romania are aware of everything, and the EC will take action in the next monitoring report on the two countries, the Commission spokesman Mark Gray said at a press conference Tuesday.

The country is part of the EU and the remaining EU member states, as well as Turkey (58th), which has completed its accession talks with Brussels, and Croatia (62nd).
Moreover, New Zealand and Sweden are the highest score of 9.3 points in the world -- at least in corruption in the world.
Around 1.0 points are Somalia, which has been high-ranking for two years.
The new CPI has shown that Bulgaria is now a country that is not a country of corruption, but also a high level of corruption.
"Bulgaria, which is a member of the EU, cannot be acceptable to its neighbours in the EU," he told reporters on Tuesday, calling for a new strategy for corruption and opposing such practices.
Earlier in early August, the cabinet adopted a 200-page action plan for more than two weeks ago to prevent special measures, which would lead to suspension of EU aid and lack of interest.

The UN General Assembly endorsed on Thursday (September 9th) that it was supported by Serbia and 27 EU member states and called for direct talks between Belgrade and Pristina.
The initiative came after Serbia agreed to change the bill, demanding that Kosovo will start negotiations on status.
The new data is calling for EU support for improving co-operation.
The decision was unacceptable to the 192-nation parliament.
"The dialogue process is to contribute to peace, security and stability in the region, and to improve co-operation in the framework of this dialogue is aimed at improving the European Union and improving living standards," the decision said.
The decision to accept a mediator role in the EU in Kosovo talks is also recognised by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) before Kosovo declared independence in July 2008, without no international law.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, who is pushing, expressed that this is "not a document on the basic status issue".
Jeremic emphasised that Serbia is not recognised by Kosovo.
The Serbian delegation came hundreds of hours after President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and Foreign Minister Ivica Hyseni attended the session of the Kosovo delegation.
Following the controversial debate, Parliament Speaker decided to continue the meeting with Kosovo representatives.
Jeremic told the Serbian media that the stalemate was resolved as a result of "the representatives of the United States, Germany, Britain, Britain and France" that the Kosovo Albanians do not have an invitation.
Despite the amendments to the parliamentary session, the new decision in Pristina was positive.
The government said the decision "is completely completely completely with Kosovo and the region".
"This decision is a clear statement by the ICJ, which has made it clear that the independence of Kosovo is complete with international law.
In addition, the new draft is closely closed to any negotiations on the political status of Kosovo, "he said.
Kosovo leaders have voiced readiness to co-operate with Serbia as an independent state, as part of the state and Euro-Atlantic perspective on bilateral interests.
They also stressed, however, that sovereignty, territorial integrity and local constitutional issues will not be met.
Speaking ahead of the parliamentary session, Thaci said Kosovo and Serbia are facing joint problems, and that it should establish a constructive co-operation on regional issues such as energy, telecommunications, telecommunications, organised crime, education and persons.
US Vice-President Rosemal DiCarlo said the EU proposal to support the entities to join a constructive dialogue in Washington.
"It is time to open a new pace in relations with Serbia and Kosovo, with progress in the region and on their common future in the EU," DiCarlo said.

The Kosovo Reconstruction Commission has been investigating whether high interest rates in the country have not been restricted without an international agreement.

In Kosovo since 1999, nine banks operate in nine banks and the high credit rates affect the economic development of the country.
At that time, the Kosovo Reconstruction Commission (KRK) started investigating a bilateral agreement with the banks' interest rates, or no control.
"Kosovo banks have been investigated with suspect of detention agreements.
"The penalties for the Reconstruction can be able to produce 10% of the annual salaries," he said.
The Raiffeisen Bank and Project Bank, which is the logistics of the bankruptcy system, envisions higher interest rates in Kosovo.
"The interest rates of banks in the country are very similar to each other, as well as higher rates in the region," he said.
The Pristina Institute for Reconstruction (GEP) is a three-year study on the Kosovo bankruptcy Institute for Research (GEP), presented by the most popular loans on the Kosovo banking system and the banks' most popular loans -- commercial, commercial, agriculture, agriculture and poetry.
Experts argue that many businesses are based on credit loan, but the high interest rates are not created for developing the business climate.
"The amendments between 2011 and 2011 have changed between 9% and 24%.
"The loan of biometric loans or consumption loans have lower interest rates of commercial and agriculture loans, which have created a total of 70% of the total loans in Kosovo over the past three years," he said.
Bosnia and Herzegovina Puka argues that low interest rates will improve the economic development and financial stability of Kosovo.
"There is a positive impact on the loan of loan, and this is developing the economy with investment and consumption of consumption," he said.
"It is not a unique partner between the banks, which will be able to agree on widespread inflation.
Instead, the banks are smaller, and there is no model for competitiveness with others.
"This status is that we have two or three other optimistic monopolies in the country, and the market leader is being taken by the bank," he said.
While the government wants to change the banking system, he added, steps must be taken to strengthen financial stability.
"The ratification of the legal laws will allow the adoption of a first step in this direction.
In the second time, I can say that the courts are a precondition for reducing the risk of debt.
Since then, the consensus system of hydropower will allow the loan to increase the loan of loan, which would help increase the interest rates, "he said.
According to the Bank Watch report, the fiscal crisis in Kosovo has been more than loan last year, but it has also made some damage.
"The global financial crisis affects the quality of the Kosovo economy and bank loans.
Therefore, the total loans have 5.9% of the total loans, while this was 4.4% in 2009, respectively.
The bank seems to risk growth in western loans, and this has caused the rise of interest rates in early 2011, "he said.

Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said that the EU accession treaty is unable to reach this draft, while Croatia has achieved its strategic and historic goal.
However, there is a lot of jobs and they need to do so, not only for the EU.
"We think that we have a lot of challenges that Croatia is limited to the life of other member states.
The delay of Croatia is delay, and it was very difficult to do so, "he said.
"Croatia needs to be more active than reforms.
"It is the only way to build unnecessary sanctions in Bulgaria."
Tonino Picula, a SDP MP, told SETimes that Tusek 'visit to local media organisations is very serious.
"I think that we have a situation in this case, but I hope that the public will be very difficult and I hope that it is not in the EU, not only for the government," Picula said.
Even though the country has slowed support for the accession, most Croats supported it.
"I expect Croatia to end its EU negotiating chapter.
"I want my children to see the opportunity for education abroad, and I want to see their lives in the EU.
"The EU should be this," he said.

About ten days later, the government announced a new package of measures aimed at meeting the EU and the IMF last year, as well as to provide significant financing.
In addition, Greek authorities hope that they will assist 2 billion euros in aid to close the budget deficit this year.
Although the IMF does not affect this idea to resolve the open problem, it must focus on tax evasion.
"We should not implement a tax on a limited tax," IMF representative to Greece Boga Trava said in Athens on Monday. "This is not a sustainable political sustainable."

He discovered the current climate in the 1990s with the previous environmental environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Ceric [comments] have not been approved by representatives of the Serbian government.
Bosniak MP Meho Otovic, a member of the ruling coalition, said Ceric 'remarks are "unstable and dangerous" and would not benefit Bosniaks in Sandzak.
"Instead of reconciliation, it is a true for new divisions," he said.
According to Dusan Janjic, head of the Committee for Eastern Relations, the controversial debate is not aware.
"These remarks are seeking to remove the issue of Industry," Janjic said. "If Serbia is a candidate for membership and start negotiations with the EU, Serbia could be a historic date, if it is a starting date to start negotiations with the EU."
Meanwhile, Simic is believed to be completely unfair.
However, Simic said Sandzak has been living in social tensions, which has caused.
"In Sandzak, there is a very difficult social situation in Serbia in other parts of Serbia, but it is being used for multiethnic ethnic discrimination," Simic told SETimes.
Following Sandzak, thousands of Albanians who live in southeastern Serbia organised a protest in Bujanovac on September 13th, citing disputes in the education system for minorities.
The Albanian representative in the Serbian parliament said the aim is "political" and that the aim is to show the problems of education "due to the lack of textbooks in Albania".
Following this incident, the Serbian government said it would work to step up efforts to resolve the problem.

Following War Crimes in Serbia
[AFP] Zoran Djindjic has made the assassination of corruption and crisis activities, despite the end of Slobodan Milosevic.
The Belgrade police, who tried to leave the problem, said more than 7.500 people have been questioned for the need for reforms.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 12 / 05 / 03
Those who have donated and censorship groups have been able to meet their latest tasks to former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic, who have not been unprecedented types of female in this year.
They are discovered on 8 April in Belgrade.
Stambolic, a policy adviser to Slobodan Milosevic, was discovered in one of the largest money in Belgrade in 2000.
"In the past 1,000 days, we have shown a reality of us. He was killed by a government and a head of state.
All these were evidence of a prominent death in 16 years ago, "he said.
Stambolic 'nomination was established in a mountain near Novi Sad in March.
The suspects, known as the Year Berets, are estimated by some of the former police unit and the Zemun group, are estimated by Milosevic and his wife Mirjana Markovic.
Markovic is surprised by Marko Milosevic, who has been charged with Russia for the list of the Interpol as soon as possible.
The Serbian Interior Ministry has questioned that 7.73 people have been questioned since the police operation called "Kilic" was declared by the police operation, and was detained by 2.02 people.
Among the suspects are expected to build a smaller special army: 13 pieces of smaller army: 256 pieces, 346 square, 336 hectares, 336 hectares, 380 hectares, 380 hectares and 180-hour attacks were prepared to sell.

According to the DP, all those who are preparing to contribute to the assassination of Djindjic, Kostunica described the police unit as unanimous.
The Serbian government and the DSS are unfair that these protests are defined in the worst details of the Milosevic regime, and that they should face more consequences.
The DOS and DSS continued to remove Zivkovic 'insufficient management. The DSS has been charged with a criminal group against organised crime, accusing the fight against organised crime, accusing the current political hospital.
Zivkovic was also the main disputes between the prime minister and the National Bank of Serbia, after he declared an unacceptable board.

The government announced a statement on the decision to close the Nacan newspaper.
At the beginning, the government plans to establish a committee to evaluate their contributions to the media 'climate, but then criticised the idea.
Opposition polls say politicians still have a significant support of public support, while organised crime and the political climate must focus on issues that are not more hospitals.
Serbia is facing significant problems with political consequences.
A new president has not yet been completed, and there are no lack of changes in the scandals and the scandals.
All those indicates that Serbia should continue to resolve the problems in the coming months.
The murder of Djindjic is clear that this society and local policy is simply convinced.
However, the movement of water response to a result and accelerated reforms, and the impact of the tragedy.

Agriculture and Document Support
Albanian Deputy Economy Minister Ilir Ciko was held on 11 September at the World Trade Organisation in Canada.
Talks focused on agriculture subsidies and EU investments in the effort to assessed issues on agricultural and competitiveness. [AFP] The Chamber of Commerce in Southeast Europe is crucial for the improvements of nine agriculture countries.
Former Romanian Finance Minister and economist Daniel Daianu suggests the situation in the wake.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 22 / 09 / 03
At the end of the world, the most popular Iraq and the Middle East has been defined.
Many governments are the agenda of the agenda, geopolitical issues and terrorist attacks.
However, the economic situation in many parts of the world has been sparked, and the United States is facing problems such as the Chairman Safet Hurriyet Hurriyet Hasani, high unemployment figures, high or high unemployment disputes, poverty disputes, poverty disputes, poverty, but the second motion of terrorism.
The United States' advisory of the world economy is concerned, however, that some countries will show positive signatures. But the economic stalemate in Western Europe is a negative effect of this optimism.
The situation in countries, social, economic and policies are also facing further conditions.
The major part of Africa and the Latin Asia are also being focused on economic problems in some areas of institutional structures, social discrimination, ethnic discrimination and violence.
The state and government governments, which have been consequenced, are a symbolic of concern.
These amendments are an important donation for the meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Canada.
While the DOHA Chamber of Commerce initiated, many environmental resources have met not only in accordance with the improvement of protection, but also in order to ensure the current presence in the world trade.
The free trade controversial agenda is expected to focus on the value of the world trade consortium in the DOHA Chamber of Commerce: agriculture products, developing countries' competitiveness and serious restrictions on agriculture markets, and a negative effect on agriculture products.
For many countries, agriculture products are the main exploration of agriculture products.
In other countries, the general spending of public spending is being spending.
The United States and the EU have provided some 280 billion euros in the agriculture fields of agriculture, but some 50 billion euros in developing development are about 50 billion euros.
The high primary prices in the countries are being implemented, and their own products have sparked unfair competition against farmers.
No serious obstacles for the implementation of the countries' basic demands should not be taken.
Thousands of farmers in the rich countries can face the implementation of reforms.
At the time, the state has also been seeking security concerns, as it is trying to increase the threats of inadequate policy and to prevent external independence from foreign resources.
The current arrangements are difficult to tackle the greatest punishment of villages in poor countries to punish their efforts.
The World Bank emphasises that this negative situation for years, while the United States and EU high-level officials are aware of the reality, national interests are facing a stable reform process.
A deal with the United States and the EU on trade of agriculture products is expected to be discussed in Canada.
Analysts, however, do not have any concrete figures on the tax and procurement rates or concrete restrictions.
This agreement, which is a very important goal, is to give it a lot of intelligence.
Regional products (especially in trade) can affect the progress of trade products (especially in the trade zone), which would affect trade rules in Canada.
The EU is widely committed to joint talks on investment institutions, competitiveness and other trade arrangements.
The rules, called "Sandzak", are important, but the controversial controversial controversy is not seen as a critical factor.
If the main reforms are not implemented, trade rules can not contribute to economic development in poor countries.
So far, commercial issues are widespread to more than Document agenda, while the meeting in Canada should be weakened.
The agriculture sector in Southeast Europe is widely high.
In addition, the GDP is up to 8 per cent of GDP.
Albania, for example, is approximately 50 per cent.
The large part of the census is not in disappointment, as well as low and public budget support.
The situation in Southeast Europe has not yet been made in terms of technology / technology and has not been achieved in a developing development in the EU markets, but the population has not tried to leave the situation.
With the high unemployment rate in the region, this problem could be more pressure on local economies, which could help social disputes.
The demands for agriculture products to the EU are more easy, and the demands for the reform of the Orthodox Agriculture Policy (CAP) are also a strong need for European integration, as well as the high primary reasons for social and social interest rates.
Among these countries, the subsidies will provide a security mechanism in public budget. Poland and and Hungary, which are expected to join the EU in 2004, are facing this problem.
For Romania and Bulgaria, the situation in the Western Balkans is more serious, and the situation in the Western Balkans will be more serious: the EU wants to reduce accession and agriculture subsidies.
The Orthodox Agriculture Policy, considered one of the key problems in the world trade, could cause uncertain policy in countries in the EU accession process.
Most of these countries are not enough for competitiveness, but the economy is not enough.
If there is no need to create intelligence workers, the effective social security measures are not created and that the police movement for abroad could not be restricted in a number of restrictions.
However, the countries in the EU should be widely important for the development of the trade process, as well as the development of poor countries.
The Balkan countries, which have been seen as an integrated division of EU membership, can provide more safe protection and facilitate the export of agriculture products, if the trade process is successfully successful.
For the time, the leaders of the developed countries have to show their visitors to the state businessman, ensuring the interest of the poor countries in the world, and to establish policies in line with the problems of the poorest countries.

EU offer new political agreement to Serbia
EU foreign ministers, who did not reach an agreement on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, have offered an interim agreement.
(AFP, FT, The Guardian, Euobserver, Blic - 29 / 01 / 08; Reuters, AP, DPA, BBC, AKI, International Herald Tribune, Balkan Insight, Beta, B92, EU - 28 / 01 / 08)

EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday (January 28th) to offer an interim political agreement aimed at improving trade and education in Serbia and facilitating visa requirements for Serbian passengers.
"We accepted a very very tension that is the way to open Serbia into the EU," Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said after a meeting in Brussels.
Most of the ministers attended the meeting with the EU in November to reduce the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
However, a decision by the Netherlands insisted that the EU must fulfil its requirements for full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The Hague tribunal still wants to arrest and hand over four remaining war crimes suspects, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military commander Ratko Mladic.
Since then, EU foreign ministers agreed on a new proposal that Serbia will be submitted and Rupel described as the first step towards eventual membership in the bloc.
According to EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, Serbia must see its new proposal as a "very strong message" that the bloc is an important part of Europe and that it is a clear message to join the Union.
The EU is planning to sign a new framework agreement on February 7th, after the presidential elections in Serbia.
Brussels hopes that this date will increase the chance of pro-European President Boris Tadic, a pro-European mandate.
The EU feels that a victory of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party would return to the country and prepare for regional stability.
Nikolic is head of the party, Vojislav Seselj, who was arrested in The Hague.
Some EU officials have voiced hope that the SAA would be able to sign a new agreement if Nikolic won.
"If Nikolic won the victory in Brussels, there is more different," the AFP quoted Spanish Minister for European Affairs Alberto Navararia as telling reporters at a meeting in Brussels.
"There is a lot of losses in Serbia," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. "The Serbian citizens are doing between a nationalist past and a European future.
I am confident that the Serbian people will elect the European future and will be really unrealistic. "

The two Southeast European countries, Romania and Bulgaria, are expected to join the European Union on 1 January 2007.
Another candidate, Croatia, is on the agenda of the accession process.
Some EU members, meanwhile, are concerned about the EU enlargement process, while the Balkan countries continue to move forward.
"I think that the candidate countries will be able to move forward at the same time, the responsibility for the governments in the region to establish economic, institutional and political arrangements to the EU.
I am confident that the participation is in terms of economic policy.
At the same time, "a functioning market economy" and the EU should be able to find a economy that will cause a competitive environmental environmental environmental environment.
In order to enter the European club, the traditional policies need to seek a rules.
For example, the free movement of free movement (free movement) in the EU is a challenge to liberalise, while we are considered a danger.
Meanwhile, new members will remain in the situation, including the eurozone.
A competitive economy, which is not competitive, will be very difficult in this market, which is used to use joint money.
Among countries in the EU, the financial sector, a independent bank, the property rights of property rights, should be important, such as the institutional and mechanisms, such as a private sector that can be protected and implementation of the judiciary.
The capacity of fighting corruption and organised crime is one of the key conditions.
Economic stability is essential.
For that time, inflation has been working in a decisive level of inflation, the budget deficit must be defined at low levels and control of the budget.
The path of economic stability is due to a broadcast in both public sector and private sector restrictions.
The huge budget deficit is increasingly increasing pressure on the pension system.
Public organisations are one of the key issues of concern.
These companies are not a major job for privatisation.
There will be a better way for some public companies, and such organisations should be improved as a solution.
The distributors should be able to hold a good arrangement, and that citizens should not have to pay high prices for services.
Economic stability is one of the major problems facing many candidates. [EU]
However, we need some warnings that are convinced, we need to deal with the observers.
In addition, the economic policy needs to establish commercial exchange.
The lowest inflation rate of 2 per cent is very difficult for the economies that the EU average is at 5-10 per cent, due to the revenue of the purchase money.
The greatest economies are in the interest of pressure, inflation.
The prices of local services are increasingly increasingly increasing.
The Balkan economies have increased by 5 per cent in recent years, such as the Middle East and Eastern European countries.
However, this growth is a more efficient, and a more stable human resources need to invest.
So far, the low budget deficits could be removed from two seats.
The second figure could not see the reality of the public services, such as low figures, infrastructure, education and health services, and a serious problem in the region 'economies.
First, new members will have to increase public spending in the framework of the facility with the EU after their accession.
Therefore, the possibility of the budget deficit is possible.
The ruling parties could block a general economic stability if they have made progress on tax taxes, and if the pension system (pension) does not take place in the state, the budget deficit could not be made.
Together, the economy is not the same situation, with the current account deficits and budget deficits.
The economic growth in Eastern and Eastern European economies have been increasingly higher than EU member states, and the bank is increasingly increasingly increasing credit loans in the private sector.
In the framework of the monetary liberalisation, the current account deficit accounts for direct investments are also under serious risks.
The boycott of the data is that the governments who are trying to establish a budget policy.
The IMF is the reason for the budget deficit of Bulgaria, which is expected to expect the current account deficit in the past 12 per cent of GDP, and the establishment of the money is not allowed to establish a foreign currency.
We have returned to competitiveness.
Regional economies could be a serious rise in the region, or a rise in external structures, because the high inflation of high inflation is likely to be reduced.
Such competitiveness and employment are negative.
This will also be much better in the economies, such as Western Balkan countries, such as unemployment.
Czech and other Asian countries are not a solution to the European markets of imports.
The restructuring of the monetary union ended the period of increasing competitiveness in Europe.
To protect competitiveness in the long term, the new development of scientific and communications technologies must be made to serious investments in human resources.
Some of them are a key topic, and some significant benefits, but the problems could be able to cope with the problem.
Most of citizens who live in the residents can stay in their homes, with a 250-40 per cent stake in trade deficits (Romania) and Bulgaria.
In other news, however, the crowd has been discovered by immigrants, and many of the families are disappointed.
In this context, the unemployment rate in Western Balkan countries is high, and it is possible to say that the worker exports are a clear factor.
As a result, the governments in the Western Balkan countries should be able to see the reality of economic demonstrations in the past years, pragmatic, pragmatic and benefit from the EU and the new members of the new members.

Nevertheless, polls say, the population is not satisfied with the truth of the population, and that one of the two people believe that this is a lot of government.
Nevertheless, the ruling party won only two per cent or two per cent support.
The opposition PASOK party seems to see a political case.
The party was charged with more than ten years ago by the ND in March 2004, and accused the country of using weak environmental protection laws.
Public health services and other parties have caused concerns about what they can benefit from the current parliament for the first time.
They include small parties.
As the question, the two main parties say they are unacceptable, while 11% say they are unacceptable.
"This is the increase of the popular parties," the British daily Independent reported on Tuesday (September 4th), adding that "small-party analyst Dimitris Micropoulos' '' '' '.
"This is a result of the state should not be able to avoid details, then then the situation is unable to resolve the situation," he said.
Among the public, the two main parties are calling for public votes and bloggers to give their votes from the bloc.
The amendments also noted that the infrastructure of the Greek public is not only the current government because it is not a war crimes.
Most of the people believe this is the success of the government.
This means that five political parties can be able to elect parliament.
Greece could also have a weakness government, which has a smaller political forces.

The question is the most serious issues about the problem and citizens.
The North Cyprus Republic of Northern Cyprus has demanded "reconciliation" to protect the rights of Turkish Cypriots.
Following violence in 1960, the majority of Turkish Cypriots had to live in their homes.
Therefore, there are no strong universities under the Greek Cypriot control.
The only sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus was one of the main positions of the Greek Cypriots.
The latest effort to reunify Cyprus was adopted by the Turkish Cypriots in 2004, the Annan Plan, which was rejected by the Greek Cypriots, was rejected by a "single international sovereign sovereignty", but also allowed the Turkish state to be recognised by Turkish Cypriots.
The agreement on a sovereign sovereign sovereignty was not announced on Tuesday.
Analysts say the UN is "constructive" on sovereignty of sovereignty and citizens ".
On Tuesday, the deal was a change for Turkish Cypriots, but Talat has forced Talat to accept the reunification of a successful round of negotiations.
So far, the Greek Cypriot government has been slowly slow and insisted that the process of negotiations should be prepared before the start of negotiations.
Turkish nationalists charged Talat on Tuesday that the Turkish Cypriots' historic case would mean a "unilateral sovereign sovereign sovereignty".
The ruling Democratic Party, however, acknowledged that the Greek Cypriots do not see a real interest in the start of negotiations.
Chancellor has been pressure on his own circumstances.
Although Greek Cypriots have frozen to northern Cyprus over the past few years, Christian Christofias said he was ready to accept 50,000 Turkish immigrants.
Turkish Cypriot Parliament Speaker Fatmir Sejdiu described the meeting Tuesday as a good step.
"The details of social and citizens will be made when the negotiations are start," he said.
The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the EU in 2004, but the island does not benefit from the northern part of the island because the EU does not recognise the divided Turkish Cypriot state.
Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot leaders will meet on July 25th.

In a recent press conference, Bulgarian Authority Director Nikolai Popov announced some details about tax trafficking.
A series of control of 62 textbooks in April showed that only 14 per cent of the country 'most popular citizens have been on the right to tax officials.
As a result, expenditures are about 3m euros to Bulgaria, or a tax on smuggling of 30,000 euros.
Earlier three years ago, authorities launched two similar operations, "the Special Operation operation".
He also met the real challenges that were discovered.
Authorities are aiming to raise all the values of more than 50,000 euros from all separate schools.
More than 200,000 Bulgarian citizens were selected for instance, but the budget restricted to 200.
According to Popov, the investigations have been faced with medical exchange and tax evasion.
Another 1500 square metres of gasoline, one of the most frequently in Sofia, said a family had no way to come.
Another however, the owner of a couple was unveiled in a letter to refugee tensions.
Meanwhile, medical scientists have registered Germany or Austria to pay taxes from their owners.
The victory of Popov, Valentin Vidolov, told reporters that ten tax evasion operations have been working on the Slivessels operation and that more than 1,000 hectares and more than 1,000 hectares of hotels.
Most of them are businessmen and state officers.
Furthermore, they are planning to promote separate schools in other countries, in co-operation with the National Intelligence Agency, after which they "insist that the secret rules".
This is still a long way.
Special operations, transparency and independent control are not independent.
One of the reasons of this poverty could be corruption officials. In a recent survey of 699 employees who worked in all of the 28th tax service, participants said they have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly smaller circumstances.
The results suggest the current scandal of public officers that they are unable to fight corruption.
Despite such approval, the authorities are widespread to pressure on the fiscal inspectors and to accept the money or accept it.
Some officials have no other risk of the "Special Operation", if they are submitted to the cases in the coming months.

The Macedonian Ministry of Agriculture has prepared a strategy for agriculture and food sectors as part of preparations for the country ’ s final membership.
The government says amendments to agriculture policies, institutions and mechanisms will be implemented by September.
"The technology is based on three basic principles: no investment in the agriculture sector, not under the current conditions: to invest in the agricultural sector, to recognise the legal mechanisms model, and to discuss the EU integration talks with the EU."
"This document is very important because we have shown that we have shown about 60 per cent of the reforms in the agriculture sector," Petrov said.
According to officials, the total transition process in Macedonia has caused negative results on the agriculture sector.
The project aims to improve the situation in the Macedonian agriculture sector, which would increase competitiveness, boost competitiveness, increase competitiveness and allow the state to provide more funding in the agriculture sector.
The project also suggests that some of the scenarios have been implemented.
"We need to provide an installed agriculture products and improve production and environmental protection of environmental protection," Petrov said.
Macedonia must implement a major consensus to prepare a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, as part of its border crossings and removing customs obstacles.
The government warns that such changes will be more competitive as a result of Macedonian products.
"Although the EU has been recognised as long as reforms, the agriculture sector will have a more efficient and effective change," Petrov said. "This could have the right to exchange the Orthodox Agriculture Policy, which has a total of 43m euros in the agriculture sector, with a total of 50 per cent of the total EU budget."

Despite the lack of political relations between Athens and Skopje, citizens who live in the north of Greece are seeking a border cross-border facility, as well as other services and services.
Although the two Balkan neighbours are "disputed due to" Macedonia ", this is not a obstacle to the economy.
According to Greek journalists, Bitola, Gevevija or Strumica "has dropped up to 50% due to" medics ".
It is a major factor against the impact of the economic crisis.
"We are not in this issue.
Several people are also in terms of cheaper or innovation.
A customs officer told SETimes that 1,000 Greek citizens are at the average level of Evonia border crossings last week, while the number of votes were participated in this week.
"It is in the city of Gevorija," Memal said, referring to a unit of many people in the north.
The average average of 500,000 Greek citizens have been closed to two border crossings, he added.
Giorgos Xanopoulos, head of the Florina foreigners' columnist, is on the ground for 27 years.
Xanthopoulos said the incident began since 2000, when local residents started to Bitola.
"The economic crisis in Greece, and in particular, people are able to concrete consortium for low prices," Xanopoulos told SETimes.
Many citizens who live in Florina say that the health fundamental funds, including the State Energy Affairs.
However, the balance has been able to provide prices in 1994.
Xanthopoulos said the state funding is about 50m euros, but only 7m euros.
In Bitola, the same job is about 15 euros.
At the same time, a protocol is about 1,000 euros in the Florina and Kokis, while in Bitola, it could be lower than 300,000 euros.
Some 150 euros have been registered by an unprecautionary service, but a Greek textbook is estimated by 20 euros.
Xanthopoulos said that the number of tourists who are not part of this insurance is "unknown" among the Florinians, who are not part of the insurance.
Foreign doctors are not willing to seek restaurants or other intelligence cases that will ratify local funds.
Karams Jakovidis, head of the principles' association, also reiterated the assessment of his colleague.
Jovidis said he has made an interview for three television stations, and acknowledged that the number of prices in other cities is unrealistic.
"People 'borders, as well as organised crime highlights," Jovidis told SETimes.
It is more than 50% or more. "
However, both sides insist that the facilities are better in Greece and that Greek bridges are more stable.
"There is no idea of preparations, but there is no need for this country in neighbouring the neighbouring country, which does not have to meet the EU rules and rules," Xanthopoulos said.
However, Xanthopoulos acknowledged that the general life in Bitola is lower than Florina.
"Therefore, this is a reason for organised crime, because there is a number of people who live in the Bitola region."
Aleksandar Ivanovski, owner of the Edyptian Church in Bitola, told SETimes that the Greeks' visitors are a major part of the work of their visitors ", and that visitors' visitors' services' '' '' '&apos

Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Sunday (March 8th) that the Serbian government expects the long-standing discrimination law to be passed by the end of April.
The law enforcement is one of the requirements for Serbia to join the Schengen summer list, which would allow Serbian citizens to travel to EU member states.
According to the Blic daily, the ruling European party is preparing to adopt a bill to support the "significant changes" in the parliamentary group for Serbia, the daily Blic reported on March 10th.
However, the government will not be sent to parliament without controversial provisions by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 10 March, the newspaper said.
The government adopted the bill last month, but the "traditional" Orthodox ", Roman, Roman Catholic, Muslim, Egyptian, Egyptian and other minorities oppose a law on the freedom of movement of genocide.
At that time, the government has dismissed the bill on parliament.
NGOs described the law as an ancient democratic.
"I hope that every law will have to question different churches," said Labour and Social Policy Minister Rasim Ljajic.
Ljajic said the bill did not provide information about the government television conference, which was decided to remove parliament on the agenda.
According to the study and social policy ministry, the largest discrimination groups in Serbia have been created, while equal women and obstacles are affected.
Recent discrimination against Roma is the worst because the population has no identity documents.
Greeks are willing to advance education rights and they do not have access to health insurance or aid.
The bill does not recognise special and general discrimination cases, and the establishment of a representative to protect the equality of equality, if citizens can be discriminated.
This representative will initiate legal transformation on judges or judges.
Since the economic crisis, representatives will not start until early 2010.
Since then, citizens can start legal structure if the law is implemented.
The law envisions discrimination of nationalism, the elderly and lives, as well as human differences.
The penalty penalties will be changed between 53 and 1.56 euros, which will replace the perpetrators' reputation.
Serbia is still the only country in Europe, which is still a gender law.

The international community should not meet the closure of the High Representative (OHR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the International Crisis Group (ICG) said on Monday (March 9th).

It said the PIC should try to "meet all conditions for the BiH Special Representative (EUHR) to fulfil all requirements for transition," the organisation said.
The new high representative (Bonn) should represent its authority, but only a few cases should not use serious threats to the Dayton Accords and to prevent them.
The ICG emphasised that BiH must be fully fulfilled by Dayton agreements, resolving the status of Brcko and the problem of public goods.
Therefore, a decision to cover the OHR would "take the risk of the EU" to protect social policies for Bosnia and Herzegovina, "the study warned.
"As the OHR closed, we will need a strong EU mission to encourage the stability of both Bosnia and Herzegovina and to encourage membership," the ICG said.
Furthermore, the EU will need to improve the three main ethnic groups in the country, which is still under way.
"The EU should be an active factor against the unilateral discrimination of the Dayton Accord and now the special authority of the Special Representative must focus on financial support," the report said.
The EU mission, which will replace the OHR, must operate under a high-ranking official that will serve as EUFOR and the European Commission mission in BiH.
The EU will ask BiH to ensure its Dayton Accords, and the EU must reach a deal on a number of actions that would reflect "from any entities", the report said.
The ICG also recommended that EUFOR would report a report on UN Security Council and other sides.
The organisation also proposed that the EU will co-operate with EUFOR to boost NATO &aposs presence in the FBiH.

Last month, the first World Investment factory in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) since the 1990s conflict is not the result of this part of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), but also points to a change in the former industrial donation, as well as a lot of jobs in the region, which has been recognised by the massacre of war.
The Swedish company Sweden has invested 500,000 euros in the Bos Agro Food factory, which will replace local farmers.
In a seminar, thousands of Muslims are part of an unearthed factory in July 1995 by Bosnian Serb forces.
However, the summer, who is in the middle of all, is seen as a sign that it is a chance to achieve more transparency in the future.
"We have the right to better life," Srebrenica Mayor Abdullah Malic said. "This facility has opened the doors of agricultural products, especially in the quality of food."
The municipality, which is willing to invest in one of the poorest war zones in BiH, has prompted the factory, which will provide about 30 jobs.

How can you do this, and how do you do it better to improve what can they do so? "
The farmers who have helped Semun to start the talks are Muslims who have returned to the region.
Last year, the three municipalities in the region have returned to 3,000 Muslims, and these people are facing small farmers.
The targets are more people who want to return to this aim, said Special Director Ardic.
The company hopes it will encourage the first investments to move forward.
Authorities said a foreign currency producer is interested in neighbouring neighbouring, and Bosnian companies hope that it will open the factory in the region.
The head of the Office of the High Representative, the head of the economy, said that the business model would be functioning, and that efforts would "refrain".
"Currently, the Swiss investor has proved a market market (organisations) and emphasised the road to consumption," he said. "The economic situation is not changed.
The aim is a step, but it will create conditions for more successful achievements. "

In recent years, the construction of the Black Sea coastal Bulgarian coastal coastal has caused a lot of details, while many hotels stay at the summit.
The country is only one of the problems facing tourism, the German Deutsche Welle said in a report on Sunday (August 12th).
Marin Neskov, a Bulgarian tourist expert in the Black Sea, told the German media website that the need for infrastructure, despite the construction of hotels, barriers and other tourist facilities.
Meanwhile, Denmark Baghdad, a resort in the 35km north of Bourgas, has been expanded in Bulgaria 'market economy, and is now under more than 200 barriers, including many of them.
However, we have to deal with transport and communications.
Neskov says the water and mechanisms are insufficient.
According to Deutsche Welle, tourist amounts to 2m euros a year, while Bulgaria &aposs trade deficit is about half.
However, according to the head of the Bulgarian tourism agency, the number of foreign tourists from the country is decreased.
The revenue of international tourists from January to May 2006 was around 52m euros, the head of the State Tourism Agency (DOD), Angela Kyrkova, said on July 26th.
However, he said, the number of foreign tourists after years of concrete growth has dropped in the same five months.
The survey, which has been on the Black Sea coastal coast over the past decade, has caused competitiveness in uncertainty levels, he said.
While the number of foreign tourists was declined to decrease prices last month.
In particular, there are still many places in sea hotels.
According to Kruhkova, the construction centre, which has been built over 50 per cent of the hotels in the region, which has been removed in the past decades.
The lack of holding holidays could cause expenditures next year, the agency said.
The Bulgarian citizens have been increasingly increasingly increasing their holidays in neighbouring countries, while the mobile owners have recommended not only to attract more consumers to foreign tourists, but also to reduce prices for local tourists.
Public insufficient insufficiency is another problem of Bulgarian tourism.
Observers have been able to do so, but they are not willing to get a more precedent.
In addition, many students are abroad to work in the tourism sector.
"Tourism is the lowest salary in Bulgaria," Neskov told Deutsche Welle.

Macedonia took over the chairmanship of the Roma Privatisation Summer for 2015, a national programme aimed at improving Roma integration and prosperity.
The ten years, governments, international organisations and NGOs to boost their participation in the education, employment and health care, as well as to discuss other key issues such as discrimination.
"The rotating presidency of Macedonia will continue to ensure the training of Roma during the next 12 months," National Affairs co-ordinator Nedzim Mustafa told SETimes.
Since 2005, Mustafa said the Roma community has a positive achievements in Europe.
"In Macedonia, it is crucial to students and advisory advisers, as well as [especially] to provide employment through education," Co-operation said.
Mustafa said Macedonia will hold several international organisations and conference on developing Roma employment initiatives.
Mustafa said education continues to be the basic basis of the Roma community in Macedonia and other areas.
Roma, Romania, Romania, Hungary, Spain, Spain and Turkey are the largest minority in Europe.
The number of Roma in Macedonia is 53,000, or 2.6% of the total population, but they are recognised as a different ethnic community in the constitution.
The first Roma municipality of Europe and the Roma are the first time in the world.
Macedonia should be seen as an example of support in the world, including Romania 'problems -- Romania' bankruptcy, freedom and programmes.
"It was the first to find a recognition of the Roma songs", Rexhepi said. "It was published with the support of Skopje and his support," he said.
One of the problems facing Macedonia ’ s ten Youth presidency is that some citizens -- are demanding asylum seekers from the EU.
Following a clear recommendation that Brussels will be removed to asylum problems, the government has taken various jobs and social support for the EU 'implementation of asylum seekers.
The number of asylum applications for asylum seekers has been dropped from 400,000 this year, according to data released last month by the Belgian Ministry of Hospital and Thessaloniki.
However, Macedonian NGO sector spokesman Omanovski says that ten Youth have not made significant progress.
Otovski said that the absence is the action plan that the participants of more than ten years have shown.
"The problem is that more than ten years will be a national co-ordinator and implementation agency.
I have proposed that this process, because the co-ordinator [is] a Deputy Prime Minister, for example, a Deputy Prime Minister, for example, for example, as well as the Roma problems.
Most of the Romanian presidency, Osmanovski said, was not very happy because they did not know the basic targets and consequences of the last ten years, or not enough issues.
"The high level of education is still low, poverty and discrimination, and they are now seeking to play a successful role in initiatives to ensure that the NGO sector is now seeking to ensure that more than ten years ago," Otovski said.
Among them, the number of Roma students who have been discovered in universities and improved their model.
"The Macedonian government should continue to support these initiatives," he added.

EU foreign ministers urged Montenegro on Monday (January 22nd) to fight reforms and corruption in the judiciary.
He also criticised Montenegrin prosecutors in a period of criticising the courts' insufficient work and that they do not know the number of cases.
"The cases of delays in the courts have stopped because of the delay in the courts, while the decisions are refused to be taken," State Prosecutor Vesna Magica said in a report in 2005.
According to Magica, the cases are not linked to 46.6%.
"The number of cases of insufficient cases have shown insufficient insufficient insufficient interest in the courts, while the fight against organised crime is insufficient and the lack of legal security of citizens," Magica said in a report.
Opposition politicians have been charged with charges that judges in the country have been under control of the ruling structures, especially in the parliamentary majority.
Judiciary representatives acknowledge the situation.
The judges argue that the authority should be taken from parliament and be given to the new Council of Ministers.
Among other factors, the judiciary is not a separate budget, and the government has been a role in consensus on judges.
The European Commission (EC) said in its annual progress report in early November that corruption remains a broad problem in Montenegro.
"The legal and intelligence framework is the removal of insufficient activities, and the state is closing its ability to fight corruption," the commission said.
The EC welcomed the steps to improve Montenegrin judges' education, while emphasising the need for the process to attract politics.
The organisation said it should be based on "professional and unfair criteria", fulfilling political criteria.
Montenegrin Constitutional Court President Ranko Vukotic acknowledges the EC recommendations.
"The current constitution of Montenegro and the new constitution does not allow the judiciary to implement international standards in independence and autonomy," he said.
"I hope that the new constitution would be a obstacle to respect the judges of the best lawyers, and the best legal figure is the obstacle to participate and other winners," he added.

The Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for eight years ago, said the agreement is the key to the constitution and the constitution.
"The Dayton framework is not a framework," former US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told the press in Sarajevo on October 2nd. "There is no constitution in the world that has been improved in the past eight years -- many changes have changed, such as the state security services, such as the Office of the High Representative."
"The Dayton framework is a framework and it should not be able to change it.
Everyone accepted by all three groups is applied for us, "he said.
Holbrooke was speaking at the BiH Assembly, and former UNMIK chief Bernard Kouchner was speaking.
Both of them were encouraged to support the work of the High Representative and encourage the citizens to do more.
Holbrooke was transferred to Germany in 1994 to the embassy in BiH as one of the foreign ministers in Europe.
A US delegation, led by the end of the war, was the most responsible for the wartime parties to sign a peacekeeping agreement in the province of Ohio in November 1995. The agreement was designed to establish a government in the divided country.
Earlier this year, Holbrooke told parliament that his team in Dayton is not a compromise.
In example, the former ambassador noted that the central government should be allowed to be more efficient, more ethnic groups in BiH, to be allowed to exercise three army staff in BiH, and to establish a real and compromise compromise compromise in South Africa.
However, Holbrooke said he did not want to give the image of disappointed during his visit.
"We have made progress, very serious economic challenges, but this is the result of the new generation," the former ambassador said.

As a result of the EU accession process, the Turkish government hopes that a new ministerial board will replace the internal affairs.
The European Commission will now take over the co-ordination of Turkey &aposs progress in the EU integration process, which is currently a mandate by the state minister and chief negotiator, Eide Baghdad.
The government is a key goal: the EU is full with the EU by the end of 2013.
According to Prizren Sandzak, one of the top diplomats in Turkey, the ministry has sent a significant message to both external and abroad, adding that the country continues to be prepared for full membership in the European Union.
"This is proud that Turkish foreign policy has been convinced and transparent," he told SETimes.
The slowdown regional diplomacy and EU integration, as well as EU members Germany and France, have slowed their stance on Turkey 'accession to the West, as well as the observers have caused to protect Turkey from the West.
At the same time, however, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the ruling AKP -- now has to deal with a number of problems that could serve as a major factor in the EU accession process.
These include a new constitution and efforts to resolve the Kurdish problem.
The new ministry will be the same level with the State Department.
The EU Secretary-General Assistant Secretary of State (EUCS) has made a direct report to the prime minister, while the ministry will have full responsibility for the EU economy.
According to Sandzak, however, the new ministry could cause the implementation of the reform process, and this could lead to the centre of various ministries and doctors to fulfil its mandate.
"This ministry should be a certain and manner of the ministries of internal affairs, but it is difficult for political presence in the policy," he said.
Snezim Karaas, owner of the Kriarter department, is believed to have many obstacles on the process of membership.
"It is an important step to overcome the management of the competencies between institutions and institutions since the EUGS board was established in 2000," he told SETimes.
The responsibility for foreign relations should continue at the level of foreign relations, he said, adding that EU membership should be defined as a result of external and boycott.
Therefore, the State Department should be able to continue its job functioning, and the new ministry should not be able to enter a fair, such as the role of the responsibility of the Foreign Affairs, but it must work together with a very effective and effective co-operation.
Despite its role in the EU reform process in Turkey, the issue and the issue in the agenda is questionable to block Cyprus' new Fashies, some questionnaire issues, such as the government 'EU membership could be able to cope on the list of priorities.
"If the AKP won the June 12th election results, the new ministry will reduce this event, which will reduce relations with the EU."

A year ago: Albania visited around 3.5 million tourists last year with a 32% increase in previous years.
Authorities are awaiting to become more known.
"Our expectations are based on improvements in infrastructure and improving progress in the general tourism sector," Culture and Tourism Ministry head Enver Jori told SETimes.
"However, the political situation could be negative," he added.
He said the lack of infrastructure, including insufficient links to most popular documents, is one of the main problems the country is to turn its potential for tourism.
He added that the government wants to increase investments in the sector and is preparing a law on this direction.
Dritan Xavier, 35, is operating a tourist centre in Tirana for eight years.
The company has submitted everything to travel insurance from scientific and packages.
"Now this year is good," he said, acknowledging that the complex political climate in Albania could affect the number of visitors.
Nevertheless, it added, the sector "removed a positive change" in the exclusive level before the past few years.
Most Western tourists see students, cultural tourism and archaeology.
Most are from Britain, Italy, Finland and Denmark.
"Albania is doing them," he said.
Meanwhile, the number of visitors in Albania is increasing, while Albanians are abroad for their holidays.
He says Albania is still "more tourist tourists", where it was "imported".
Of these reasons, the number of services in Albania is low and wants to see other cultural heritage in Europe.
"You are willing to meet the quality of quality, which is more than abroad," he said.
In the past, Albanians are seeking to travel to countries, such as Turkey.
According to resources from the sector, however, visa liberalisation has changed the situation, and Croatia, Greece and Spain are increasingly increasing.
The Tirana Industry Industry says it would select the holidays in different countries, because new people are seeking to see different cultural heritage, and encourage tourists to visit history.
"This is also a reason for the residents who recognise our holidays, and in accordance with the quality of services and services," he told SETimes.

Political parties need to foster money. [Reuters]
The Serbian political parties have demanded that the EU has given its feelings that it is one of the largest corruption products, and demanded that the country 'political operations are being removed.
On Tuesday (June 14th), the Serbian parliament adopted a law on financing the financing of political parties and financing, which would allow them to improve their activities and benefit from other parties.
"The law envisions a clear penalties for those who do not comply with law," State Department President Milan Markovic said, adding that all parties will now be open to public opinion and will be made through the account of the bankruptcy.
The public will be financed by political parties abroad, and the parties will be able to receive money from private resources.
This means that the parties in Serbia will be punished for the first time in the parallel structures.
Chief of the Anti-Corruption Agency, Zorana Markovic, said the new mechanisms for political activities are necessary to believe that the public is very corruption in this area.
"I think that we can be satisfied because we have a good legal mechanism for transparency in this area.
"I believe that we can [see] the political parties' financing, and we believe that a more realistic measures can be taken," he said.
According to the new law, the illegal financing could be sentenced to three years in prison.
The same sentence will also be applied for those who have any dangerous threat to political parties.
Zlata Djordjevic, a member of the Anti-Corruption Committee, told SETimes that the new law is important that the political parties will allow the monetary documents to control the financial reports and exercise control.
"The control of the party activities could be very important in the fight against corruption in the political scene," Djordjevic said.
Djordjevic said the law would block the parties that have been formed to receive money for the general elections.
"All parties that plan to participate in the elections have to pay a certain mechanism in the state budget if the party is not able to win a vote in the elections," the committee said.
"All problems will not be resolved," international transparency representative Nemanja Nenic told SETimes.
"Everything is based on independent state organisations and their control, but this is the real reason that they have more control.
So far, there is no ratification of any certain party supports, "he said.
Everyone in the political life of Serbia is not satisfied with the new law, but all MPs said the funding should be control.
Miroslav Petkovic, head of the opposition Democratic Party of Serbia, told SETimes that the new law would be allocated more money from parties to the budget and that it is unacceptable to the economic crisis.
"The law is not good, because state resources are not implemented for potential stability -- there is no control over the possibilities of public companies' funds for certain parties," Petkovic said.

Bulgaria has become a country that has become more expensive than Greek and Romanian companies in recent years, due to low taxes, cheaper and geography.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times in Sofia – 22 / 08 / 11
The official statistical statistics show a rise in the activities of Greek and Romanian companies in Bulgaria, trade, industrial and services. [Reuters]
At the time, the economic crisis and challenges in the Balkans are the right to implement a tax on Bulgaria &aposs lowest inflation, reducing the company.
The unemployment system is based on a total of consumption or a single tax hikes on the profits of taxes.
According to official statistics, about 2,000 Greeks and 300,000 Romanian companies are registered in Bulgaria.
The number of companies from the complex Greek capital has increased since 2006, the Bulgarian National Government (NRA) said.
The biggest rise was in 2008, when Bulgaria was able to pay 10 per cent of institutions and personal consumption tax, and the number of registered companies dropped from 619 to 168.
Since then, the company operations in Bulgaria increased by 600 companies per year.
The number of companies from the Romanian capital is a similar option. In 2006, the number of companies, only 33, were found to 272 in 2010.
The data shows that companies in neighbouring countries are among the lowest tax rates.
For example, institutions in Greece are being implemented by 24 per cent, and it is more than two participants in the neighbouring country.
Another effective impact on Greek companies is the government of Greece, which has taken austerity measures under the most serious financial and economic crisis.
According to Theatos Aliidis, director of the Thessaloniki Association of Greek companies, the Greek companies' concern to neighbourhood "is not a new", but the start of this process in 1990.
Recent unemployment costs are a lot of money for employees. [Reuters]
"Everyone who can leave Bulgaria is doing this crisis," he said. "No one has not been waiting for the crisis," he said.
According to EU statistics, Greece is one of the highest countries. The Games, Bulgaria is among the highest in the list.
"The Greek companies are strengthening their operations in the retail industry," Alidis said, praising the climate "of the cheaper circumstances in Bulgaria.
Bulgaria is among the effects of low transportation costs, cheapers and stable economy, foreign companies.
Following the financial reform of the Romanian government, the Romanian companies have started to show more effective in Bulgaria, following the financial reform of the fiscal reform aimed at boosting taxes.
The move of the Romanian government was made in line with the demands of 20 billion euros, including international financial institutions, austerity measures and helping the country to help its economic crisis.
Unemployment tax in Romania is 16 per cent.
Officials, however, resigned as 3 per cent of the number of employees, with the number of employees, more than 100,000 euros.

Recent tax rates have a chance for the country.

According to the NRA, the personnel did not be announced, the tax debt was 187,000 euros (95,000 euros) in May.
Among the companies in Bulgaria, foreign currency users will also be used for a part of their activities.
According to Jazko Dimitrov, head of the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Institute, the number of foreign funds is higher than the number of companies.
Many say this is a positive reason for the country, because there is a job for people in other areas.
However, Dimitrov is not the same idea in the country.
"Increased companies that have been used for foreign funding are returned to abroad.
This is not good for Bulgaria.
We need to find the investors, and we need to convince their jobs to Bulgaria.
These companies are now in the country because they are more circumstances.
The benefits are that. "
According to Dimitrov, the system does not exist with the job, "it has been a lot of major investors, general centres and financial presence to Bulgaria."
"The most important tax is not the chance of the tax, but a total of business in Bulgaria.
If we have a good infrastructure, we have problems on the route and corruption, we have more expenditures.
How will it benefit of tax taxes? "
"There is no policy in order to attract smaller accounts in small villages in the villages, to promote the region and the economy."

According to Montenegrin officials, two independent and international organisations will have better results.
Officials, who argued that Serbia-Montenegro is expensive, say the lack of unity is dangerous to diplomacy and the military.
Dudovic and Vujanovic said the status quo would only raise insufficient changes, and that Montenegro and Serbia will slow its participation in the EU and international security structures.
The first reactions from Belgrade are not positive.
Kostunica promised that the plan, signed with the EU, would be a clear violation of the Belgrade Agreement, calling for the end of 2003.
"The Constitutional Treaty has frozen from the Constitutional Charter, and Montenegrin officials are trying to create an insufficient situation that will lead to a distribution," Kostunica said in an interview Monday (February 28th).
Kostunica said he is trying to survive the independence referendum for the latest proposal to protect him as a result of a consequence.
Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, the victory of Kostunica, opposes the same idea on the state union, but the initiative was recognised as one of the strong defence of Serbia.
"We should hold a two-referendum and we should not give this issue by 2006," Labus said.
"The priority of Serbia is to join the EU, and to achieve better living standards, it is not a joint country that is not a common country," Tadic said.
Vujanovic, meanwhile, argues that Belgrade is not clear of the negative response, and that Serbia is opposed to its own sovereignty and independent status.
The international community seems to be defined by Serbia-Montenegro.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, however, voiced concern about the political initiatives that would bring Serbia and Montenegro into line with Europe and cause political tensions.
Officials in Brussels say the proposal was "extremely surprised", the Beta news agency quoted him as saying.
Following the murder of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, Serbia-Montenegro has been sparked two years in Euro-Atlantic integration, while this year should not be split with consequences, officials said.
US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael C. Polt said Washington will support any democratic agreement between Serbia and Montenegro on state status.
The proposal for Podgorica is cautioned by the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament, which has caused direct elections for the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament, and we are facing a result of the constitution.
The state union argues the protection of the state union, as well as the independence of the debate and seems to be seen as a result of 2006.
This year, Montenegro will have the legal right to hold a declaration of independence, according to the Belgrade Agreement.

"Bosnian politicians are playing with their own future," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said. [Getty Images]
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak urged Bosnian Serb politicians on Wednesday (September 26th) to block a compromise on police reform, a key condition for progress towards EU membership.
"We have been defined, and we will have more time to find a compromise until Sunday," Lajcak told lawmakers in Republika Srpska (RS) parliament. "We will not return to at least a year."
He also met with EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.
"Bosnian politicians are doing the future of their own countries," Solana said in an interview with the Dnevnik daily.
In December, BiH completed technical talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, considered a key step towards eventual membership in the Union.
However, Brussels has made clear that the agreement will not be signed this year if BiH politicians do not reach a compromise on the country 'police structures by the end of this year.
Currently, two entities -- RS and the Federation of BiH -- have their own police services.
Brussels wants all legal and budget officers to be removed at the state level of state.
The EU also urged new police zones in professional criteria and to end police work in political intervention.
The efforts to reach an agreement have been completed for more than two years.
Bosnian Serb politicians see the EU demands as a step forward, and rejected proposals for the two countries to reunify and restructuring the two police.
On Wednesday, Lajcak assured Bosnian Serb lawmakers that there is no threat to the presence of a more efficient police force.
If politicians support police reform, he said, BiH rejects the European path.
As a result, the country will face a "stalemate" in the region, and will continue its neighbours in the EU accession process.
"We will have a positive economic force, which will be able to elect the electoral solutions -- and we will stay on our own future or have a positive impact on the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina," he said.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, however, said he would not accept the removal of the entity police.
"I am not ready to accept nothing in which the Republika Srpska is in a clear way to the Bosnian Serb police in its territory," Dodik said.
At the same time, Bosnian Serb officials have agreed that Lajcak will be able to take effect on state level institutions if Dodik and other factors charged with criticism against Dodik and police reform.
Meanwhile, representatives of the eight main political parties in BiH, have not reached an agreement, despite the fourth round of technical talks on police reform in Banja Luka.
The parties reportedly will continue on Friday.

"We have dismissed the north of Mitrovica," Steiner told the Kosovo public last week.
"I will stay at the same time when I promised that the discrimination will not be done," he said.
The situation in Mitrovica is now hiding, including the main bridge in the region, including the security zone in the region.
Since mid-December, the new Serbian officials have not allowed the police service from the northern Policy Corporation of Mitrovica.
Steiner was part of his efforts to encourage stability and development in the region.
Steiner was in Mitrovica -- local officials in the south of the province were shown to the Kosovo Government Agency (KTA).
UNMIK chief believes that the KTA is crucial for the future of Kosovo, which is an open public life in the region.
Among other projects that have been implemented, the project is expected to develop the lives of life in Mitrovica.
For instance, a rating from UNMIK in the past months said the start of implementing the plan in the north will help the city to end the discrimination of uncertainty in this region.
The opening of a highway that will connect both sides of the city is expected to develop free freedom of movement in this region.
Both civilians and soldiers have started to build a transit pipeline in the southern town of Mitrovica in November 2002, in co-operation with UNMIK.
A French intelligence project is being held in the construction of a 40m-long bridge and a 1.5km north of the project.
Steiner arrived in Pristina for a five-hour debate on the issues affected by the residents of Mitva.
One of the fundamental problems that Kosovo is a smaller.

"Hays Open" sovereignty and independence in Serbia
Natasa Bojanic, 26, arrived in the world as Dodik Sandroglu.
The efforts and the work of a Serb NGO was successful.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 02 / 03 / 09 Photos by Nikola Barbutov
Natasa Bojanic arrived in the world, but not guilty of the society.
Natasa Bojanic, 26, and his family lives in the wake of their friends and friends.
Nevertheless, he is confident that the life can be able to meet with challenges.
Natasa arrived in the world as Dodik Sandroglu.
However, the efforts of his family live without genocide.
The model of Natasa was teaching the presence of the Children Power, six years ago and was completely unchanged.
Natasa Radic began to participate in a two-day death, and started to visit theatre, theatre, concerts.
A "Hellenic Open" programme, launched by the Natasa institution.
The aim of the programme is to win the young people -- preparing to prepare and prepare for a two-day job -- and to make their lives more independent.
"We are doing everything we live, and we do not help us.
We are seeking our responsibility for our own, "he said.
One of the most successful participants in the programme, Natasa, was given the opportunity to work in the Children 'Today.
Everything is the only way to combat the day.
Since the beginning, there has been many tasks to develop the project.
Even though, they say, the "smaller" began.
It is "the primary way", he said, adding that all tasks and employees should be implemented, such as the cafes and employees, or not as a month.
And us shows that it is "a rise and" unfortunately ".
"What is the greatest person of a traditional obstacle," said Tanja Seminic, a representative of Children. "How will you try to work on the children in the Haysin Public Public Orthodox?"
"We should be always clearly, and this is my job," he said.
Over the business, he is defined.
Following their fans, TV station and exercises are at the level of playing.
"My reason is not allowing more TV or not to give a long session in front of computer," he says.
There is no authority and we want some of them to do us, and the law also seems to be widespread.
Tanja Slajonic, a representative of the Children &aposHerzegovina, has made more detailed information about us.
The aim of the programme said the goal is to regain many bridges as possible, and to ensure more independent life.
"Can you think that a person [the biggest] obvious]," Safijic said, "How will you want to work together with the youth in the Haysin Photography?
Everyone can do their responsibility and day tasks.
"We are not very active in the crisis and we have to intervene in the crisis," he said.
About 500,000 children participated in the Children Photography projects over the past eight years.
"It is a difficult co-operation with them.
Many do not know how to benefit from judges.
The buses are discovered and they do not know they will.
"The Children [is] the task of a information centre that can provide all necessary information."
Natasa has been serving as many tasks to develop the project, which was sent to the business couple.
The employment opportunities for Industry have been a controversial issue in Serbia over the past few years.
However, it is easy to find a job, such as Slajonic 'remarks.
"They do not want to show the responsibility of an unprecedented identified identity that should be done in this issue.
The situation is completely different because there is no problem in the history.
The only needs to be removed, removing some obstacles and work, and they are not worried, "he said.
He argues that the accession process in the normal education system should be repeatedly advocated.
"The children, for example, should be able to find a normal schools, for example, as well as environmental restrictions.
The traditional obstacles are unable to exercise such programmes. "There is no need for bridges."
"Therefore, these children are not in the same clashes with children, but also a symbolic development of mutual tolerance and a recognition of differences in the same school," Safijic said.
About 250 hundreds of injuries in Serbia are estimated, but this is not clear.
In particular, the families of disappoint such people.
Those who are not known as Education and social protection systems, many may not be able to convince a number of witnesses.

Husin Hajin Hadzinovic is the new, but a compromise in Srebrenica is still planning to resume the seminar.
However, Hajinovic says, however, the airports will be ready to improve.
This is an example of small businesses that the UNDP is helping to develop here.
The UNDP International Regional Development Programme is seeking to help the country to return to one of its economic areas.
Since World War II, the most wanted suspect was held by the July 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Most of local authorities in the region and the south of Republika Srpska have been under financial support since 1999.
"I don [the UNDP] did not take part in this project," said Hajinovic, who returned to his house a year ago. "The UNDP was one of this, but we have not been able to start if we can start to start."
Husinovic is one of the 166 people in the business loan, which was launched in 2002 and was launched in a three-year project.
According to Alexander Prieto, about 2,000 people have been used so far.
The reconstruction of the factors operating in Srebrenica is now on the establishment of smaller businesses in the region, which can be built before the war.
As part of the project, civil society and local administration are also being strengthened and rebuild water and electricity.
While refugee returns -- about 3.200 Muslims returned to the three municipalities in October 2003 -- the UNDP seems not only to increase this number.
The number of returns in the past 12 months is almost complete.
Several observers are believed to be returned to the region after the 1995 conflict.
In addition, no one is believed to believe that the project can visit them.
UNDP officials say the project is a symbolic symbolic of efforts in the region after the tragedy.
"This is the greatest and main reason for the UNDP decision to continue the project," said UNDP Deputy High Representative Moises Venancio. "We have said that the project should be able to help people and return to their lives."
The plans for 2004 include creating a small loan for women 'businesses, creating a small loan for agriculture, the completion of 17 civil society projects and improving infrastructure.
Hajinovic says the programme is not affected by the benefits of money in the long term.
"People are seeking to help unemployment, and they expect them to work," said Hajinovic. "However, this is not a job.
"The UNDP loan is a big investment that allows the loan to work in the family."
Del Ponte War Crimes Prosecuting Lebances for War Crimes Prosecutors
UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte cited the war crimes tribunal in The Hague that Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic will not close their doors before the trial.
(Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, HINA - 12 / 09 / 03)
Following his mandate for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), del Ponte said the priority is the list of all remaining fugitives.
He said the court would not close the doors of Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and his Croatian General Ante Gotovina before the end of 2003, saying it would not be closed to them.
The third is on the list of 17 war crimes suspects that have been found in the polls.
"The Croatian government must hand over Ante Gotovina to The Hague," del Ponte said at a press conference Friday (September 12th).
Bosnian Serbs are focusing on all co-operation with Karadzic, "he said.
As part of a strategy adopted by the UN Security Council, the ICTY must complete all investigations by the end of 2004, all mechanisms must be completed by the end of 2008.
The programme will be implemented by 2010.
However, del Ponte cautioned that the completion strategy could be dangerous if the efforts to capture suspects at the beginning of the list are completed.
Mladic and Karadzic are charged with genocide because of their role in the 1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the Srebrenica massacre.
Del Ponte, who said Mladic is in Serbia, called for authorities to hand over the suspect.
Karadzic is believed to be hiding in Republika Srpska, which is part of the Serb administration in BiH.
Gotovina, who has since since 2001, has been charged with crimes against Serb civilians during a attack against Serb civilians during a 1995 attack.
Del Ponte claims that Croatian authorities are hiding.
"I think it is the Croatian government and the Croatian government, General Ante Gotovina," del Ponte said.
He said the court will continue to help the international community to surrender to justice, adding that those people are not aware of success and trial.
"I will not see this possibility.
Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina will be arrested by the end of the year and will be transferred to the tribunal.
The court will not close its doors if Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina are in front of the judiciary, "the court said.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said on Friday that the government "does not have any contact with General Gotovina".
"The Croatian service has shown that he is in Croatia and it will be arrested so far," he said.
Racan called on the tribunal to hand over him that he would be good for both the country and to hand over retired generals.
In a statement, Croatian President Stipe Mesic urged Gotovina to hand over his own and Croatia to defend him in The Hague.
Defence Reform in BiH Says New Co-operation
As part of the defence reform process, the Defence Reform Commission submitted its report to the state defence law.
The bill will make Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe candidate for NATO &aposs Partnership for Peace programme.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 20 / 10 / 03
The reform process in defence structures in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has entered a new phase in late September, when the Defence Reform Commission (SRK) submitted a state defence bill to parliament.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown was completed by US military commander James Locher II, who took over the presidency, completed the 100-day mandate of the BiH defence structures in 2004.
The system is a precondition for full membership in NATO &aposs Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme.
The two entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS) and Republika Srpska (RS), will continue to have different entities and defence ministers.
The parties, however, will be united under the military, operational commander and the state level of defence.
The high commander of the BiH armed forces will be held by the BiH presidency, which will be able to compromise decisions.
The defence ministries will be established by defence ministers, only a military commander on soldiers and logistic purposes, while the main commander will be formed through a joint military commander and operational commander.
The military budget will be a complex state defence minister for co-ordination of the military budget.
The head of the primary commander, the joint military chief and the state defence minister, will include three ethnic groups, Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats.
The system was designed to prevent the armed forces to use any of all three ethnic groups.
"These decisions on defence reform are crucial," Ashdown said. "The PfP is now the way to join NATO.
However, the decisions still need to be approved by the BiH state parliament. "
In preparation, the RS Army has 6,000 soldiers, while the FBiH Army has 9,200 Bosniaks and 4,000 Croats.
Under the EC recommendations, the number of soldiers will be reduced to 12 per cent, in an effort to ensure that the armed forces can be able to cope the fiscal circumstances and designed by 1 per cent of GDP.
Both sides will serve in the same university, which will serve as the BiH state and its territory.
The SRK is among seven local representatives of the two sides' defence ministers and the BiH Military Committee, as well as a representative of NATO, NATO, SFOR, High Representative and the OSCE mission in BiH.
Representatives of the EU, the United States, Russia and Turkey were part of the commission.
The state parliament must give the final decision by the end of the year.
With Kosovo dialogue, it seems more challenges
The Serbian and Kosovo negotiators have been more than two months after their meeting to discuss technical issues.
However, many major problems, including the poor issues such as people, have not been discussed.

The son of Mitrovica, Bajram Club, died in 1999, while he died in 19 years and has not been detained for any news for 13 years.
Serbia is believed to be closed with the EU without further issues, such as war waste and people, such as the EU 'medical talks with Serbia, Caku said.
"Brussels is not a serious approach.
At the same time, the issue has suggested that any steps that Serbia will move closer to the EU is a precondition.
"We have shown that we have so far shown that Brussels has not been indicted so far. In any case, some of them will have to be able to surrender in the court," he said.
The broad issues have not yet been among the basic reasons for talks between Kosovo and Serbia.
The process, which began in March 2011, slowly on technical issues.
There is no significant developments such as a compromise on joint border management, but no longer in technical issues such as energy, telecommunications and technical representation of Kosovo.
Membership talks feel uncertainty.
The latest session between the parties was held on December 2nd.
"The next session will not have a clear information on the history of the next session, but the dialogue will continue and that both sides are participating in this process," EU spokesperson Maja Kocicic told SETimes.
In addition, two movements from the Kosovo opposition parties have become more complicated. On February 7th, the main opposition party, the Democratic Union of Kosovo (LDK), called for official intervention.
At the same time, LDK Chairman Ivica Mustafa told the Kosovo state TV that "Kosovo should be assured to discuss Serbia, but also that" the international community should be allowed to ensure that the country is taking a part of its territory of Kosovo and organised crime and organised crime and organised crime, "he said, adding that" Kosovo is in a dialogue with a part of the country

Other opposition party Vetevendosje has asked the Constitutional Court to decide whether it is necessary to approve the international agreements so far, repeat the international agreement and decide whether it is in line with international agreements.
The opposition party also organised two separate protests last month, as the government is seeking to open a compromise with Serbia.
Kosovo Chairman Edita Tahiri said the talks should focus on the agenda this year, while all sides -- Kosovo, Serbia, Serbia and the EU are being taken into account for the priority issues.
He stressed that "Serbia should fulfil its obligations to fulfil its responsibility in the war in Kosovo".
The opinion of Belgrade is completely different.
"There is no mechanism for one of the country," Chairman Borko Stefanovic told SETimes.
"I think this is the idea of Serbia.
Marko Milanovic, an international law professor at the Byttym University in Britain, agrees that Kosovo is very difficult because it is not an independent state in the war, it is very difficult for Serbia, "Milanovic said.
"Serbia has violated the rights of its own citizens, not another state."
According to Kosovo lawmaker Alil Fahiri, Serbia has not spent more than half of euros in Kosovo, and Pristina should not be able to pay for the rest of this summer.
"There is many things that need to be done and more than decades," he said, noting that "Kosovo and Serbia should not be able to reach an agreement on war waste," he said.
"There is no possible solution in the near future," Ferhu said, noting that this is a complex political problem of Serbia.
At this point, however, "any state cannot be a member of the EU, which is unable to resolve its border dispute with neighbours, and that every country should" remember the conditions of the EU survey on border crossings with its neighbours ".
"This agreement will be a situation in implementing this agreement, and the negotiations will be better," said Dusan Yulic, a researcher of the Belgrade Social Policy Institute.

Technological dialogue will be "a smaller" in the process of technical dialogue, because the international community and Kosovo officials are "trying to do everything in order to use the political part of the bridge and support for Belgrade", he said.
The public, meanwhile, will be resolved without key issues.
"So far, the agreements have been accepted with challenges.
There are still a lot of challenges.
I do not know that the removal of the conflict will be taken at the time, "he said.
"No one will have to pay money in Kosovo or if Kosovo will pay another part of the war," Kosovo Serb Sasa Denic, who lives in the southeastern province of Kosovo, said. "How will it have to pay money for money in Kosovo or to pay money."
However, it seems to be optimistic about the issue of all people, as well as the idea of improving the issue.
According to the International Customs Commission, 2.70,000 people have been detained so far and identified identifications.
Kathimerini, the commission commissioner for the war in Kosovo, said that the number of people who have not been found during the war in Kosovo was about 1,800, noting that "the number of people" has been reduced in the number of years.
"This is why we have stopped with us," said Serbian negotiator Borko Stefanovic, who said the scenarios did not see an effective mechanism that would be affected by people.
Gordana Djukanovic, the head of the Association of Serbian victims in Kosovo, said people from Kosovo are in the list of 512 Serbs and Albanian civilians.
"Before the start of Belgrade -- Pristina met with Borko Stefanovic and the start of the negotiating talks, he told SETimes," The negotiation talks will be invested in part of the issue, but that "there is no need to be done on the agenda."
"Our authorities in Belgrade and Pristina have decided to take the information that we support the monuments and diseases, and to take a high-profile step to protect the diseases, and the families' identity 'identification of their identity," he added.

The most important tourist tourist season for the Greek economy is a serious stalemate, due to competitiveness prices, widespread legal procurement and bureaucracy obstacles to the crisis.
This is the most important in Turkey, while Croatia and Montenegro have the share of their hotels and mobile phones that have been frozen by Greece.
As Greece is in front of its broadcaster, we have been defined by the previous Socialist government in 2009, and we have been able to respond to the protocol that envisions expenditures in the region, because it was "completely consistent" in 2011, according to data from the Greek Security Council.

In Greece, the situation in neighbouring Turkey seems to be seen as a country that has a lot of Greeks, the sector 'intelligence figures and many foreign currency.
Gavrias Gavrias, the initiative of the Initiative Staff, says many Greeks who are working in the agricultural sector, such as Perasimis, are in a number of Greeks who are working to Turkey.
"In a time, tax evasions have been repeatedly insufficient for foreign unrest. This is a very unrealistic for the hospitals and intelligence.
However, the owners and enterprises say they will be able to get their bids.
"If they can work, there are many of them in Turkey."
The biggest obstacles to the industry is Gavrias, who has been charged with competitiveness prices of competitiveness, and for the construction of water prices and businesses.
"The best way is to open better, better and more prices.
For that time, the opening of technical investors should be implemented.
Otherwise, Turkey is a more competitive position in both the prices and the right services, "Gavrias said, noting that the sector needs to be more efficient and business.
Apart from Turkey, he added, Turkey has started to be simplicated as an operational force for narcotics.

We are doing to the Romanian coastal Academy, but we are facing a consequence of reports that the country has turned into a new biometric resort to the Adriatic coastal coastal coastal coastal coastal coastal coastal, but in line with the price of prices.
Dubrovnik Mayor Angelo Vlahic, a letter to the largest oil company INA as soon as possible, asked the company to modernise respondents' interests in the southeastern holidays, allowing them to become more easily.
According to Jurcic, a former restaurant from Seagull, the biggest problem is the prices in Croatia.

Turkish Government Reforms
The draft law on reform in Turkey was submitted by municipalities, institutional institutions, business unions and details.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 05 / 05 / 03
The Justice and Development Party (AKP) vowed that a key part of the central bureaucracy will be transferred to local authorities.
As the majority of the Turkish Parliament, the AKP is doing to do so in its reform reforms.
The proposed law, however, is complicated with the members of the constitutional institutions, penalties and business unions.
Turkey passed the parliamentary system in 1920.
Following the establishment of the Republic, the debate between Turks and the United States could not be removed.
In addition, the general elections were unimpossible, because the lack of education, education and communications are not able to vote for voters.
This is the only party system that would facilitate the mandate in Ankara.
The three initiative to the political regime was made after the army was focused on control of the government.
However, the political stability in Turkey after the 1980s declared it.
The government in Ankara has been increasing.
The reform is the agenda of Turkey, but opponents are on the agenda, and a part of the authority, which has been held in Ankara, is under way to reduce the number of personnel staff.
The government has been criticised for years, but has been criticised by the local problems, but the centre has cautioned the decentralisation rate and cautioned delay.
Tourism Special Ozgur was controversial over the presidency in 198-1993, but Tourism Ozgul suggested that the seven region would be created and the mandate of its mandate.
However, conservatives and army have dismissed the war against the PKK in southern Turkey, where many of the Kurds want autonomy are living.
The Special system has been dealing with reconstruction initiatives.
Some fear that the election is a precedent to keep him from parliament.
The mandate is now a single period of seven years.
Following Ozgur, the popular popularist Sulejman Topi has repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly rejected the issue.
Earlier last year, governments have been successful in implementing reform, because they have different political issues, or three parties.
In addition, the dozens of visitors were discovered in the management board, traditionally supported by supporters of the central party.
Nevertheless, reforms are increasing.
At the same time, the IMF also joined the region, as a loan criteria for Turkey, as well as the removal of Stabilisation and Association criteria.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on April 21st that he would welcome a American administration, which is the only president and centre.
The local government reform was one of the main players in the electoral liberalisation of the AKP.
The law was submitted to parliament last week.
As part of the law, there will be a lot of ministers, including foreign affairs, foreign affairs, health, health and justice ministers, as well as municipalities in the municipal administration.
The municipalities' management of the municipalities are under control, while the mandate will be taken by the interior ministry.
The reform will cause some changes in the central government, with the prime minister and the unilateral union of state institutions.
The AKP argues that the reforms would lead to an increase in public sector.
Although the details have been discovered, the country has started to attacked the radical institutions, details and workers.
According to the unions, the ministry will be able to cover unemployment and taxes.
At the same time, municipalities also called for the expansion of the services that will be appointed by the government.
The law envisions the establishment of a local Investment Committee that will be appointed by the government.
According to municipalities, these changes will have the way to win reforms.
In the same time, they refuse some of the reforms that will increase the rise in public external affairs.
They will not strengthen the management of local governments and will not strengthen economic efficiency.
They also warn that the AKP is trying to change Turkish structure.
Despite protests from Erdogan and AKP officials, Turkey continues to hand over the political institutions.
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer accused the ruling party of trying to open the Islamic ideology in the state administration.
Erdogan also criticised Sezer for his resignation of government agencies.
"Ottoman" rise in Turkey
The restructuring of the Ottoman culture and history is a "trade" for identity, but a referendum for Turkey and foreign policy.

The "Ottoman Ottoman" shows a new trend in Turkey over the past few years.
Therefore, it does not understand his popular popularity, such as the "Muammar", which will be detained by the Sulf Sulejman and the hearing of the house.
This is also reflecting the Ottoman history of Ottoman historic history, the exhibitions on the Ottoman history have reflected in improvements of the restaurants of Ottoman restaurants and the Ottoman monastery.
Although this new model is a certain commercial relationship, the Ottoman heritage could be a referendum on Turkey &aposs Ottoman diplomacy, expansion of regional diplomats, expansion of market markets and social divisions.
According to Dodik Zemun, a professor for Ottoman cultural history in Istanbul, there are two resources from Ottoman.
"The first time is to reflect the chemical [of the society] with Europe], to reflect the chemical [of the society] and reflect a balance of the risk of the risk of rising expenditures in power," he said.
At the same time, experts do not see this trend as a conclusion of the Kemal Movement, which is seeking to revive the Ottoman past, as well as the Ottoman ideology.
Earlier, this new trend reflects amendments to the Ottoman culture.
According to Professor Emil Allin, a professor at the Kirkraine University, people see the Ottoman Employment as an unprecedented state.
"Despite all efforts to overcome the problem, the Ottoman is the agreement that has been closed to a lot of life in the spirit of life in the spirit of history, history and protecting many areas," Emil Allin told SETimes.
The aim is to increase the number of people who have more than Ottoman past.
According to experts, "Ottoman" is a peaceful "for the trade of Turkey. [Reuters]
"In addition, people have been reluctant to know that the past has been worried, but now they are not worried," he said.
At the same time, the Ottoman era era has a more different period, and some of them have been discovered in some of them.
Therefore, the people closed to an architecture are possible to see the Ottoman past as "some time".
"However, if one of the long-term term is the end of a delay for us?" he said, "If there can be a disappointment of an ancient disappointment at the University of Galatasaray."
Some experts, such as war, acknowledged that this trend is a truth for the continued isolation of a decade, while others say it is a development.
"Although there is no time about the issues of the Ottoman Employment, the Ottoman Employment seems to be different as a controversial heritage as a policy of policy," Dodik Thessaloniki said, which is part of the Ottoman University in Washington and Ottoman Research programme.
In addition to the board, TV stations are a way to revive the market and restructuring the Turkish market in Turkey and abroad.
"The restructuring of Ottoman [in this period] shows that this is not a stalemate in the market," he said.
According to the board, the unit has been removed from the history of certain actors in the past decade, which has been helped to increase the rise in this couple.
At the same time, the Ottoman heritage may be a point of a referendum on Turkey 'foreign policy and to overcome its identity problems.
The Ottoman Employment Employment is a factor for different identity and religious heritage in the Balkans and the Middle East.

"The Ottoman Employment has been optimistic, peace and political stability in the Balkans over five years.
This is the Ottoman model, the Middle East and the Balkans can be a referendum for Turkish policies. "
"In the Balkans, the peacekeeping in the Middle East and the Middle East, Turkey has the potential to play a very important role in the next ten years," he said.
At the same time, it does not mean to see a reputation of the Ottoman heritage as a "New Ottoman Ottoman".
Earlier, the Cold War II is a consequence of economic needs and geopolitical changes.
The new Ottoman Ottoman monopoly has been removed from the new market in Turkey, "according to the warrant." This is not a cultural broadcaster, but that is not a cultural broadcaster, but the economic life of better life. "
Political commentator Mustafa Mediterranean does not see it as an intelligence initiative. "If the external policy does not exercise it, the foreign policy is an extraordinary vision in foreign policy."
According to the Mediterranean, the Balkans and the Middle East, "If there is no disappointment, there is a risk of frustration."
The residents are worried by the Western Balkans as the protocol policy of Turkey, while the Mediterranean seems to see the risk of Turkish Ottoman heritage as Europe.
"The Ottoman Employment was part of the European policy in allies such as France and Britain.
Therefore, the EU integration process in Turkey has been made in several days, but the Ottoman history is not imposed to Europe, "he said.
"A positive step forward in the Turkish society, which is the most important for the stability of the Ottoman heritage, can be seen as a positive step forward," he said. "In other hand, the society is simply aware of differences in the Kurdish and terrorism."

Belgrade media reported that Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica have signed an agreement ahead of the February 3rd presidential elections, but parties are doing it.
According to the Blic, Kostunica said he must oppose the EU 'plan to send Kosovo if he is not a new decision by the UN Security Council.
Tadic, meanwhile, wants the prime minister to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
According to the newspaper, Kostunica will announce his support for Tadic on Friday (January 25th) after signing a energy agreement with Russia in Moscow.
Belgrade analysts say the support of Kostunica could be seen in the second round.
Tadic will face the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party candidate Tomislav Nikolic, who won more than 4% in the first round.
The support of Kostunica will play an important role in meeting in February.
However, Kostunica 'party urged Tadic' Democratic Party to change a coalition agreement during the mandate of the government.
The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) is calling for a more optimistic policy on the EU, and the party wants the SAA to be signed if the EU does not send a mission to Kosovo.
The DSS says a EU mission to send Kosovo would violate the sovereignty of Serbia.
The platform of Tadic is focused on European membership.
"Hayaj is Europe" in the Union.
"Kosovo is concerned about the future of this country, and everybody can do everything that has done in all years.
And I will not allow anyone to get a key condition.
"I am ready to fight the last couple and I will not allow the identity to ensure that it is better conditions for Serbia and better life," he said.
The Hungarian and Croatian minorities have supported the president, but Kostunica 'supporters are unlikely to win Tadic.
For the support of 6% of the opposition Socialist Party of Serbia, analysts believe Tadic will be forced to survive the Radical Party.
Nenad Canak, leader of the Vojvodina Social Democrats, accused Kostunica of preparing him to form a ruling coalition with Radicals after the second round of elections.
So far, however, there is no sign that it is.
Former Yugoslavia War Crimes War Crimes Prosecutors Appeals
In September, the BiH state court issued the first indictment against war crimes.
Since the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) prepared to close its doors in 2010, cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as the former Yugoslavia.
The court is planning to continue the trial in The Hague, such as former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, and plans to transfer more cases.
Observers say the provisions will create an important impact on local courts and increase the level of discrimination on war crimes.
However, concerns about the local courts are not ready to take such cases.

The UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague plans to complete its work by 2010. [UN]
The war crimes indictment by the state court in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was indicted by prosecutors' prosecutors for war crimes in the Balkans in the 1990s, the 45-year-old Todouff, a part of regional efforts against war crimes committed during the conflict in the Balkans in the 1990s, was charged in 1993, accusing Serbian and Croatian civilians.
This case is important for the first war crimes indictment by the BiH state court in January 2003, led by top international official Paddy Ashdown.
The indictment was drafted by prosecutors who serve as a special part of the court &aposs financial crimes, organised crime and corruption. This is working with international judges, prosecutors and prosecutors.
The special war crimes agency, which will be operated in January, will reflect the establishment of special zone as organised crime.
"It is the first death case with us," said John McNet, the head of the BiH state prosecutor and special zone of the foreign Muslims who arrived in BiH during the conflict.
Following the attacks on the United States in September 11th 2001, some of the remaining people in BiH are increasingly worried about their participation in terrorist groups.
As the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) prepared to close its doors in 2010, local courts in other parts of the former Yugoslavia have been launched in local courts. The BiH war crimes agency will work with the same paper in the beginning of 2005.
According to the ICTY, more than 40 people have been formed since 1993. According to the strategy, the court will continue to be implemented in The Hague, such as former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
According to some court observers, the cases could be a challenge for local judiciary, fair and judges, which have not shown that they are not shown.
Ana Uklac, director of the latest developments at the Centre for War and Peace Relations in London, described the project as "worried about the controversial controversial controversial law on war crimes" in parliament, adding that "trials have been completed in the local level, but it is ready to be ready to see as much as possible."

"The start of optimistic approval of the courts, the establishment of the legal system and the intelligence of prosecutors, but it is possible to think that the workers will be better," he said.
Croatia, for instance, has been formed four courts in Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka and Split, on the issue of several different consequences.
According to an analysis, the problem in small courts could be dismissed. In September 1991, the court 'decisions have been dismissed. It is an example of the case that has been charged with the murder of 13 civilians in Karlovac in September 1991.
Vesna Terzic, a former adviser to the Institute for Peace Studies in Karlovac, said the trial was initiated in a local court in Karlovac, adding that "the two high-level courts have been sent to insisting that the murders of the murder," he said.
Terzic also said the courts are facing local pressure and that the pressure in Zagreb will not be high.
The judges are removing a education process with the ICTY, but the courts have not been unable to start the cases.
According to Terzic, The Hague tribunal is a very important board and local courts, but it is important that the crimes committed are being focused on local level.
"Our country has a major impact on the public.
"All former Yugoslav countries are convincing such crimes," Terzic said. "This is the best way that can be done in different issues."
In Serbia, six Serbian judges indicted for the murder of 200 Croatian civilians in Vukovar in 1991 began in Belgrade in March.
The court, which continues to be seen as a test of the Serbian legal system.
In Kosovo, some cases, including war crimes cases and other international judges have been conducted by the delegation of international and local judges for the past three years are being conducted by international law enforcement, local courts and prosecutors are also positive.
"The implementation of this implementation is a pressure on local judges who will concern about security," said Thomas Monagaj, head of the UNMIK justice party.
According to Monaghan, the BiH state court must be the most important point in the cases of war crimes. "The war crimes cases are the most important, as soon as possible.
Furthermore, the questionnaire and the number of consequences are more unwilling to recognise.
"It is a complex process that has to show all details."
The consequences of war crimes trials will be dismissed, he said.
"We did not choose this case, and I do not choose the persecution of the perpetrators," he said, noting that the cases of serious crimes against humanitarian cases have been involved in serious cases, such as the influence of the defendants' policies, policy or the economic situation.
Serbian Telecom Approves Protection of Telekom
The sale of the Serbian Telekom in 1997 has also expressed their support for the former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic regime.
A investigation was launched in Italy to avoid corruption claims.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 11 / 11 / 03
The former head of the Bank of Belgrade, Borka Vucic, claimed that Serbian Telecom stock stock expenditures have been sold in 1997.
He said the money was not used to support the former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic regime.
In an interview with Italian news agency Anna, Vucic said Yugoslavia won 1.5 billion euros from the contract.
According to the former general manager, 1.2 billion DM was invited to the Yugoslav Development Fund for Belgrade, while the government has been used to pay pensions and cover other social services.
Vucic said the remaining 300m DM was sent to the Yugoslav National Bank.
Following reports in early 2001, Italian media reported that the Italian side had launched an investigation in Rome over the sale of Telekom.
Several high-ranking Italian officials, according to the Reuters daily, was the money that the regime of Milosevic needs in a period of time due to the sanctions.
As a result, a 29 per cent stake in the Serbian Telecom (ET) company, the Greek telecom company OTE bought 20 per cent stake.
The NGET has offered a 70m-euro DM in June 1997, after the signing of the agreement.
The company received 117m euros in the next six months, and 74m euros in March 1998.
Serbian Justice Minister Vladimir Batic announced a recent statement that the 12-nation Serbian authorities will meet in a court in Belgrade, as Italian authorities have helped investigate the request.
The cases will be closed, and there are no information about the courts.
The head of the Italian Parliament Committee of Parliament, Enco Metoo, said the commissioners in Torino, Italy have decided to send the investigations by the committee in Torino, Italy.
He added that the committee is ready to send a delegation in The Hague for "to leave Milosevic".
Following the Olympic Games, Greece Says Conflict for Terrorism
Despite the Olympics scheduled for next year, authorities in the country are taking steps against any political terrorism.
By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 24 / 06 / 03
The attacks in the Mediterranean region last month were the latest terrorist incidents in the Mediterranean region.
Authorities of terrorism and extremist groups have cautioned the possibility of explosive intelligence services in Greece over the borders.
Officials, who are aware of the "Journalist", have been charged with threats.
There are many reasons for Greece to move forward.
The geographic position, which is more easy to other European states, has become a disaster for terrorism groups.
Greece has strengthened the preservation of the long-term coastal coastal coastal coast, and boosts illegal immigration.
One of the biggest dangerous dangers for national security is the Islamic groups, which are seeking illegal immigrants to Greece, according to the government &aposs foreign affairs report.
Three years ago, a number of immigrants have been unable to investigate any key investigations on criminal activities.
Therefore, the Islamist groups are likely to have documents that would allow people to remove their lives in Greece.
Authorities are Muslim immigrants who are currently under the closure of the authorities.
Despite all dangerous threats, authorities have a strong position to the National Intelligence Service (EYP).
The EYP has been in close co-operation with foreign intelligence services in the coalition, which has been charged with terrorism.
Greek officials are concerned about a possible terrorist attack during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
The aim of the aim of the O-al-Qaeda to cause social losses, the Olympic Games Committee and the government of the Olympic Games.
As the most difficult task of the Games, the government is in the government to ensure the safety of visitors.
As Greece joined the terrorist coalition, it was repeatedly dismissed.
The United States, which opposes the country 'O-Qaeda organisation, could become the target of extremism in Greece.
Greece, however, has a lot of experience on the second terrorism.
Therefore, this new threat is a problem that the EYP needs to be taken by law officials.
Ashdown Approves Bosnian Serb officials on Mladic
Paddy Ashdown criticised Bosnian Serb officials on Tuesday, following new documents by the Republika Srpska Army for war crimes fugitive Ratko Mladic in 2002.

The new findings that have been indicted by the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have sparked criticism from High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
The Sarajevo daily Dnevnik reported on Tuesday (November 30th) that the wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic is a report.
The document shows that Mladic was extradited only two years ago by the Republika Srpska (RS) military in BiH.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) accused Mladic of war crimes, including genocide in late 1995.
Mladic is on the list of most wanted indictees wanted by former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and retired General Ante Gotovina.
According to the report, Mladic was extradited by the RS Army (VRS) in March 2002 by RS President Mirko Sarovic.
Ashdown said the VRS is "the scandal", which is not only two years ago, because he claims that he was not in the plan.
The top international envoy in BiH said it is "a sign that RS authorities, particularly VRS, have shown their obligations to the Dayton Accords and the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague".
The document, published by the daily Dnevnik on Tuesday, was supported by ICTY prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who was supported by the UN Security Council last week.
"I believe in BiH, especially in the law enforcement and police structures in RS, is the basic weaknesses," the prosecutor said on November 23rd, criticised RS authorities for failing to arrest one of the suspects indicted by the ICTY.
"This is the question that the VRS is deeply repeatedly extradited to Mladic, and how is the army 'support for co-operation with the ICTY?" Ashdown said. "If the RS is seeking a European future?"
The document, published by the Sarajevo daily (VAD), where Mladic is continuing its mandate by 2001, has criticised RS authorities for allegations that the relationship between VARS and 2001.
"If Mladic and the VRS have been registered in both the VRS and the VRS, the personnel claimed that they were linked to the authorities in 2000 and 2001?" Ashdown said.
The new findings were found at the NATO summit on December 9th.
At the end of June, the Alliance urged BiH to participate in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme, due to fulfil its obligations to the ICTY.
The BiH news agency HINA quoted German ambassador to the country as saying on Tuesday that Freedom Kiton Ottururt, and that BiH is expected to meet the PfP bid at the beginning of December, but said it is not expected to discuss the issue.
He said NATO will be able to attend the report that del Ponte submitted to the Security Council.

Turkey is preparing to reform the policy of border crossings and water resources for EU criteria and international law enforcement.
One of the country &aposs foreign affairs ministry has made two working groups that will prepare a new water law on Turkey &aposs needs and the EU Framework Agreement, which will take place in necessary institutions.
As a EU candidate, the laws concerning Turkey &aposs common sources must be accomplished with the Union, including laws.
Ankara hopes to launch membership talks with the EU in 2005 if the Union is closed to a major chapter this month.
The EU and Turkey are urging Turkey to accept the Union &aposs water standards, signed in 2003.
As the country needs to protect resources, international law enforcement policies must be created between the southern comments that the countries need to take effective effect on neighbouring countries.
The border crossings include 40 per cent of Turkey &aposs water potential.
In particular, the Middle East reported that the King countries will have serious water supplies in the next 25 years and will be among the main resources of transportation in Turkey.
The two major water supplies from Turkey -- Dicle and Frattini -- have been caused for a long time between Syria and Iraq. In the 1990s, the country has decided to send more water supplies to Syria and Iraq. The protocol, which has decided to send more water supplies from Syria and Turkey to build economic growth in poor areas, while the country decided to
While Ankara has signed the latest international agreement on border crossings, Syria will need to ratify a peacekeeping message on Croatia.
Turkey needs long-term needs.
Many experts warn that the country can live in front of the rhetoric and industrial growth as a result of the risk of increasingly sovereignty and industry.
Although the foreign ministry is prepared to develop a major policy, the measures are also under way.
Ankara is likely to send its obligations to international law enforcement obligations that Syria and Iraq have a single airport.
In addition, Turkey will require the participation of countries, which are seeking to block the intervention of third weapons, allowing only to discuss water rights.

Romanian celebrations
Romania passed its path to EU membership in 1999.
The European Commission said on Tuesday that this country and its neighbours will join the Union on 1 January 2007, but it would be possible to be implemented by the most competitive conditions that have been implemented so far.

"It is very important," European Liberal MP Gram Watson said in a speech at the European Parliament (EP) after the future of the bloc. "The EU needs several countries as possible to share our values that we are doing serious challenges," the European Parliament (EP) said.
Watson welcomed the European Commission (EC) decision to advise Romania and Bulgaria to recommend membership in January 1st 2007, as many leaders of the Contact Group in the European Parliament.
According to EC President Jose Manuel Barroso, the two Balkan countries were "a historic success that envisions more safety and stronger".
Barroso urged the bloc to allow the European Constitution to resolve the issue as soon as possible, but also assured other candidates to be closed.
"We will be able to talk about the words that we have given membership perspective," Barroso said.
Meanwhile, Roma celebrations were unable to leave during their celebrations.
President Traian Basescu warned that the country is not closed.
"Our way to join the EU will be a rich, but it will not be a lot of other things," Basescu said.
"We are trying to live in a climate where we are convincing our performance," he said.
Romania has reached the aim of a long-term and long-term reform process.
However, Basescu said, "medium-level performance" is being shown ".
The lack of practices is in a new monitoring report, which submitted to the European Parliament, the EC said.
It is a sector that has a concern.
The report warned that "there is still a real risk of the payment agencies" that they have not worked for membership.
As a result, Romania could lose 25 per cent of EU agriculture funds.
The EC faces a difficult mandate.
Although some technical EU member states -- France and Germany -- have not yet approved the accession treaty, which has not been approved by Bulgaria and Romania.
While praising the "sustainable progress" in both countries, Barroso assured European lawmakers that the EC will establish a mechanism for full co-operation and progress.
Both countries will have to report a EC report in six months.
The judiciary reform will still meet criteria in the fight against corruption measures and the fight against organised crime.
If any country does not meet these criteria, the EC will enable a special protectorate that will suspend the judicial co-operation and the current EU member states' obligations to recognise the court decisions.
Some EU officials, such as the head of the EC Special Board in Bucharest, acknowledged that the weapons could be a "bad" that will affect more citizens.
In Brussels, however, this is a pressure on Bucharest and Sofia to continue reforms.

President Georgi Parvanov said EU membership is the most important project for Bulgaria &aposs future.
Parvanov added that Bulgaria has signed several agreements in the past, but it is a step forward with other European countries.
The EC said the two countries' progress towards EU membership has made a "stable reform process, after the end of 1989, and that it has been turned into a major transformation of communism".
During a press conference Wednesday with EC President Jose Manuel Barroso in Sofia, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said EU membership would lead Bulgaria to economic and social development.
Although there is no reason for the reputation, Barroso said it is not a reason for the exercise, urging authorities to focus on the implementation of reforms.
Bulgaria and Romania are prepared to join the Union, which is prepared to become 26th and 27th.
If these requirements are not met in the first three years, the two countries could be implemented in implementing the free security measures.
The EC said that both countries will establish strong monitoring mechanisms to ensure their actions.
At the same time, Sofia and Bucharest will be able to submit a report on the progress made in implementing the necessary measures, and to submit a report on March 31st.

Otherwise, the EC could block the Bulgarian airport to enter the bloc &aposs airport.
Barroso and EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who also served in Sofia on Wednesday, said the protection measures under the accession treaty are based on Bulgaria.

The high widespread waste of the former Russian aircraft is reminded by tourists in the Montenegrin coastal city of Tiva, and sparked homes in Boka and near the region.
Media reports suggested that the Freedom "has been trying to work on the poorest cars.
The Montenegrin government has proposed the Russian airports to Podgorica Airport.
The airport will have more transportation capacity and will not affect the tourism sector.
However, the government does not want to send this effort by the two Russian planes, as the 86 and Technichev are seeking to invest about 100,000 Russian tourists in Montenegro a year.
Russian remarks are opposed to the law on tourist agencies that have been transferred to the Montenegrin River.
They want to use two Russian ambitious plants, due to low prices and passports.
According to the Montenegrin media, the government will work to transport Russian planes to Podgorica this summer, but the first time will be able to elect the law for 86 and police to 154 for 2009.
At the same time, the government will also allow Russian operators to see alternatives.
The law will replace Russian tourists from Podgorica Airport.
Despite the possible effect on tourism, Tivat local authorities and the general media are supporting the law, despite the possible effect of visa-free travel.
All of them will not affect the tourist period.
Snezana Vakovic, head of the Association of Budva Tourism, said Russian tourists are still concerning Montenegro this year.
"The prices increased by 10% to 20% last year, but many reserve reserves in early years," he said.
In addition, many Russian tourists are seeking investments.
Montenegro announced 2.3 million foreign tourists last year.
In addition, the World Tourism and Several Council of Tourism announced that the tourism sector is expected to increase by 10% over the next ten years.

Prime Minister Nikola Spiric told the opening of a new mechanism earlier this month that Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has been closed with almost 4% of the ethnic conflict, but Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has been closely closely closed with its complaints, and more than 900,000 people live.
Since the end of the conflict, he said, 480 people were killed and about 1,140 people were killed.
Among the predecess, 39 are training experts, with other jobs.
In addition, 50 workers were injured.
In March, six intelligence people died.
The first was killed in Doboy on 17 March.
Two workers were injured during a couple near Split.
Three days later, two police officers and a civilian defence members were killed in Gorazz.
Despite the general threat of the decision, BiH will have a long time to claim that BiH is not unfair.
Experts say the mechanisms will be at least ten years and will need about 4.9m euros to support their work.
Others say this could be able to get ten years.
The uncertainty is a major problem.
In addition, there can also be "unrest" between the people, such as territorial losses and territorial integrity.
BiH praises the potential for the effective natural gas supplies and tourists.
However, there is no obstacle.
This dangerous presence is limited to other activities such as the campaign and beyond.
The former Yugoslav National Army (JNA) was the largest military force in Europe.
Several hundreds of ancient personnel and ancient injured.
During the conflicts of the former Yugoslavia, all sides have no dangerous weapons.
As a result, the entities have not been injured in various products of illegal immigration.
So far, there is no significant mechanism.
Several companies participated in the study, where many countries are supporting financial support.
Nevertheless, BiH is still a high risk country.
Most of the victims are children.
Others include farmers and prosecutors.
Those who live on their homes are also pushing, and the radical units have drawn a report on their disappointment.
Following the death in March, intelligence officers, who served near Doboy, have made it clear that they had not been able to find a 122m euros.
Since then, work has been suspended.
The European Commission is estimated that 67,000 explosives and about 650,000 explosives are still affected by the Framework Action Plan for 2009, but the international community will have to intervene for implementation.

The controversial law, which helped suspects indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, was initiated by the Serbian Constitutional Court earlier this month.
The controversial debate over the law envisions almost half of the ruling coalition in Serbia.
Constitutional Court Chairman Slobodan Vujanovic said the decision is not a real government for implementing the constitution.
According to the decision, "an extraordinary movement" in implementing the law was removed.
The Democratic Party of Serbia, the Socialist Party of Serbia and the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, which allowed the law on March 30th.
Since then, Human Rights Committee argued that the law is unconstitutional.
Speaking to the organisation, Biljana Kovacevic-Vuco welcomed the constitutional court move.
"This is a good decision and the ruling coalition will be able to win time," he said, noting that Kovac-Vuco, Serbian Finance Minister and G17 Plus leader Mladjan Dinkic is seeking to submit a proposal to change the law.
The law, he said, is a "major risk" for the ruling coalition, because G17 Plus will not accept all the demands of Socialists.
According to G17 Plus member Kikija Milivojevic, the party is trying to raise the key challenges in the law.
"We welcomed the decision of the Serbian Constitutional Court, and we think that the committee is true on the law," Milivojevic said.
The Socialist Party official Ivica Dacic criticised the Serbian Constitutional Court, but said his party would decide.
Dacic said the Serbian government is not under risk of the Socialist support of the Serbian government.

Although authorities are unwilling to hand, they hope that the voluntary facilities will be acceptable.

The two governments -- Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- the Republika Srpska (RS) -- have started taking steps to fulfil their obligations to hand over war crimes indictees in recent weeks.
The obligations, however, do not mean that police are doing dozens of operations.
Several, former Serbian Army General Momcilo Perisic has been transferred to The Hague on Monday (March 7th), when he announced that he would hand over his actions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo.
A analyst said the authorities see it as a way to respond to international pressure without failing to hand over their own political future.
"This is at least a number of smaller revenues, because many political unrest and do not want to see their future prospects," the BBC analyst for Southeast Europe Gabriel Paris said.
The EU, the United States, the US government and NATO will focus on the international community in BiH and Serbia-Montenegro.
Serbia and the United States are facing consensus: the arrest of war crimes suspects or US aid to the EU.
Government General Vladimir Lazarevic, who faces crimes against humanity and violations of war crimes committed during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict, is now in The Hague after Washington has suspended that Belgrade should not co-operate with the tribunal.
Washington has also removed a group of experts to support the Serbian government.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, meanwhile, dismissed the suspects' visit to Belgrade, saying there is no new reason that the indictees would be frozen in Serbia.
Since the problem of BiH, NATO has frozen its invitation to join the Partnership for Peace programme (PfP), Paddy Ashdown, the top international manager in BiH, has cautioned that the RS leadership has sparked several officials.
The move came in response to a single war crimes suspect since the end of the 1992-1995 conflict.
Despite the latest tasks in December 2004, Ashdown argued that BiH would be responsible for the entity if it refused to resume the PfP membership in April.
Prosecutor Todorovic and Boban Simic are trying to surrender RS police and EU peacekeeping forces in January, and the RS politicians have shown a way to pressure on voters' sovereignty.
"The RS leaders [do not] do not want to give up the exhibition [from], but they want to convince both sides [the entities] as soon as possible -- to convince all indictees to The Hague," Parvanov said. "They are now encouraging to encourage
This is a major progress, but the real actions should be removed. "

Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat promised on Monday (March 17th) that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (KTC) will defend their interests in international arrangements if it won the presidential elections on 17 April.
"I am confident that the Turkish Cypriots are responsible for the international community," the leader of the Turkish Democratic Party (CTP) told reporters after a candidate for president.
Talat will serve as the chief negotiator of the Turkish Cypriot Rauf Denktash, 81-year-old Rauf Denktash, who won the elections next month.
Last year, CTP leader Denktash was a symbolic advocate of the UN plan to reunify Cyprus.
However, efforts to end the Mediterranean island over 30 years have been sparked after Greek Cypriots rejected the plan in April.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots supported the peace agreement, the Turkish Cypriots joined the EU on 1 May 2004, because the KTC is not recognised.
Talat was discovered in October with the previous government led by the leader of the Turkish Cypriot president, Sergey Denktash (DP).
However, he arrived in a stronger position on February 20th, bringing his party in early parliamentary elections.
The CTP won 24 seats in parliament, with a clear increase in seven seats.
The victory of Talat, who promised to resume peacekeeping talks during the campaign, described the Turkish Cypriot community as a sign of strong support for the reunification and EU membership.
Talat is expected to head the new Turkish Cypriot government on Friday, and is expected to head a new CT-DP coalition cabinet.
The CTP will be sold to seven ministries, under an interim coalition agreement last Sunday.
The DP will be given three ministers.
The process will be submitted to party leaders to ratify the final agreement on Monday, while the contract is expected to take place on Tuesday.
According to reports, the ministers will be submitted to the ratification of Denktash on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Albania, electricity, country possible
The lack of a safe electricity supplies in Albania is not a difficult situation, but investors are not sparked.
However, the new mandate for the state power utility is likely to become more likely in parliament.

In Albania, the transition process of democracy is forced to take part in major circumstances.
The biggest problem for Serbian citizens is unstable over the long-term electricity supplies.
In the former regime, the number of people need to meet these requests, and the country has also been in the position of energy exports.
The new situation in Albania is a more poor problem in the country since 1990.
Many Albanian citizens are considered part of this electricity problem.
Albania is not the only one of this problem in the region.
The situation in Kosovo is the same.
Balkan countries have negative effects of the closure of the Soviet power plants in Bulgaria.
Albanians say the last historic symbolic symbolic of their lives is the worst.
Last day, the expenditures and similar energy operators are very difficult.
Nevertheless, there is a lot of losses, but it seems to be a result.
The new head of the Albanian Electricity Company KESH, Gjergj Boxhi, returned to his country after training in the United States.
The World Bank and other private financial institutions are also taking a serious experience in the country, where the tasks are taking place in their tasks.
Bojaxhi served as prime minister of Trade, Economic and Energy.
Hydropower plant plans are working on plans. [Gent Shorku]
Bojaxhi, 33, attended KESH in March, and is currently one of the most difficult tasks in the country.
There are many serious results in the distribution distribution -- the energy issue is possible to win elections, or the same reason.
Bojaxhi should be able to open a solution that will represent the Albanian people, and foreign investors in the country that are concerned about the electricity situation.
So far, employees have been increasingly worried, and Bojaxhi shows that there is a credibility and model that would create many steps to implement a solution.
Albania has some complaints on energy production.
The manufacturing is based on climate conditions for hydropower and injuries.
Currently, the amount of risk in the country is the lowest rates and reserves.
As a result, only 50 per cent of the electricity needs.
Instead, it is possible to import electricity, but also a lot of expenditures.
The country has to meet its power needs to meet other countries.
What is the solution?
According to Bojaxhi, various methods should be removed.
Bojaxhi focuses on improving efficiency and enhance the employees' employees.
In addition to the media, Albania is concerned about the situation, and more important groups are taking a variety of campaign to pay the electricity money.
As the agenda of the privatisation of the company is not on the agenda, current facilities are focused on modernisation and building new power plants. [Gent Shorku]
In some areas, Albania has a poor to pay electricity bills, and it has a bad reason for the electricity bills.
Commercial use users have almost a smaller scenario on the bills, while local consumers, especially in the northern part of the country, are not able to pay their bills.
About 25 per cent of the users' users.
Bojaxhi is the first KESH manager to find these consumers' electricity, which is the first KESH manager to resolve the problem.
This is only a first step.
The long-term solutions, which will allow KESH to provide a safe and stable power supplies.
The institution, for example, is planning to privatise distributors in the next two years.
Bojaxhi believes that the distribution distribution distributors will be improved in the number of improvements in the private sector.
The new telecommunications pipeline between Arabia and Podgorica will bring the power utility more expensive than the use of users.
The plans to build a oil plant in Vlora, south of the country.
A new hydropower plant in the north is planning to build a new hydropower plant.
At the same time, there will be a smaller projects in Albania.
International donors are very serious contributions to improving the problem.
Meanwhile, some say that the public could be able to raise more austerity.
According to Bojaxhi, this is not possible.
So far, the country has been a very serious increase in prices, and a new number of Albanians will create a major social security for many Albanians.
Bojaxhi says the voter option could be found after the austerity problem is resolved.
As the agenda of the privatisation of the company is not on the agenda, the current facilities are focusing on modernisation and construction of new power plants.
Bojaxhi acknowledges that problems will continue in the next two years.
foreign investors, who need to be needed for renewable power supplies, hope that it would be a reality solution to the most serious problem in Albania.

Other measures include inflation in the region, and the region is being detained.
More than 60 people have been killed since 2003 in Asia.
Most of the victims were the farmers who have a direct connection with the hospitals.
While the people are difficult to face the disaster, experts fear that the female has turned into a battle that could be easily easily easily transformed into a type of human behaviour.
In Europe earlier this month, the dangerous threat was injured in Turkey, Romania and Russia.
On Wednesday, Britain announced the second prime minister in a week: a paper of the H5N1 from South Africa was discovered.

According to the defence bill proposed by the Federation government, women in Serbia-Montenegro will be formed in the future.
The implementation of this is not a normal army.
However, with 19 and 50, women can call for "necessary information and training" during the war, and that they can have to serve in the forces.
According to the law, women who elected professional military service will be recognised "other judges" on the rise, reduced hundreds and other rights for children.
Women, who have women and ten lives, will not be called for soldiers, including women and soldiers.
The law enforcement of the Women is only one of the most important relevant relevant intelligence.
Another possible is to buy the "purchase of military services" -- to pay money to the reality.
Therefore, this option will benefit for Serbs who want to fulfil their compliance with a obligation in their own citizens.
It will be adopted by the Council of Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro.
"Our representatives of the law suggested that the military service has offered 1,000 euros, while in Turkey is 5,000 euros.
"It is believed that a reality of prices should be between 2,000 and 2,000 euros," he said.
Several NGOs, however, do not see the best way to resolve the problem of the men who live abroad.
They say such a system has created an unfair discrimination in the field of unfair soldiers.
"Several countries have been discovered by the army, or not only a relative relationship or military service," Petar Milicevic of the European Foundation office in Belgrade said. "There is no reason that there is no longer a lot of money that has a lot of money, because there is no longer a lot of jobs in a country, because it
Milicevic acknowledged that the bill shows a liberal liberalisation of military obligations in Serbia-Montenegro.
"This is certain that the military service is reduced by six months.
The armed service was 13 months, and the current bill will take six months.
"We hope that this law will enhance military service in a world that is professionally professionalism."

Bulgarian and Romanian lawmakers joined the European Parliament last month. [AFP]
The European Commission (EC) issued a report earlier this week on the long-term progress in Bulgaria and Romania to join the bloc.
The EC said that the two countries are likely to join the Union on 1 January 2007, but it could be possible to speed up the reform process.
Otherwise, the security situation, which will allow membership to end a year.
The EC also called on organised crime and corruption as well as areas of concern, and urged Bulgaria to continue reforms in the judiciary and administration.
The commission also suggested that Romania, which has resigned in the accession process, could be able to form a cabinet after the parliamentary elections in mid-month, with nearly two months of delay.
The report repeatedly conceived the expenditures.
Several observers, including the European Parliament report on Bulgaria Gul Orden, said the EC expects a slowdown in the process, especially in Bulgaria.
Van Orden told the Bulgarian TV station earlier this month that the EC has been under strong pressure for criticism as possible, due to the Constitutional Constitution and budget challenges.
Officials in Bucharest and Sofia agreed on Wednesday (October 26th) that the EC will take action to implement the recommendations and prevent membership date.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, who described the criticism as unacceptable, said this should be taken as a step towards improving efforts.
Stanishev said the new government hopes the new government would provide delays this summer.
In Romania, EU Membership Minister Anca Boagiu said the EC report is "the best" report on the country so far.
Addressing concerns about the EC should not be sentenced to corruption cases, Justice Minister Monica Makovica pledged on Wednesday that all high-level corruption cases will be made by the tribunal.
The report came about a month after 18 Bulgarian and 35 Romanian lawmakers participated in the European Parliament (EP) as a movement of security for their membership targets.
The parliament was expected in December, but concerns about the two countries' readiness to be ready for membership.
"In this way, the Bulgarian and Romanian parliament will win the EP 'work, procedures and work mechanisms," the statement quoted him as saying. "The two countries will participate in the EU and the people of the European Parliament will be able to choose their full members of the European Parliament."

Authorities are trying to resume tourists.
As a result, the crisis has been removed.
In the long-term term, the water system must be renewed to resolve the problem.
Otherwise, Croatia can wait for every year, and the situation can wait, and there is no hope for a country that is seeking to develop the tourism sector.

Tourism Agency for Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina
In an effort to recognise Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina tourist analysts also hope that the country is still still going to change its image for abroad, enhance the economy and to ensure that people in the region can be able to see their own country.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 10 / 03 / 03
We proposed that a average number of people who want to go to Eastern Europe, this proposal would likely lead to the return of the villages, villages and mountains, who were killed during the death.
However, both republics from both republics in the country are now seeking to change this outcome. The international tourist fair, which joined last year, was the first time of the work of the work.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is known as a country that has become a difficult war.
Because of that, there is a quality and safe country, but the real situation is different.
In co-operation with the Republika Srpska (RS) Commerce and Tourism Ministry of Trade and Tourism, Bosnia and Herzegovina (RS) is seeking to reflect a single country that is the only country with a single country that enjoys the geography between the entity and the Tourism Ministry of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
This is not a step forward in the partnership.
Since two years ago, tourist agencies in the country have been trying to work separate.
Wilson Elizija, from the Office of the High Representative (OHO), has been defined by 2001, when he stressed the natural disaster between Sarajevo and the Jahorina Foundation of Sarajevo. Van Eelementary agreed that the country has decided to meet its tourists to recognise all recognition as a Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Earlier, NATO and the Sarajevo Economic Regional Development Agency launched the project "for Bosnia and Herzegovina Tourism".
Following the two partners' slowly slowly, the republics' tourist units have been removed to tourist events since then, and the country is producing goods in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
According to Van Eelementary, who is working in the economic part of the OHO, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a major job to promote the security of Bosnia and Herzegovina, security and the peace environment in the country.
"It is clear that no one will not want to invest in a country that is not positive," he said.
"This is not limited to tourists," he added, adding that "It is the first time that Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the first time, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina," he added.
We know that the national parents in Koha and Sutinska are able to see that we are doing to the season of the former War Crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), where we are doing to the tourist season.
Aviovic said there is many things that Bosnia and Herzegovina can do in this way -- it is not clear that there is no compromise -- such as the car, pharmaceutical currency, Ukrava, Nera and Drina.
The country is "an archaeological and natural disaster", he says. "There is a chance of the tourism.
"We have been very important to enter a strategic mechanism." It is a very important point for the development of tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina. "
A operator in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is working for a decade, believes it is the best to develop tourism.
Tim Cerny believes Bosnia and Herzegovina is a "fundamental".
He is working in a car and partner in the Sarajevo Green Visice tourist company.
The company is being held in the race, traffic and other events.
They are not a major hotels, but also for tourists, "he said.
Aviovic said tourists have shown the events of cultural heritage, adding that Katarians' 'arrived in the world with the Islamic and Orthodox architecture of the Islamic and Orthodox architecture.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has shown that the work to promote all circumstances is showing that people in the politics have not shown that there are no rest in work.
"One of the consequences we have made, the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina through tourism.
Tourism pensioners reflect the problems of the politics. [We] are in a major relationship with the RS Ministry of tourism, and we are also interested in a major relationship with the tourist fair, "he added, adding that all tourist sides in the country are trying to present the best way for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
However, everything is important -- a new market for the products or a new market -- the foreign ministers can change a negative impact on Bosnia and Herzegovina, and how people can see their own countries and see their assessment.
"There is no need to change people in Bosnia and Herzegovina," he said.
"It is clear that Neretva is a bad and it should be acceptable.
Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina can see all residents of the United States as well as France.
"I think this will increase the value of the country."

In an interview Monday (July 31st), Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Serbia will not accept a solution to the Kosovo status issue, even if the EU targets a consequence.
"Serbia will reflect Kosovo a solution from Serbia, and the most important one will continue to see Kosovo as part of its territory," Kostunica told the Belgrade daily Denmaras.

The Kosovo law is still part of Serbia, but the UN administration has been under UN administration since June 1999, when the 78 days of NATO intervention has been charged with Kosovo Albanian forces charged with ethnic representation in the province.
About 10,000 Kosovo Albanians died in the 1998-1999 conflict and had to leave their homes.

UN Special Envoy Martin Ahtisaari is said to decide on UN Security Council talks in September.
If the agreement is reached, the Security Council could be able to resolve a solution.
"The arrest of Serbia will reiterate that Kosovo is part of Serbia," Kostunica said. "This is not a legal and constitutional reform."
However, he also met with the leader of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, who said Serbia would "fight for Kosovo", saying that Serbia will be able to win independence.
"Serbia has been applied to legal agencies so far, but it is not a true," Kostunica said. "In the future, there will be such as this."
Serbian Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic said on Monday that the army was not prepared to fight the possible recognition of Kosovo.
"However, we think that the armed forces are ready to prepare to join the armed forces," Stankovic said during his visit to Novi Sad.
Meanwhile, the next two-day round of talks on Kosovo is scheduled to start on 7 August and focused on local reform and minority rights.

We protect the state and citizens of all citizens, such as protecting them, "the prime minister said, refusing to announce such actions such as Serbia.

BiH politicians criticise lack of police reform

"If there is a deal on police reform, the EU cannot sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [Getty Images]
Bosnia and Herzegovina has removed a new draft proposal on police reform in the country, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Friday (August 31st).
"This is difficult to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (SAA)," Rehn said in a statement. "Bosnia and Herzegovina now has the risk of its neighbours and the European path."
The comments came a day after the leaders of the most influential Bosniak parties -- Haris Silajdzic and the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), Sulejman Tihic, from the Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SDA) and the Party of Democratic Action (SDA).
They said the plan was not complicated by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak and that the Republika Srpska (RS) is not in accordance with the principles of the EU.
"This police reform is not only a police reform, but the law of ethnic police forces," Tihic said. "We cannot accept this."
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, however, rejected the proposal as "unacceptable" and "constitutional".
"This initiative does not support our balance on police reform and is a solution to a compromise solution," Reuters quoted Dodik as saying at a press conference.
In 2005, the EU has made it clear that it could be possible if the country has reinformed its police force in line with European standards.
The European Commission (EC) said the two entities -- RS and the Federation of BiH -- are the three countries to ensure that police have their own police forces.
The EU wants to ensure that all legal and budget duties on police are at the level of state level, the police does not work in political intervention, and that police in ethnic areas are not acceptable to professional criteria.
The attempts to ensure a deal were blocked by Bosnian Serb parties.
As a step forward to the police reform of RS, the parties have blocked any proposal to reunify the two police forces and reunification of the country.
Following allegations that the plan was violated by EU principles, Lajcak said on Thursday that Silajdzic and Tihic "proposed a" fair and exercise ".
"The only entity in this proposal," the High Representative said. "The only entity will benefit the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will benefit BiH to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union."
At the same time, Lajcak, who also served as the EU special representative in BiH, promised to help the country &aposs path towards EU membership in July.
Last month, Lajcak cautioned that the SAA talks were completed in December, but cautioned that the agreement will be signed by the end of September, if the police reform is reached by the end of September.
He voiced support for Lajcak 'proposal to facilitate the agreement, insisting that it is in line with EU principles.
"I urge all political parties to work together with Bay Lajcak and to reach a comprehensive agreement without delay," Rehn said on Friday.

A total of 22 gymnastics in Montenegro will be implemented by September 2006, as part of a comprehensive amendments to the National education system.
The former currency of the system is among the two groups, including the most difficult loan, fundamental, basic and electoral.
Therefore, students will have a decision on the training of education, even though they will take some details on what they will get.
Reforms argue that the reforms will be more effective on issues, and students will win a major education opportunity.

In the past few years, the Montenegrin community has been in the effort to change in economic, politics and education.
A total of 48 gymnastics will be implemented by September 2006, with a total of 48 in the framework of the National education system.
The former currency of the system is among the two groups, including the most difficult loan, fundamental, basic and electoral.
Therefore, students will have a decision on the training of education, even though they will take some details on what they will get.
The "gymnastics" in Montenegro is the same with the training units of the British weapons, disease, France, and the swimming of Italians, while Italians are not competing with their predecessor and gymnastics.
In the United States, "gymic" was used and "use", while in Montenegro, the schools "were given" unique school ".
Gymnastics can be recognised as a general education institution, aimed at preparing students to prepare university and high education.
In Montenegro, such education institutions are based on the historic date of 1326.
The amendments, under the plan, envisions more control over students' complaints.
Over 90 per cent of students in the first half of Gymnastics are the basis of the rest.
However, a third of the students' programmes should be elected by voters.
Over the last border, the Moba (final) is being prepared to prepare its aircraft.
Meanwhile, the system is crucial to international standards, and the system will be removed in line with international standards. In the coming years, students will be able to produce an exercise in universities, and will facilitate abroad.
A independent institutional board for the Montenegrin education system, Safet Safav, is continuing to work on this issue.
The director of the Education and Standard for Education and Standard, Radovan Oberanovic, says there is no need for students in the electoral circumstances to create a education in the near future, the communities' interests of communities, their interests, their interests and Mobile '.
The electoral teachers' list will be removed every year.
Members of the election are set to be made by students who want to create a education in the future, as they want to create a training system, resources of local schools and religious communities. [NATO]
The renewal of the Gymnastics system is part of the general education strategy, which is in accordance with the government.
The work is also based on the Montenegrin Education Movement for Education Education Studies, a documentary of scientific and education ministry in 2001.
The reform of this strategy is the two basic conditions, including the establishment of the new education system and implementation.
The amendments have been convinced on the principles of democratic systems in other European countries, which are being implemented in implementation of the education system, autonomy, autonomy, freedom of movement, liberalisation and transparency.
Regardless of the fundamental principles of Montenegrin education reform, ensuring the quality of quality, improving human resources, improving human resources, improving human resources, improving the education system, transition education (system), transition resources), and the level of intelligence, as well as the obligation of intelligence and changes.
The amendments also proposed the establishment of the training of youth in the areas where the Albanian population is a majority.
If the ratification is approved, the Ministry of Science and Education will also be given to foreign education.
The reforms will affect students, teachers, school managers and managers, and the benefits of all comprehensive changes will be forced.
Reforms argue that the reforms will be more effective on issues, and the students will win an optimistic training opportunity.
Although some worried about the lack of restrictions and mechanisms for their lives, most students and school manager share the same idea of reform reform.
In addition, students will also be more willing to students.
Authorities are aware that work will be done in order to be successful, because the reforms are successful.

Studies of technological risks in the Balkans
Southeast Europe has been one of the highest risk in the earthquake areas, but it is not a common approach in the region to assess technological risks.
This is also seeking to change a new traffic project.
By Blerta Foniqo for Southeast European Times – 05 / 05 / 08
1: Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Romania (Romania) are the Balkans' Archaeological Movement).
The Balkan Judiciary Council is the region that has the most complicated traffic in Europe.
Sismic movements have been caused to earthquakes in the region and caused a lot of diseases.
A small team of Albanian, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Romanian experts have created a new traffic risks in countries, with the US Civilian Research and Development Fund.
The project is the first stage of the Balkans and is to work on the diplomatic risk.
So far, these work was used by various institutions and organisations as independent and different mechanisms.
However, earthquakes and other risks are not sparked to national borders.
In many countries, there are problems such as extremism, insufficient and weaknesses and insufficient preparations.
Experts agree that a common approach in the region is very difficult.
The new project is hoping to be prepared for future co-operation.
The first historic documentary on earthquakes in the Balkans is on the 6th century BC.
In the past decades, many villages and villages have been discovered, or some have not been completely completed.
In addition, there are a earthquake of 6.3 years in the region.
Even more than 80 years ago, the number of female earthquakes was reported.
Do you see this technological movement?
The Balkans are part of a smaller number of smaller places, such as the major Eurasia and Africa places, both the Arab Charter and the Adriatic route.
In addition, the number of radical plants in the region has been created as a reason for the Durres unit.
The earthquakes are not the only threat that region faces.
There is a lot of concerns.
Sejdiu is one of the other things in the region, which has dropped, sovereignty, territorial integrity and territory.
These measures are a risk for environmental, human rights and economy.
They are participating in a death in Ohrid: Mircea Radulescu (Romania), Albert Eurasian), Albert Albert Gaxhi (Open), Albania (Open), Tourism), Necdel Alil Aliu (ORF), Necdem Aliu (Necdei), Macedonia (CRF) and the United States
Jology risks have negative effects in the Balkans, while the economic and political changes in recent years have a more efficient effect on the risks.
Following the fall of communism, many countries in the region have entered a precautionary transition process for democracy.
The development of the free markets in the region has shown that the census economy has been moved to control the population, ensuring the reconstruction and facility, and the majority of the population has made it clear that the construction of the facility is insufficient.
If the region will be taken into account, this opponents can be said to be the news of the future disasters.
The risk of this risk is crucial to the disease of the disease of the Archaeological risks, the agreement and spending.
The new traffic project is a lot of innovation.
He was recognised by the project to open information on the internet, and allows different countries to establish communications.
They also held a death in Ohrid, Macedonia, in late March 2007, and a meeting in Tirana by the end of the year.
As part of the project, the GIS technology is also beneficial for the GIS technology to build a broadcaster.
As a result, a technological risk of a society has repeatedly unveiled different groups to submit a general atmosphere that could affect the country.
The decision was organised by the Albanian Archaeological Research Centre in Tirana.
However, more than those who have contributed to the project could be said to the initiative of a regional issue.
Officials in countries in the past have used different mechanisms and medieval use of information, recognition of technological risks and evaluation.
Even in the same country, the same is possible to recognise the same as different technical and mechanisms.
The success of the project is not closed.
The move is planning to submit the work of various forums and subsidies to officials on the technology and environmental and environmental environmental and to officials in the Balkans, which have been able to submit results.
The information could help authorities to use more effective resources.

Serbia Approves Constitution on War Crimes Prosecution
Serbian officials hope that the new law adopted will facilitate war crimes cases to the UN tribunal.
However, these prospects are still unlikely because Belgrade does not co-operate with The Hague.

The Serbian parliament adopted a law on Thursday (December 14th) that state agencies have the authority of war crimes suspects.
The government proposed the law would encourage the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to transfer some cases to Serbian courts.
The new law envisions two major changes in the judiciary.
The provisions submitted to the ICTY are allowing the Serb courts to be used by the Serbian courts, and is providing full protection if they are able to meet.
The incidents also recognised a murder in Serbia.
The law allows ICTY representatives to participate in all phases and to provide information about the progress of the case.
Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said the new law would remove the main obstacles to the ICTY.
According to the UN tribunal 'strategy, the court could continue to be transferred to Serbia in the process of investigating and evidence, he said.
At the same time, Stojkovic said he expects "the extradition of some cases of crimes", adding that the Serbian judiciary will be able to meet all international standards.
Serbian officials have also cautioned that they expect any cases from the ICTY.
Justice Minister Branko Bjelica said the first trial could be transferred in early 2005.
"I am aware that our cases will be given to our courts," Bjelica said, adding that the first election would be charged with three former Yugoslav People 'Army officers who are charged with war crimes in Vukovar in 1991.
However, Belgrade does not co-operate with the tribunal, but this process has been reduced.
In a report to the UN Security Council in late November, Chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised Serbian authorities for failing to arrest and extradite the suspects, saying at least 12 were in the republic.
Del Ponte accused the government of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica of "a stable consensus against the court" and that he was not pushing to the Security Council ".
Following a report by US Ambassador to War Crimes Pierre Richard Prosper, del Ponte said Washington has no support for war crimes cases in Serbian courts, due to lack of co-operation.
Currently, the war crimes agency in Serbia is charged with more prominent people charged with the murder of Croatian suspects near Vukovar in November 1991.
Three high-ranking suspects Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Mrksic are indicted in The Hague.
Another case was sentenced to 40 years in prison for murder of Albanian civilians during the 1999 Kosovo conflict.

The two leaders are scheduled to sign the agreement in Prague on 8 April.
The agreement will replace the 1991 Strategic Armed Forces Agreement (ART), which is in late 2009.
The new agreement will take effect after the US Union and the Russian Council approved.

"In this agreement, the United States and Russia have sent a clear message that we want to see our two largest nuclear plants in the world," Obama told reporters at the Black Sea House. "We are trying to fulfil our efforts to fulfil our weapons and to fulfil their own global responsibility."
According to the accord, the number of long-term nuclear war crimes suspects, which are currently convinced for both countries, will have to be forced to invest 1550 per cent, which is expected to be lower than 200%.
This is one of the fourth of the 600 war commissioners, which are the first of the ART agreement.

The agreement will help the two countries to "stay on the agenda of the War Crimes", the US chief said.
"If the United States and Russia co-operate in an effective co-operation, the two national interests and progress in the world," Obama said.
Russia, however, warns that the United States could be able to see if Moscow is facing a missile defence system in Eastern Europe, if it opposes Moscow.
"The agreement was signed at a time when both sides have strategic attacks and defence systems," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a statement. "The amendment does not mean that any changes in these levels will continue to reduce the reduction of strategic weapons in both sides."
Meanwhile, a deal signed Friday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised NATO Secretary-General Anders Rasmussen and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
Ban voiced hope that the agreement would "be ratified without delay" to implement a month ago ".

A referendum in RS sparked controversial debate
More than 50% of Republika Srpska citizens are opposed to NATO membership, while the entity has made it possible for a referendum.
By Drazen Remikovic for Southeast European Times in Banja Luka -- 22 / 03 / 12
"If the decision on membership in NATO is time, we should give it a chance to say that people think about a referendum," RS President Milorad Dodik said. [Reuters]
Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik has met the possibility of a referendum last week -- which is now on NATO membership.
Some say that this is a market for the October elections in BiH, but the majority of RS citizens are a real reason for membership in the Alliance.
"Serbs have been very negative, but we have decided to work to establish good relations with NATO, but we have to say that the decision on NATO membership will be able to find a referendum with humanitarian people," Dodik said on March 14th.
While opposition parties in RS supported the referendum, the Federation of BiH has stressed that the issue is a state level.
Aleksandar Popovic, a member of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), said the vote should be done in line with the constitution, a controversial law adopted by RS in 2010.
"We believe the decision to participate in a military alliance, such as NATO, should be able to give the public as democratic and developed countries.
"Our concession is that BiH is military," he said.
Most of the public 'opposition has been restricted by NATO in September 1995 and the RS Army attacked the defence systems.
The primary was organised by RS forces in Sarajevo to send the Marmare pumps and caused the death of 68 people.
At the same time, Mart-June 1999, NATO organised a military action against the former Yugoslavia, following President Slobodan Milosevic refused to sign a Rouch-Development Agreement that ended the war in Kosovo.
Social Democratic Party (SDP) Vice President Slobodan Popovic believes NATO membership is a state issue.
"It is our strategic interest to do everything to accept the Alliance.
I believe that the referendum is used to be used for political purposes, because it has announced a referendum in RS for years ago, but there is no time, "he said.
BiH accepted NATO membership Action Plan (MAP) in April 2009, but the country is still a requirement for resolving military goods.
National Relations Centre for International Relations in Banja Luka, a NGO with political estimates, said RS 'balance to NATO, Serbia' official stance with the Alliance, while the main political forces in the country are in accordance with its official position.
"If the referendum is held today, there is no support for BiH in NATO.
However, I think that BiH will be able to find itself in front of NATO.
So far, many can be changed, "he said.
A survey conducted by the Banja Luka market agency 'Community in November 2011 is the lack of confidence among the RS citizens.
NATO membership is supported by only 26% of the population, while 55% oppose membership in the Alliance.
About 19% are unacceptable.
In other news, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supports the idea of 81% of BiH 'accession to NATO, while only 12% are opposed to membership in the Alliance.
As a result, 5.7% of the BiH population supports NATO, while citizens oppose this idea.
One of the ten participants -- 11.1% -- is still unacceptable.
Bojan Vlasic, 27, a Banja Luka lawyer, said NATO has organised two places against Serbs, so that BiH should not be a member.
"I support the referendum [full support] and I am confident that the RS people will vote in NATO.
"It is completely completely disappointed by the RS 'intelligence people and civilians, and supporting a military alliance," he said.

Kosovo Serbs gathered in Mitrovica. [Reuters]
The plans for Serbia to take over its territorial elections in Kosovo on May 6th and could cause a force to increase the risks between the two countries.
However, some analysts say Pristina should allow the elections.
Representatives of four municipalities in the north of Kosovo said on Wednesday (March 21st) that Serbia wants to hold local elections in Kosovo.
According to local media reports, representatives of the Kosovo Serbs rejected the institutions of Pristina in a recent referendum, which is not recognised by Kosovo Serbs.
Kosovo Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said the police are preparing a operation aimed at ensuring Serbia ’ s vote and that EULEX and KFOR will be active.
"We claim that Serbia will hold the elections, while we should not respond to the election agenda, we should be ready to respond to the authority of Kosovo, personal personnel and architectures in order to enter the country," Rexhepi told Kosovo Radio Television.
The peacekeeping force will not be convinced, he said, if the Serbian groups are trying to hold election meetings.
Serbia says it is a constitutional obligation in Kosovo, which has declared independence four years ago.
More than 80 countries are recognised by Kosovo.
The elections in Kosovo should be organised by Pristina, UN Regional Regional Regional Regional Committee member Gerhard School told SETimes.
"For Kosovo, it is more important for everyone.
"While the media refused to law and importance, the rest can be removed," he said.
He said the elections could be blocked in southern Kosovo, but that will not be done in northern Kosovo.
A successful initiative to stop the elections will be more defined, and that Pristina is not any real influence in the north.
"It will be very successful to stop the elections in South Kosovo.
However, it could cause the incidents, which will have to make Kosovo a European option.
In the north of the Ibar River, it is likely to be the rest.
Another crisis that will cause the Kosovo Serbs, could be dangerous, "he said.
He added that the international community will likely help the elections in the north to prevent a new crisis.
The international community is in charge of helping Pristina, Kosovo Directorate and Public Policy Chairman Arjeta Topi told SETimes.
"If the international community assured that Pristina will not be held, Kosovo police should not be supported, if it is decided to use the Serb elections," he said.
He said Pristina is limited to resume elections in northern Kosovo.
"The peacekepers and the current situation in the north will be able to prevent the elections.
It can only do that, "he said.
International Civilian Opposition spokesperson Christian Palace told SETimes that the law supports Serbia 'parliamentary elections in Kosovo, but only Pristina can hold elections.
"The Serbian citizens in Kosovo have the right to vote for the parliamentary elections in Serbia, due to the decision on the Serbian Parliament on the elections in Kosovo," he said.
"The local elections are being held by the Kosovo government.
In January, the International Crisis Group called for Serbia to ensure that the local elections would be able to send Kosovo, "he said.

They called on Belgrade and Pristina to join a close co-operation with Ahtisaari on resolving several challenges.
These issues include freedom of movement, relations between the local communities in Serbia and Kosovo, and protection of religious and religious communities.
The local administration is expected to be another critical issue.
The direct talks between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian authorities must begin on 25 January, but talks were detained after Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova died four days ago.
Now the negotiations are expected to start in late February.
In November, the Contact Group has issued a series of circumstances that would not be able to resolve the status issue, as well as other reasons for the 1999 process, the division of Kosovo and the unity of any other country.
The Contact Group said any solution should be accepted by Kosovo citizens, adding that "the current problems in Belgrade" have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly "the Contact Group said.
The international community is ready to "support Serbian democratic forces in the use of this opportunity to improve Serbia", the statement said.
However, the document called for Belgrade authorities to fulfil "consensus" to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Kosovo Albanian leaders have said they need to say that a multiethnic solution should be the only option, but the ministers warned that they "will be able to use violence in order to achieve their targets".
Annan, meanwhile, voiced concern that Kosovo is slow in meeting the standards set by the international community.
Annan urged the province to revive its efforts to achieve their targets.
Another topic of the UN chief was "an increase in serious security cases, including incidents of Kosovo Serbs" targeted by December last year.
Annan stressed that the leaders of the province and institutions should work closely with UNMIK to ensure "responsibility for justice".
Election results face Kurdish reform
In the local elections, voters in the southeastern province have not been sparked by the Party of Democratic Society, but also in a more complicated manner, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has affected the reform policy.

The local elections in Turkey on 29 March sparked the way for a solution to the Kurdish problem.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP), which has been linked to the PKK, won almost all the main municipalities in the southeastern part of the Kurdish population.
The result was a major blow to the Justice and Development Party (AKP), which is trying to support Kurds' support.
The DTP, which has won the most important climate, has won the municipalities, as well as the municipalities in seven municipalities in Southeast Europe and 50 municipalities in seven municipalities, has won four cities and 18 more than in the 2004 local elections.
Erdogan 'party has won 100 municipalities in southeastern and southeastern Turkey, allowing the prime minister to provide a stronger powerful mandate for the reform programme and to weak the PKK.
Following all the force for the Zafer, the AKP opened its first Kurdish television station on the public broadcasting company TRT.
The state officials have been appointed by the public and a crowd.
Erdogan vowed to visit our key factors in the region, promising more investment, more jobs and better social services.
The initiative, which has been criticised by the Turkish opposition, was not a result. The party, who lives 15 per cent of the vote in 2007, is only four municipalities.
The AKP accused the PKK for the end.
"Terrorism is not possible to take a successful election campaign in areas where the PKK is threatening to threat voters and party officials," Turkish EU Chairman Esman Bagtyci told reporters.
According to the daily Milliyet, the results are "a strong warning", according to the results.
In the newspaper, Mediterranean said the DTP is prompting the election results under pressure and the Kurds' interests, adding that the outcome of the Kurdish problem is difficult to find a solution to the Kurdish problem in the near future.
"This is a warning that the AKP is against nationalist, doctor and the only party," said DTP leader Ahmet Erdogan. [Getty Images]
DTP leader Ahmet Ahmet Erdogan described the success of democracy and urged the AKP to change its approach.
"This is a warning that the AKP is against nationalist, doctor and the only party.
This is a warrant for the AKP, which represents a new constitution, which has been pushing for EU reforms, is a way for democracy, "he said.
DTP, the new constitution that recognises the Kurds' autonomous changes -- including the adoption of a new constitution that is recognised by the Turkish state system, and wants to overcome PKK militants.
Despite the last election results, many analysts say the party will not be able to see a consensus from the AKP as soon as possible.
Erdogan did not expect any DTP member so far to hold a meeting with them.
Furthermore, he criticised the party as a terrorist organisation and criticised the PKK for condemning the attacks.
Sedzett Rasim, head of the Turkish Cypriot journalist and Fox TV office in Ankara, says Erdogan 'party has dropped to a political stage that has been established.
"The leaders of the DTP have been more difficult and a strong party to support the Kurdistan Workers' support.
The Radical demands were invited and they were rejected by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and AKP leaders.
This is the result of the basic aspect, and Kurdish voters have been united under the DTP, "he said.
If the AKP wants to regain the security and voting, it has to meet its demands for identification of the Kurds.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan promises a new opening ceremony for the north. [Getty Images]
Erdogan has promised a new opening ceremony for the north. In 2005, Erdogan pledged to recognise the "Kurdish reality" and revealed a new citizens.
However, the restructuring of violence conducted by the PKK in recent months, the country has sparked a serious political pressure from nationalism.
PKK terrorists use the mountains of northern Iraq for years in attacks against Turkey.
The scandal has been spent about 40,000 people since 1984.
The DTP leaders still seem to see the idea of terror organisation, and the PKK is not the Turkish government, but not the PKK to find a more peaceful solution.
So far, all observers have been transferred to the International Conference, which is scheduled to be held in northern Iraq in early May.
The DTP plans to meet with Kurdish groups from Turkey, Iraq, Iraq, Syria and Iran, as well as PKK representatives.
Local media reports that the PKK could suffer weapons.
However, the Mediterranean believes that the PKK will end the pace, it could be a solution to the problem as soon as possible.
"Everything can produce ethnic divisions, democratic reforms and unity of our union, which reflects the Kurdish identification of the Kurdish identity," he said.
However, this goal is to achieve this goal, the opposition parties' CHP and MHP depends on a opening ceremony for the future of Turkey, "he said.
Another key factor that envisions this situation is the power between the ruling party and the army, which is protected by the state.
Lawmakers have been in a conflict with Erdogan and his party for allegedly a "Islamic agenda", while the military has called for an option on Kurdish issues.
In a speech this week, the top commander of Turkey said it supports the expansion of cultural rights, as the basis of Turkish citizens.
Chief of Chief of Staff General Ilker Basbug said on Tuesday that the Kurdish youth are closed to the PKK "a comprehensive strategy" and that the fight against terrorism has been closed, and the fight against terrorism is a "comprehensive strategy".
He, meanwhile, opposed the idea of recognition of a new constitution with the Kurdish identity, said Turkey is not a state with ethnic.
"Turkey is a general identification (highest-ranking identity), which has all its citizens of Turkey, which have equal rights," he said.

Such union means that people will not be able to live in the ethnic town.
In addition, BiH wants to resolve its own problem. In the war between the 1992-1995, there are about 30,000 people.
Claudia Kula, a state official of the International Crisis Commission (ICMP), who has been working with the largest DNA facility in the world, says that a compromise could be possible in recent years, even if the controversial controversial controversial agreement was reached.
"I have been in my job since 1997, and we are today with a difference between 1997 and 2003," he said.
The first time is a "bridge", the ICMP official said.
Although the Federation group wants to open a balance in RS, the RS agency has accepted that it would not be allowed to open the Federation.
He said the entities have already helped more than thousands of transformations to commissioners to commissioners every year, and that the budget is unhappy eight years ago.
In addition, people demanded military protection during their work in other entities.
"If the NATO peacekeeping force [SFOR] does not exercise the interethnic borders, but now," he said.
Everything is the first war in BiH, which has the law on a dozen people.
ICMP Chairman Gordon Bacon said the law could create model in countries such as Iraq, such as Iraq, such as Iraq, where more than 300,000 people died during the 24-year Sadin Hussein.
Bacon is optimistic about the BiH Ministry of Human Rights and Relations that the law will soon be ready to discuss parliament.
"The concerns that the government had taken a lot of allegations," Bacon said. "The government is doing to do everything that the government will do."

Together Technically Caspirations for Bulgaria &aposs Investment Project
The sale of Bulgaria, which has been launched for legal changes, could be sent to foreign investors, citing the government 'bid to reach the privatisation targets in Sofia this year, warning that foreign investors could be sold.
By Alina Michailova for Southeast European Times in Sofia - 02 / 12 / 02
In all of Bulgaria &aposs nurses to all high-level courts since September, the pro-reform process has risen the possibility of achieving privatisation of the pro-government, while foreign investors send negative consequences.
If Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg has been sold this year, the government could face a threat to economic reforms and credit agreements with the IMF and the World Bank.
The sale process, which began in March, is crucial to the social level.
A major part of the Turkish minority in poverty -- about 8 per cent of the population of Bulgaria -- are seeking to sell their products to Bulgaria.
This means that the coalition wants the Movement for Human Rights and Freedom Movement for Rights and Freedoms that the sale is created.
The two major opposition parties -- the Democratic League of Democratic League and Socialists -- who have invested investments in London -- are still seeking to resign of Prime Minister Nikola Vassilev, who is also deputy prime minister of the government.

The consortium supported by the German Deutsche Bank has proposed 110m euros for a 80 per cent stake.

The Supreme Court ruled the application and agreed that new bidders should be able to achieve better financial consequences, according to values from the sale of the Special Accession Protection Agency, which was expected to be sold by Bulgaria.
The consortium, supported by Deutsche Bank, was unacceptable.
The Privatisation Committee insisted that the sale process is fair, and insisted that there is no written.
In the last phase of the fight against the law, the Privatisation Council has applied to the Supreme Court to apply for the Supreme Court.
The board will require a decision to ratify the Supreme Court 'decision or to approve the consensus with the consortium submitted to the vote.
The board could also require a new sale.
The decision will be made by the end of December, the Supreme Court said on Friday (November 29th).
If the visa process is delayed, the government will not reach the privatisation target of 300m euros for 2002.
The government officials say the state budget will not be affected by the end of the year, because the country is sufficient.
However, Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg cautioned that problems facing the sale could cause Bulgaria ’ s investment image.

The attempts to reform Montenegro 'pro-European Affairs Process and reform attempts to reform the education system, according to major figures in the country.
"The main principles of the Archaeological Summit will be created, but it will create only a France, if the current conditions are implemented," Milan Popovic, a professor of political scientific at Montenegro University, told Southeast European Times.
According to the European Commission website, "the three priority of the Bologna Summit: the transition system for three years: transition / physical / physical / phenomena), feasibility and students are recognised."
"Bologna should be implemented in reconciliation conditions.
We have no consequences and we are not enough, "he said.
"A teacher member is normal to have 30 students.
This is why I can go to 50, and I can even remove 100 students.
However, a professional number of students is no longer difficult.
It is a criminal indictment against this education, "he said.
Dragan Krivina, a professor of Foundation in Nikolic, acknowledges that a professional professional is "very difficult" to establish a teacher with 300,000 or 500 students ".
"The students have become more easy for students," he said.
In addition, students need to be closed during the teacher year, and this could not be impossible for a professional professor. "
Montenegro has been a member of the Bologna Summit since 2003.
Earlier in Montenegro, students have been able to leave Bologna for a year ago, and this was the lowest.
Earlier, he was another tour.
The situation has changed with Bologna, and some students should not be able to enter the findings.
"I think this is a good way to work for a teaching teacher, and it can be able to leave the final phase of the season," Kopina said.
Popovic acknowledged that a students should be able to regain a teacher over the year, but believes some universities are not unlikely.
"Political scientific factors will be able to speak in the future," he said.
"I don [don] wish to tell them to give them to them," he said.
Milena Miskovic, a new mechanism at the University of Montenegro, is also the same idea.
"I don ’ t see the idea.
Together, we have pledged to work for us.
"It has caused the rise of the archaeological rating."
Nemanja Djuraskovic, a student at the University of Montenegro, is not completely unacceptable, "said Nemanja Djurkovic, a student at the University of Montenegro.
"It can be a good thing, because I don '' '' '' '' '' '' not rest."
Orthodox Reforms in Croatia
The Croatian government has announced a decision to launch the reform process with the country.
By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 14 / 04 / 04
Following a recent meeting on Croatian armed forces, the NATO delegation urged Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to complete the four armed forces and urge the government to take steps, including reducing the number of current chapters.

The airport envisions a single commander of the three different military commanders, including armed forces and equipment.
In addition, authorities have responded to the decision to establish a special commander unit that will prepare Croatian troops to peacekeeping missions.
Croatian officials have said that the air force is continuing and that the final approval was made.
The defence ministry has sent the idea of a new airport and a lot of money, such as modernisation of current aircraft.
Public and transport helicopters have become the priority of the air force.
They can be affected for military aims and peacekeeping operations.
Military analysts say the bureaucracy process is slowly slow.
The key figures responsible for the transformation of the former Yugoslav Army, which was formed over the details of the former Yugoslav People, have been charged with the basis of continuing efforts.
The NATO advisory delegation said that the country has become a model for the approach of several army and military units.
The biggest challenge to Croatia, they said, is to bring Croatia into a precautionary defence arrangement.
If this change, Croatia will face a key obstacle to full NATO membership.

The Cyprus peace process was repeatedly criticised by the end of this month, citing a widely unprecedented opportunity for the future of the divided island.
The Greek side will sign an EU membership agreement in April, and Turkey has met the best conditions that could be able to join the EU.
Turkish Cypriots see Nicosia as a demonstration in the Turkish side of Nicosia on February 27th. [AFP]] The Turkish Cypriots' plan to join the EU with neighbours in the southern part of the province is pushing to join the EU. In 1989, a series of evidence showed by Turkish communities in Berlin, where the community is seeking
In the north of the island, 40,000 soldiers were needed to ask a solution to the island.
The military presence in this country will take over the doors of a very difficult crisis, since the Greek side entered the EU.
In January, leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party in Turkey, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said his country wants to resume talks in Cyprus, urging his country to call a sovereignty.
Glakos Klaides, the leader of the Greek Cypriots, hopes to open a compromise agreement with the Greek Cypriots.
A deal on the problem that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been pushing for a long-term solution would mean an an important success for UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
However, the obstacles that have been able to reach a solution for years have not been easy.
Following the latest consensus on February 28th, the UN was repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly elected Klaides and Tassos Papadopoulos.
Welcoming the disappointment, Annan said the special envoy, Allo De, was removed from the region and removed from the region.
Although the only person who won the victory in the long term is said to be said to be the Denktash, who has met the final solution.
He said a "vote" was the victims of Turkish Cypriots to implement them.
The planned plan, drafted by Annan, was the model in Switzerland.
According to that, a joint state and a two entity parliament will be established. The Council of Ministers will represent two sovereignty, which will represent the population of both entities, and will represent the Presidency in Sezto, which will be represented in both states.
It was one of the basic issues that have returned to the Rumours' restructuring in the 1974 military couple.
On March 30th, the ongoing referendum on both sides urged the UN Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer to meet with UN Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer to meet with UN Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer in The Hague to sign an agreement on 16 April.
The new elected Greek Cypriot leader Papadopoulos acknowledged some consequences, but Denktash rejected the invitation.
Annan, who announced the way for the production, said he was "a degree".
"I am confident that there is no similar opportunity and will not be arrested," Annan said, adding that the Greek Cypriots "have been taken from their interest" to decide on their future ".
US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher announced that Annan supports the statements.
"We have very completely shown that the Turkish Cypriots have the opportunity to fulfil their own future and the right to vote on a social issue," Boucher said.
The first effective effect is that the Greek Cypriots are not expected to sign an agreement with the EU. The European Commission (EC) spokesperson Jean-Christopher Palestinian expansion will be planned as planned and will be signed by the EU ", said the European Commission".
Speaking to EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen, Palestinian warned that the assessment of Turkey "could affect the EU membership prospects", adding that the divided island would be "installed" to start accession talks on Turkey ".
"If there is no agreement on Cyprus by the end of 2004, there will be a number of countries that have been closed to our membership, such as a country that has been closed to our member states," he said.
Although the Turkish Cypriots join the EU, there will be a more active film.
The Turkish Cypriots, which will send their homes, "instead of voting", continue to change the influence of the north of Cyprus' population, but could not be expected to improve.
The "Turkish Privatisation" programme could continue to stay as the candidates from the residents of Anatolia, as well as the poorest parts of the local public.
Turkey can be able to see the north of the north, he said. It would mean that Turkey will be completely completely completed by the EU.
However, Turkish leaders could decide if they are not aware of their membership circumstances.
Some gathered with the plan of Annan. [AFP]
Furthermore, Turkish Cypriots can be able to promote a reunification agreement.
Greek Cypriots say the suspects on the Annan plan have been convinced that Klaides' 'was not elected in the elections, which will be able to meet the number of refugees and property claims.
The latest bill is still limited to their votes as a member of the Turkish Republic of Cyprus.
Turkey, the neighbouring part of the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, has been a major trade centre since the former calls.
Ottoman Turks are sovereignty from the Venizels in 1573. In 19th, the 19th century Britain is continuing to focus on the removal of Britain.
Cyprus was a independent republic in 1959.
Switzerland and ethnic conflicts have sparked the unity of the Turkish and Greek communities, and the establishment of an interim Turkish administration.
Talks between the two communities and the Greek side of the Turkish side have been delayed for years in talks with the Turkish side of Denktasides.
In these talks, Turkish Cypriots demanded a reunification union, while the Greek Cypriots opposed the request, and talks have ended without any consequences.
In 1974, officers from Greece have created a military couple and removed the management of the island "(Rumica) to remove the mandate of the Greek Cypriot National Assembly -- with 37 per cent of its territory.
The UN monitoring talks began in 1976, and has continued since then.
However, the EU 'Copenhagen summit in 2002 is an enormous functioning of a participation in the Greek Cypriot side to accept possible developments.

At the beginning of the country, the visitors were important, especially in the visitors who were sent abroad, but the industry needs more important.
Tirana and Durres are increasing with the highway connecting two cities.
However, there is no stability in investments and Albania is not only from Tirana.
The poverty needs to invest in foreign sectors.
The most important reason for foreign investments is that Albania has won the international arena (unfair).
Members of Albania have returned to their countries as a more positive assessment.
However, the country must be done to show serious progress.
At the same time, international investors in the country are expected to increase in operations.
A growth of 5-6 per cent is a smaller rise.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU shows that Albania is in the right way.
If the political life is still a climate of life, risks are not the most difficult.
The Socialists, such as smaller parties, are published their own newspapers, such as their own newspaper.
This newspapers are doing nothing, but this is not a problem.
The Socialist party leader Edi Rama has been fighting between Berisha and Berisha, and former Socialist leader Fatmir Nano has offered to form his own party in a party, but the citizens in the street think that such politics are now facing.
Meanwhile, the two major parties in the country have reached an agreement on electoral rules to implement the local elections, and this is the way to boycott the ruling scandal.

There is a smaller team of Berisha.
"We know that we can be able to see this as a clear way," Youth and energy Public Protection Minister Lulzim Seza.
The traffic in the office of Babia shows that Albania will improve the transportation of transportation. It will be easily easy to go to a country in the framework, and the country will increase strategic policy.
The international investments are very clear, but Montenegro is also in the way for tourist investments.
The highway, which will begin in Dubrovnik, will change the country in the southeastern city of Sarac.
This project is crucial for Albania to benefit from its long-term tourist potential.
The services sector, particularly restaurants and hotels in Albania, is submitted to the country 'intelligence mechanisms.
The country is a lot of monuments and abroad.
The country will affect tourists' readiness and visitors.
Albania is a major country in terms of natural resources such as oil, gas, gas, biometric and hydropower potential.
So far, the most important step was Berisha "Albania".
Although the plan is not complete, the goal of the plan is to submit concrete conditions for investors, such as agriculture, agriculture, imports, and the need for strategic investments, such as energy.
As part of the Plan, the ministries will represent their assets, and then then revealed them as a long-term term.
In addition, we will be able to get a stage of a branch, if the state has a long-term development strategy.
Meanwhile, many major details are expected to be elected, and how to be implemented by investment commitments, such as a punishing punishment.
The plan will be given the economy minister, Young Ruli, who is the basis for implementation.
Although the plan is a smaller idea: The political consequences that will be easy if the assets are not able to fulfil their assets and the investors are expected to meet the expectations.
The government is preparing to submit a huge tax and technologies to attract foreign investors.
Public commercial procurement measures have been removed from eight to eight years.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha has promised that the process will be further.
Among other measures aimed at reducing the state, tax hikes and general spending, the government was satisfied with the government.
Soking citizens now have a declaration of corruption, this is a lot of consumption.
This is a very positive development for foreigners.
The main ministers of Albania have also shown developments in their countries in their countries.
The Albanian ministers are positive.
Berisha, meanwhile, was to consult on issues such as former US Security Minister Tomir Rexhepi, security issues such as organised crime and corruption, as well as NATO partnership and investment.

According to a survey on the security of Eurobarometer in April, more than two-thirds of the Bulgarian people are rising the risk of disease or disease, according to a survey on the security of the Bulgarian people.
According to Anna-Maria Borisova, the country &aposs new health minister, the poor management and professionalism system is needed for reforms.
"I want to provide high health services in every country," Borisova said after his resignation on 22 April. "I need to be the best possible case in any hospital in Bulgaria."
The health sector was removed at the end of the 1990s.
A new model of funding and education system has been replaced in the communist era, and the economic, legal and financial independence was granted.
Doctors and hospitals have become independent from the new National Information Fund (NHIF), which is created by the payment agency.
However, other amendments that will help improve the efficiency and quality have stalled due to lack of political will.
"We will focus on the reform, because it is a delay in the history," Borisova told reporters in Sofia.
At the same time, he stressed, the decisions will be taken, but after the meeting and preparations.
Borisova cited the implementation of standards for sector employees and a "national health care" for the country 'health care system.
Borisova, a teacher at the English and Sofia Fashion, was resigned in March to resignate Bozidar Nanev, who resigned on the procurement of the festival Tamir in late last year.

Nanev warned that the economic crisis would have to cover spending in the sector, as well as the disappointment of several hospitals operating in the region.
Borisova said the number of hospitals in Bulgaria increased from 293 to 14,000 in the past nine years.
This means that there are 3,000 hospitals in Bulgaria at the EU average of 3 people, but about 4.6 hospitals.
"This is a large increase of all hospitals, and our resources are not changed, but we have not changed the level of hospitals," he said, adding that some of the current hospitals would not be closed.
Another key problem in the professionalism sector.
"It is not a doctor for Bulgaria," the Sofia News Agency quoted Borisova as saying. "The number of people are still aware of the real need for Bulgaria.
This is a disaster. "
A Sofia doctor told SETimes that low wages, health care status and the poor management of health care are are only the problems in the health sector.
"The head of the system [the] was designed," he said, referring to the secret circumstances.

Another of the law, however, envisions the removal of workers in the World War II and the mechanisms to be extradited to them.
The Hungarian parties in Serbia say the measure is not impossible because it is affected by any crime or any crime.
"If the law refuses to reveal the principles of national responsibility, the constitution is disappointed and we don 'not in line with the principles of European principles," said Izvan Pastor, the head of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians, a member of the ruling coalition in Serbia.
Pastor said the law would urge the implementation of the constitution.
Meanwhile, Semjen urged Serbia to change "in the way it is unacceptable", which is not acceptable, "and urges the Hungarian community to ensure that it would be able to exercise.
About 350,000 Hungarians live in Serbia.
Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic told SETimes that Serbia is against the communist crime, but it does not want to see some of the opponents who opposes during the World War II.
Celic also noted that Serbian authorities would try to convince the Hungarian community that the law has not been involved in the principles of organised crime, but that the current parliament does not have the right to change the law.
Nenad Canak, leader of the Vojvodina Social Democratic Union of Vojvodina, was more clear.
"We are doing the election between the EU and our citizens to participate in our citizens, and we will think that we are very happy.
"This is a EU and we will think that we do not want to participate," he said.
Sarkozy Vukojevic, director of the EurActiv website, told SETimes on October 12th that Serbia will likely be nominated from the European Commission.
"But in December, all members must accept it.
At this point, Hungary can be able to make Serbia closer, and the candidate countries have made evidence that their progress towards EU membership is obvious due to disputes with EU member states, "he said.
The move was completely completed due to a number of monasteries between Serbs and Hungarians in the town of July.
Darko Group, a NGO coalition led by Civkovic, believes that such incidents are low.
"Earlier the election and events in the region have increased.
"The incidents in July should not be increased, but the ethnic communities who live in which they will have a more comprehensive movement for the reasons."

Bulgaria and other 19 EU member states have been easy to buy a loan to four years ago, according to a new survey released by Eurostat on Monday (October 3rd).
However, the survey shows that the economic crisis has been sparked by such companies in the 20 countries, which have been due to the results of credit applications between 2007 and 2010, the surveillance surveillance showed that the loan is increasingly difficult for businesses.
Swiss in all countries that have been rejected as general, the KOMEs' demands have increased by at least or lower than in the survey.
According to Eurostat, the biggest increase in the successful credit application was in Bulgaria, including 36% in 2007, to 36% in 2010.
The Balkan country is the highest in the support of the loan application for 20 countries participating in the survey.
Furthermore, successful credit applications have dropped from 87% to 43% in Bulgaria, including 87% in 2007, from 87% in 2007.

However, Tomislav Georgiev &apos
The businessman also received a loan in the end of the loan, but it is not easy.
"The details were in five times.
At the beginning of the start, Talat was removed, but after the end, we were approved, "he said." Of course, we have received about seven months to find a compromise. "
However, Ivan Midanov, a initiative in the Black Sea coastal coastal coastal coastal resort, has no chance.
Since the start of the island, it was asked to build a hotel and sell the investment application.
Initiative said the banks are rising the project.
"The compromise was better, because the ratification was approved because the loan will be able to pay the loan in the past decades," he told SETimes.
Georgi Angelov, from the Employment Society Institute (OSI) in Sofia, said Bulgaria has removed a long-term economic growth, and that the period has caused a concrete increase in the sale of market sales.
"Therefore, the financial situation is very easy to buy the loan for both companies and companies' growth," Angelov said.
In the crisis, however, the economic situation has started stalled, and the SMEs have agreed to find new financial resources.
Angelov told SETimes that the companies are preparing such a risk.
"Many believe that the long-term projects financed by the long-term loans, which can be able to reach an unlimited bank loan, and this is not a reason," Angelov said.
"Furthermore, many Bulgarian companies are on the coastal part of the economy, which revenues only a part of the revenues," Angelov added.
This is not important in the previous survey of the crisis, but the bankruptcy dealing with the bank 'findings and the bank' findings have already launched the questionnaire.
"In the long time, the transport will start to change operational practices, and companies will have to start closing to more consumption in financing, restructuring and new shares," Angelov said.

Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis dismissed 19 per cent to 19 per cent, as part of the government efforts to bring Greek economy into European standards.
The amendment took effect on 1 April.

The government has dropped from 35 per cent to 25 per cent of businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises from 25 per cent to 25 per cent, but businesses oppose violence.
Both opposition and Alogoskoufis criticised the movement of its own New Democracy party.
Alogoskoufis acknowledged that this could have a long-term effect on the economy, but argues it is no other option.
Greece is currently under pressure from the Union, which is currently the highest budget deficit of the EU, is currently under pressure to remove 3 per cent of GDP by the end of 2006.

Ashdown
Paddy Ashdown warned on Tuesday that Bosnia and Herzegovina politicians should resume the police force to move forward towards the EU.
If they do not do so, other countries in the region will stop, Ashdown added.
(Office of the High Representative -- 19 / 04 / 05; Fena, Hurriyet - 19 / 04 / 05)
"Police reform continues to be the last major obstacle that BiH needs to start negotiations on its own Stabilisation and Association Agreement," High Representative Paddy Ashdown said. [OHR]
High Representative Paddy Ashdown urged politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Tuesday (April 19th) to reach a compromise on police reform, a key precondition for the country must meet in the EU integration process.
"Police reform continues to be the most important that BiH must start negotiations on its own Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)," Ashdown said at a meeting with leaders of the Federation of BiH.
The meeting was held on April 24th, the first day of the political talks on reunification of the country.
A advisory mission to the European Commission (EC) will arrive in BiH in mid-May to assess the progress made in meeting 16 requirements that BiH has made in a feasibility study.
A positive assessment will allow the SAA talks, the first step towards eventual EU membership.
According to Ashdown, "we can reach a constructive co-operation" with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, the agenda has been resolved.
He added, however, that the SAA talks could be closed after all preconditions are met.
BiH leaders must reach an official agreement on police reform, "he said, adding that BiH will be responsible for delay over the EU bid".
Among the requirements for Brussels' police reform, the police law and the state budget will be given special authority in the state level, ensuring political intervention and protecting the protection of the law on the functional criteria.
"If the negotiations will be successful, this talks will bring BiH to a major climate system that will win the fight against organised crime," Ashdown said. "If we will be able to stop BiH, we will not stay in Europe.
"This is not a decision that we will be able to reach an agreement on us."
As the EC issued a positive feasibility study for Serbia-Montenegro last week, British diplomat said that this is a clear sign that the past is not a priority for BiH 'neighbours.
"The main political figures in BiH -- both the ruling and the opposition -- are now willing to prove that this goal is to achieve this target, and they have the opportunity to prove BiH to prove it," Ashdown said.
Police reform was among the issues of EUPM Commissioner Kevin Clay 'head of the Brcko Policy Police Service in BiH on Tuesday, Milenko Milicevic and members of the EUPM.
"The reasons for police reform in BiH," Clay said. "The current security forces in BiH are not functioning, and there is no strong effect of various political parties."
If the country wants to start EU membership talks, the EUPM chief said. "BiH politicians will elect two seats in front of the police force -- or will be closed to the European door," the EUPM chief said.

Dutch Contact Group Appeals for Turkey 'EU accession talks
A number of Dutch advisory group suggested that Turkey should start EU accession talks within two years, but urged Ankara to resume human rights problems.
(EurActiv, International Herald Tribune - 26 / 08 / 04)
Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balenne, who was speaking to the European Parliament last month, said the Council of Europe will start accession talks with Turkey if Ankara has fulfilled political criteria. [AFP]
A former Dutch advisory group stressed that the 25-nation bloc is in Islam, and suggested that Turkey &aposs EU accession talks have launched in two years.
"A Muslim country can be a new country to accept the EU, but this is not different," the Netherlands International Committee (AIT) said in a report on Wednesday (August 25th).
The 30-page paper released only four months before EU member states decided to decide whether to start accession talks with Turkey.
The Dutch government, which took over the six-month rotating EU presidency in July, took over the issue as priority.
In a speech to the European Parliament last month, Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balenne told the European Commission that "Turkey will start negotiations with Turkey if the Copenhagen political criteria for membership will meet in December."
The AIT, which praised Turkey &aposs efforts in the past few years, stressed the need for full implementation of new democratic laws.
The report also noted that human rights violations, especially in penalties, are facing.
"Turkey can be a member of the EU and negotiations should be launched, but we must focus on more human rights," Ben Kynen, deputy head of the European Integration Committee for European Integration, said on Wednesday. "Now the Turkish government is continuing to continue its reform process."
The AIAT has expressed concern about the lack of restrictions on women 'rights and freedom of expression, and said that such problems could be a obstacle to the EU accession process.
"Women have a major lack of progress in human rights," the International Herald Tribune, a member of a human rights expert and advisory representative, said the International Herald Tribune. "There is still a huge progress, but concerns about the continuation of progress."
A group of recommendations to start accession talks in Turkey for 24 months said that the process could start soon if Ankara continues to implement democratic reforms.
However, the report cautioned that a final date for EU accession is under way.
"The accession should not be considered a date, because this will have to cause a compromise on a complete preparation for a strong preparation for the structure and political force," the report said.
The AIAT government and parliament are consulting on foreign policy issues, including human rights, peace and security, development and European participation.

As part of a general judicial reform package aimed at meeting the EU criteria, the law enforcement, trade, business and consumption disputes will not be implemented, but will not be implemented, penalties, penalties and intelligence issues.
The compromise, an alternative to the case, is a potential to increase the level of interest in the judiciary and increase efficiency.
Among other countries that have been implemented, smaller and medium-sized enterprises are the first group to see this approach.
The agreement helps a third entity to accept a acceptable solution.
The protocol is completed with a bilateral agreement between the two sides.
The salary for this service is set by a list of pre-preparations.
Although the West is a lawsuit, it could be able to have another colleague.

Police on Saturday (January 14th) and two border cross-border crossings with Serbia, Merkel / Merkel and Dushi Bajraja / Bela Zemlja were used to protest protests in the villages of Belgija.
He said the government does not adopt its decision to implement full political, economic and trade co-operation against Serbia, but the opposition "Vetevendosje" (Kildin ") organised the demonstration.
The move said some demonstrators were in the area of Pocijevo, near Merkel / Merdare.
A Kosovo TV reported that a police spokesperson was detained and eight police officers were injured.
The move noted that Vetvendosje leader Colin Kurti was also part of the assination, and that he has been implemented before he returned to the protest.
Vetevendosje accused Prime Minister Hashim Thaci "the government of the Republic of Kosovo and characterised the agreements" to stop Kosovo in front of Serbia, "Haradinaj said, adding that the protection of local production is protected.
Everyone of the workers are not in the north of the country, which has been unacceptable since the summer.
He told reporters on Saturday that he would not change the plans of security measures, while reiterating that the protests would not be changed, but also reiterated that Serbian goods are not seeking to enter Kosovo.
He was stopped by police protection at about 400-hour stage and accused police of failing to block the movement of people.
The interior ministry announced that the ministry will fulfil its mandate as part of any obstacle.
"The right to protest some citizens and tolerance will not be allowed to use the free movement of citizens and goods in the Republic of Kosovo," the ministry said.
The ministry emphasised that Kosovo Police will show "tolerance" against the law enforcement of the laws.
Tai, who does not leave Vetevendosje or protesters, told his cabinet on Wednesday that he should not recognise Kosovo Constitution and law as full respect.
"The perspective of the Kosovo state is not in the barricades," he said.
Kosovo President Atiff Jahjaga said he was not "convinced" the possibility of measures that can be done in the country institutions ".
"As such as any incidents, I am convinced that the president is facing actions against human and goods," Jahaga said.
France, Germany, Italy and Britain have urged Vetvendosje to avoid any violence or disappointed Kosovo Police personnel.
"These actions will not only be illegal, but also increase tensions in Kosovo and will affect the image of Kosovo abroad," he said in a statement.
EULEX and KFOR are confident that the Kosovo Police will "show any provocation and professionalism", the diplomats stressed, stressing that "the plan would be responsible for the Vetvendosje", which would lead to consequences. "
The EU Special Representative for Kosovo Ferno Gordan warns that any actions to eliminate obstacles are the risk of improving progress so far.
"I urge us to stop such actions to obtain freedom, because such actions will not be able to cause the European agenda," he said in a statement.
The foreign ministry has supported Albania, but also issued a statement saying that some Albanians in Kosovo and Albania have called for "sovereignty" to close border crossings with Serbia ".
Nevertheless, a highway was stopped by police at the Morine border crossings with Kosovo on Saturday.
While the other political parties in Kosovo have not supported the plan, various NGOs, companies and unions are divided.
Kosovo political commentator Belul Beaj, who is a student at University, told SETimes that the closure of border crossings could be "impossible", but that Vetvendosje will not be invited without the consequences of political results. "
High retail prices and state interventions rose by Serbian consumers
The state intervention has dropped some concerns over some concerns in Serbia, including salaries in the region.
By Katica Djurovic and Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 14 / 01 / 12
Some economists say the lack of competitiveness has increased prices in Serbia. [Reuters]
A protocol aimed at reducing food prices -- at least 10% to 10%.
However, the intervention aims to protest protests by the Community Union, which warns that it would lead to the closure of several small and medium-sized enterprises.
The institution, which will take effect this month and is due to take effect on July 1st, has dropped to 30% on some concerns.
Serbia has one of the lowest salaries in Southeast Europe, and citizens spend their salaries at the average.
Authorities hope that the reduction of diseases would increase and allow people to buy more.
"No one is unhappy that the administrative measures should be taken to protest, but there is no other mechanisms to establish the market, which reflects the high competitiveness," said Agriculture and Trade Minister Dusan Petrovic.
Some analysts warn that the arrangement will produce long-term results.
"In Serbia, there is a lot of expenditures, because production is low," Marica Vukovic, director of the Beta News Agency, told SETimes.
"If we will be able to see agriculture products, it is more expensive than Europe because all countries are lower than the state subsidies. [The agriculture] budget in Serbia is more expensive to protect the risk of the public, while the agriculture budget is lower than in other countries," he said.
The main reason for the adoption of the arrangement is the approach of the election period, Vukovic says.
Serbia must hold general elections in May.
Vukovic also expects the arrangement to give significant results.
"The austerity in the Hane budget will be sold in major families in the families of the large amounts, water, water and injuries," he said.
Daniel Busatlija, a economist of the Economic Institute in Belgrade, is expected to be a major outcome.
"In Serbia, food has been expensive because of the phenomenon on imports.
In this area, only a few companies are operating in the field, and they are also focusing on some customs commissioners of European products.
This means that imports will not be able to realise the prices of imports, and this money is why Serbia is, "he said.
The average salaries in Southeast Europe. [File]
The average salary in Serbia is about 376 euros and inflation rate is 8.1%.
The unemployment rate is about 20%.
In Southeast Europe, the average average salary in Macedonia is lower than Serbia.
The average salary in Slovenia is 975 euros and 715 euros in Croatia.
"Our products in Marketing are affected by the price of prices in our products, the gold category, purchase and transportation, electricity," Slobodan Radoski told SETimes.
Russia is serving as director of the Special Group in Delta Group, which serves as Maxxi and Conpo retail stations in Southeast Europe.
Earlier this month, the prices have been spent about 10% from Podgorica and Skopje, with a retail station in Serbia.
The large prices in the region have changed between 70 euros and 80 euros per cent, while consumers in the Serbian market received 85 euros to 90 euros.
The Movement for Commercial Protection says that all Serbian commercial accounts have decided to decide on a very comprehensive level due to insufficient control.
"Everyone seems to be developed.
Therefore, the same perspective in Belgrade can be different in a smaller car in the central part of Serbia, "he said.
According to Bogavljevic, the purchase has been reduced, the price of prices and reduced prices to boost consumer consumption and raise prices.
However, he added, prices in Serbia have increased.
Bogavljevic says the consequence of the overall growth rate is the lack of competitiveness.
The development of new methods in the country is more competitiveness, low prices and lower prices.
"This is why we are able to pay the retail of the retail that will be able to provide high profits from competitiveness," Dragan Milicevic, an analyst of the retail restaurants in Serbia, told SETimes.
Public prices are unhappy, and many are willing to raise the way to find more efficient prices.
"I am hiding in the Romanian town of Disojevic, as well as to buy electronic, gasoline, mountains and circumstances.
"I will continue to go to Romania if the retail retail retail stations in Romania are more cheaper and cheaper products come to Serbia, or by reducing local currency prices."

Now the party is preparing to meet the president.

The registration process of presidential candidates in Turkey began on Monday (April 16th) and will continue until 25 April.
As the head of the State Assembly was elected by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, many of the political analysts expect a candidate for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
All observers are over Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Many will have to leave the AKP as a possible candidate, while the party will have to leave the party before the parliamentary elections, it will weaken the AKP as a potential.
The AKP was passed in 1998 for the allegations of Turkish constitutional principles, and now the Islamist-rotating Party of Islamic Regulations.
Sezer, who served as president of the constitutional court, said his party was closely closed to "the principles of the republic".
In 2001, Erdogan formed the new party as a conservative party in the remarks of the Christian Democratic Party in Western Europe.
Since its ruling, the AKP has repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly reiterated the start of accession talks with the EU.
At the same time, Erdogan has been criticised by some of the government and criticised by criticising the law on the weapons of public employees, and for example, as well as attempts to remove public employees.
They argue that such movements are proud that the AKP is a proud of the former Islamist community.
The party has charged that political officials to Islam are trying to change the political culture of Turkey, as well as to bring high-level managers in the system.
"The dangerous threat has not changed the target of the state to change the basic character," Sezer told parliament at the first day of the year. "The amendment of the constitution is cautioning the political level of reconciliation, ensuring the political level and the rising threat to social tensions."
At the time, the AKP is prepared to discuss both the government and the presidency, it has become more important.
Sezer said last week that the Turkish Republic has "not faced a serious threat" since it was founded by the Republic of Turkey.
"democratic and structural structures, as well as protection of the state," he said, adding that "the state is the right and responsibility".
Chief of the Turkish Army Chief of Staff, Jakup Albert, said the military would be ready to intervene if Turkey is threats.
"How do you think they need to reunify the opportunity?
How do you see the state 'highest positions?
What is the right to see the basic principles of the Republic?
If there is no response to these questions, there is no Islamic threats in Turkey and should be taken into any measures against this threat. "
More than thousands of people gathered in Ankara at the weekend, accusing Erdogan 'possible candidacy.
Erdogan rejected criticism.
During his visit to the United States last October, the prime minister said the threat against the Turkish Cypriots is not the current and that the debate is not impossible.
Erdogan urged authorities in the country to survive statements that would cause unnecessary tensions.
Parliament will begin its next president on 26 April or 3 May.
More than four hours will be held.

SETimes: What is the role of the Culture?
Elizabeta Canadia-Milevska: Our cultural heritage in Macedonia is a lot of connections between us and the rest of Europe and the world.
For the first time since Macedonia independence, the cultural development of the state is in the centre of the state and is becoming a job.
This government has been charged with an example of foreign policy, for example of implementation in the past.
Earlier, more than 65m euros is a basic fundamental funding for Macedonia.
A new archaeological museum in Skopje is proving to prove a new archaeological museum, which will be exhibited in May 2011, has to build a new training completion of a new education complex, which will be completed in May 2011.
In the past three years, we revealed that 5,000 archaeological hospitals, including Stock, Armenia, Isma-Mark and Vrarski.
I believe that the culture should be a major part of the EU integration process.
The latest EC report released two weeks ago praised Macedonia for progress in culture.
SETimes: Do you see the importance of the culture 'connections between Macedonia and other Balkan countries?
Canadika-Milevska: I am satisfied with co-operation with countries in the region.
We signed agreements on all countries in the region, institutions and international relations.
Governments are not a common consensus, while cultural institutions have repeatedly stalled.
For example, the prominent Macedonian architecture and theatre director Milco Mancevski and Slobodan Malkovski -- are working with Greece and.
In Croatia, we have provided a comprehensive project, including exhibitions at the 140 artists' Art Museum.
We have an agreement on cultural co-operation in Macedonia, Slovenia and Austrian member states, such as Slovenia and Austria.
We have signed an agreement with Estonia in 2010, such as the European Cultural City in 2011, as we do with Turkey.
Several complaints have been made by all sides.
SETimes: How do you have a cultural policy of Macedonia?
Canadika-Milevska: Macedonia has a strategy that can be recognised as a clear cultural policy and protection and recognition.
We are operating in all areas such as musicians, theatre, musicians, museums, musicians, international promotions, international recognition and business, as well as the local cultural development of culture.
Cultural, political and economic performance can be seen as a major sector for the economy.
The culture has a significant economic deficit, which is not managing and how it has been managed.
We are also interested in developing cultural tourism.
SETimes: How do you face challenges such as you?
Canada Milevska: The discrimination on Macedonian cultural heritage is a key problem.
We continue to work closely with the laws and provisions of the interior ministry, and we continue to work closely with the law and prevent such crimes.
One of the most important archaeological scenarios is being taken through a lack of and fraud.
For example, there is a national institution in Stock, for example, and now there is a services that protects it.
The Culture is a chance to do so because it is a movement.
Both cultural event is an unprecise for us, as well as the success of the country.
SETimes: How do you share a certain success of a Nicosia difference?
Canadika-Milevska: The status of Arts is changed.
"We are successful in the efforts of the artists' efforts to create the scandal, and we are successful in a better assessment.
First, artists were invited to the project.
We have the highest level, and people in Macedonia are now ready to work together.
This approach could also be removed by others in protecting regional artists.

"I am completely satisfied with the circumstances of Stadar, but it is completely unhappy," he said, urging the organisation to "build projects" and not to stay in any way.
One of the most concerned projects is the pipeline, which has been replaced in the weeks and is a 30km pipeline that has replaced its new airport with Athens' new airport.
Although more than a million visitors were expected in August, both projects are considered critical.
"We will need to make a major effort to intervene," said Gianna Angelopoulos-Dasoulos, head of the 2004 Athens Olympics Committee for Organised Crime. "But we have not been able to come to these challenges," he added.
And everything is possible to prevent any incidents during the Games, Rogge said.

Tadic, meanwhile, emphasised that co-operation with the ICTY is a precondition for political stability in Serbia and that it would be "the main image".
Draskovic warned that the door for EU and NATO membership would be closed without extradition to The Hague.
If they fulfil their obligations, Serbia is high in the Partnership for Peace programme, he said.
Draskovic noted that the problem of war crimes suspects is the obstacle to Serbia, which is among European countries.

With NATO peacekeeping forces take over control of the controversial border crossings, the crisis in the north of Kosovo has been resolved.
However, experts say, the long-term problems are continued and Belgrade and Pristina are not strong to reach an agreement.
In an interview with the German media last week, KFOR commander said the lack of the rule of law is a factor that is contributing to the crisis in the north of Kosovo.
The ethnic Albanians, as well as many as Serbs, are allowed to continue liberalisation in the region.
"It is important to protect these structures, so that it is important to protect these structures.
"They have the right to do in the north today," he said. "The armed forces have the right to do in the north of the armed forces to control the barricades, protect barricades, and those who have been hiding in the barricades.
In addition, the peacekepers in the north have taken a lot of incidents. "
Although representatives of Belgrade sent a deal with KFOR, the removal of peacekepers and the opening of the free movement of free movement, analysts say the accord is only a provisional measure that does not affect greater problems.
"The region can be able to improve the political problem in the north, but there is no solution to the political problem," political analyst Fatmir Sadiku told SETimes.
Analysts say a long-term solution could be achieved only through a dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.
"However, there is no challenge of dialogue and no one has the right to avoid this process," said Ramadan Ilaku, director of the KFOR Movement in Pristina. "However, dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina has not been done so far.
However, Belgrade and Pristina are selling to sell the efforts on the future of northern Kosovo, where the Serb population is a majority.
The Kosovo government is continuing to take part in the region, while the local Serb communities have said it would oppose such a plan and recognise Kosovo as an independent state.
According to Ilaku, the long-term position for the north is submitted to the Ahtisaari Plan.
He says the plan was proud of a sustainable solution, because Serbs in the southern part of Kosovo can live with them.
"This plan is successful in the integration and development of the Serb community in Southeast Europe, and the other municipalities that are accepted by the Strpce, Gracanica and the plan are considered a clear increase in the quality of life," he said.
Sadiku, meanwhile, is convinced that the north "will take place in the region, and that the rule of law" is being investigated and the fight against organised crime and criminal groups.
Both Serbia and Kosovo aim to meet the final EU membership, while Brussels urged both sides to return to the negotiating chapter.
"The EU stressed the need for resolving the dialogue and resolving problems that have been resolved without delay.
"The EU is seeking to see a fruitful progress on this issue," he said.
"We hope that there can be acceptable for all sides, a pragmatic and active solution will be as soon as possible," he added.

Kosovo Albanians have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly criticised Serbs, while Serbs continue to offer "broad autonomy".
Serbian Minister of Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said the talks could continue.
"We believe that the negotiations are not closed with the trouble report.
This is a very important phase, and that [former UN envoy] Martti Ahtisaari [is more successful, "he said.
Jeremic, meanwhile, has warned any unilateral movement of Kosovo leaders, warning that independence could be declared unilateral.
"The status of Kosovo and the international status should be guaranteed by any changes to the UN," the Serbian foreign minister said.

So far, 90% of the buildings in Istanbul are estimated that all buildings in the city need for a budget, while about 25-25-25 to 25 years are needed to strengthen all buildings.
Meanwhile, the plan aims to establish natural disasters, the first and medium-school institutions' restructuring, and the situation of intelligence programmes are on the agenda of the Higher education institutions.
Plan does not mean the need to protect historic and cultural heritage as the effects of the earthquake.

He believes the crisis in the eurozone will not affect Kosovo.
"Kosovo is based on financing of Germany and this is not a problem in financial stability," he said.
The incidents of the GEP Studies Institute, Russia Herina Puka, agrees that the incidents in Germany will be a prominent factors in Kosovo.
"We need to connect the eurozone crisis in Germany, so this will reflect a crisis in the region," he told SETimes.

Our country is worried, and it is not the only way that the country will continue to be made in the privatisation of the PTK (PTK), "he said.
He says the privatisation will increase these risks since it is expected to take place this year.
"This could be a serious threat of financial stability and relations with the IMF," he said.
Bosnia and Herzegovina warns that a financial crisis in countries such as Kosovo will be more effective.
"If such a crisis, the country does not reflect a more difficult economic situation in other developments -- unemployment and poverty -- a increase in inflation and poverty increase in prices," he said.
He says Kosovo is not stable trade relations with the EU, so that it will not affect the crisis in the eurozone.
"Kosovo is not a country of exports, but this is not a change in the value of the billion-euro, which would allow the country to facilitate trade in markets in the eurozone," he said.
However, it could affect donors from the country because of the European countries' financial situation.

Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said on Wednesday (January 19th) that a Croatian joint committee will be formed to discuss bilateral relations.
He stressed that disputes between Ljubljana and Zagreb should not bring relations between the two countries or Croatia 'EU bid.
Since Slovenia and Croatia declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, there have been a number of issues.
Piran Koku, the Icellor, has caused some border incidents and continues to be one of the most critical points in bilateral relations.
A small coup between Slovenia and southern Croatia is the issue of dispute.
The two countries signed an agreement on international organisations in 2001, but Croatia has not yet ratified it.
While in Slovenia, the two countries' joint partners are also discussing the Krsto nuclear power plant and the western Ljubljanska Bank 'debts with Croatian businesses.
"We have a number of problems with Croatia and Slovenia can solve only in the EU," Rupel said at a press conference in Zagreb on Wednesday. "Therefore, I think that Croatia will approve the EU as soon as possible."
Slovenia was the first former Yugoslav republic to join the bloc on 1 May 2004, with nine other Central and Eastern European countries.
Croatia, which is expected to start its EU membership talks in March, is expected to join in 2009.
The latest indictment of Croatian border police detained a Slovenian politics in September last year has caused a threat to Ljubljana that Zagreb would lead to its EU bid.
The move was removed later.
EU security chief Javier Solana, who urged both countries to resolve a solution through dialogue, said the closure of EU membership is open to all Balkan countries.

The obstacles in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) are facing various challenges as a slowdown of law enforcement rights, as well as full recognition of business needs.
Authorities proposed several strategy and project projects last month for unemployment.
The event, however, was organised by a mechanism that people who use the seat seats.
"These cases are a true example of the battle against politicians' obstacles," FBiH 'Association Secretary-General Besa Besija told SETimes.
The Republic of Republika Srpska (RS), which has no official figures for official obstacles -- has a total of 350,000 obstacles, including 250 in FBiH.
The unemployment rate between communities is around 85%.
The FBiH parliament passed the Constitution of Industry Regulations, Education and Intelligence, five years ago, a year ago.
In early 2010, parliament vowed to form a special phone for the law, which was held in April 2011.
Both the law and the law were passed in RS in 2005.
Since then, there were 1,000 obstacles.
However, such a law is not the current.
The law was part of the obligations that BiH has a country with the UN Information of Human Rights.
The law envisions that at least 39 employees of all public institutions and institutions by 2013, a number of obstacles to 16.
The average salary in FBiH, which is 423 euros in 2011, has been punished to 25% of the average salary in the average salary.
The two sides of BiH have allocated 52,000 euros in supporting the employment of the obstacles, and the entity governments have suggested that the census have been submitted for the year.
According to Besija, however, these actions are not yet made.
"We need to create a long-term atmosphere for employment," he said.
Several organisations, representing Index, have decided to provide their own members, to take measures with their own image.
The Libyan company, founded by the Sarajevo Studies and Development Association in 1996, is operating in the field of the Libyan company.
The company is only a member of its own members.
"We have split almost a few years, but we have been able to stop with foreign organisations and embassies," Libyan Director Jasenka Karajic told SETimes.
"The FBiH government has passed the law on obtaining obstacles for six years ago, and we will have more jobs in order to stop their own and its own interests.
However, if the law is passed, we have the good interest of authorities and foreign donations, "he added.
Mirza Jasarevic, a NGO of the Government and Support Centre, says the FBiH could be able to improve the restrictions in the country, which has been spent since the end of the armed conflict.
"Experts have a large part of the greatest category and a large part of the voters' selection," Jasarevic told SETimes.
Serbia-Montenegro Discuss NATO David

Serbia-Montenegro has two key issues in its Euro-Atlantic integration.
One is that the UN war crimes tribunal should not co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal and the indictees -- especially Bosnian Serb wartime leader Ratko Mladic.
The second is the case that the country has taken ten NATO countries due to its action in 1999.
The case was opened by the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said he would propose the Council of Ministers to reduce charges.
European Commission Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Giorrey Barack said the reduction of charges would increase the country to join the EU.
"It should be necessary to convince the past with the past," he said.
Belgrade has proposed the case, while NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer suggested that he was in his visit to Serbia-Montenegro on July 19th.
Officials in Brussels are positive.
Nevertheless, the Democratic Party of Serbia (DS), led by Serbian President Boris Tadic.
The DS argues that everything is possible to facilitate the EU and NATO membership in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme as possible.
"If we mean that such accusations will be removed, we should be able to see this goal, because it is not a precondition for the international community," the DS said in a statement.
However, the most effective party in the Serbian government -- led by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica (DSS) -- argues that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia must reduce charges against Serbia-Montenegro.
"We think that all cases should be done if they are part of the same problem," a DSS official said.
As expected, the Serbian Radical Party and the Socialists of Milosevic have criticised the initiative of Draskovic.
Political analysts warn that the removal of the charges is not the most important issue that Serbia-Montenegro 'hopes to join the PfP programme.
Experts note that the international community is arrested and co-operation with the UN tribunal.
It will also be a sign that NATO wants Serbia-Montenegro to join the Alliance.
Serbian media commentators say the charges will have to be reduced or reduced, because they will be able to open a system to be part of a system.

Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met with opposition leader Ali Ahmeti last week after a major political crisis.
The Democratic Union of Integration (DUI) was removed from Parliament in January, when the parliament did not comply with Badinter members in the process.
According to the indictment, the decisions on minorities have been taken, while at least two-thirds of the Macedonian minority members must vote.
The DUI has made a lack of political and political dialogue and affected the laws needed for EU and NATO membership.
Before the meeting, the United States encouraged NATO and the EU to discuss issues.
Following a coup, the dialogue continued.
Gruevski also discussed political issues over Ahtisaari and his opponents over six hours.
He said the government is a list of requirements, including a constitution that will be elected by Bush, and the law enforcement of members of the former National Liberation Army members to discuss the status and social problems.
Gruevski, however, resigned two proposals.
The prime minister said it would mean Macedonia to change the state structure.
"There is no example of such a government in the world," he said.
Gruevski has encouraged DUI to return to politics and asked the projects related to medical education, prosecutors and information society to support the government on the constitution and constitutional changes.
At the end of the meeting, he did not reach an agreement on preparing a list of laws.
A group of representatives of the two parties to submit a list will be established and will be part of the parliamentary assembly.
Members of the DUI delegation said there is no model for dialogue.
He said that the task groups should meet all issues, because the dialogue will not continue.
The meeting was also supported by representatives of the DUI as a precondition for the start of Gruevski, but also as a precondition for foreign embassies.
In a joint press release after the meeting of EU, NATO, NATO and OSCE missions, the US embassy said it is very important to build confidence between the parties.
"We are urging all parties to continue efforts and work on a compromise.
This is a requirement for the reform process and the state institutions, "the report said.
However, the DUI said it would expect "concrete results" before parliament.

The World media praised Belgrade efforts.
"The 2008 Eurovision championship in Belgrade will be repeatedly repeatedly seen as a precedent," IT-TASS said.
"Serbs use the chance to change Serbia today, a normal country in the Milosevic regime, which is a normal country," CNN said.
"Serbia and Belgrade have proved that it is part of Europe," the BBC said.
Most of the 3,500 journalists agree that the organisations are untrue.
Most expressed satisfaction with Belgrade Arena, where the competition was held and the two of the cities of Belgrade, Prosecutor and Danube were symbolised.

Syrian opposition groups in the southern province vowed a strong message at a conference in Ankara last week.
The group said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must resign and transfer his mandate to the president until the council is formed into a consensus to democracy.
Analysts say Turkey supports the forum, allowing "Information Conference in Syria", allowing the event to take place on its territory.
Nevertheless, Ankara continues to be the main position.
MP lawmakers and parliament spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Mehmet Yildiz said the ruling party will not be "disappointed".
"We cannot be able to talk about developments in Syria.
At the same time, we are more effective and clear about Syria after all elections.
A representative of the opposition Turkish Movement in Syria and participation in the forum, Ali Ozgur, told SETimes that Turkey is confident.
"We want Turkey to help us as a terrorist organisation, but not as a unique and friendly neighbourhood," he said.
The protesters in Syria are expected to help Turkey and removed the flag during the demonstrations, he added.
Syrian analysts from the Syrian Centre for Middle East Strategic Studies in Ankara were at the conference.
"We have given a clear message to the Syrian people to host the Anatolian forum. We have supported the opposition, and we are ready to support any diplomatic support," he said.
"This is a second step in Turkey &aposs position to Syria.
As the first step, Turkey called on the Assad regime to continue reforms, but did not find it. "
In this time, Turkey could not continue to support international sanctions against Syria.
This is a "big climate" in the regime.
Everything should be done to transform Syria into a secure democracy, he said at a conference in Ankara.
Meanwhile, leader of parliament &aposs Turkish-Syria Contact Group, Mehmet Sahin, has submitted a number of visitors.
Therefore, the conference in Turkey is concerned that the country could foster relations with Egypt.
"We cannot think that Syria will contribute to stability," he said.
"I have managed to manage this in Ankara for months," said Sahin, a representative of the Movement for Movement (MHP). "According to this, the Turkish policy should not be different from the Western world.
"The Middle East [of Syria] will become a destination from Afghanistan," he warned.
Syrian analyst Muharrem Ozkov, a Syrian analyst at the Ankara Centre for Asia Strategic Research, believes Turkey is not aware of the Syrian opposition.
"However, the real situation is that the opposition is in Syrian politics after the Anatolian forum," he argues, arguing that Turkey is trying to play a medical role.
Meanwhile, he added, "Ankara will not be able to support the opposition.

The murder of other students in Pristina, Muhamet Cakay, 19, was the last of several major events that have been killed by the Sami Frattini List in Kosovo, which has been prepared for a priority of violence in schools.
The problem has sparked controversial debate.
"This is a lack of security for students in schools and environmental facilities.
Therefore, it is a sign of the lack of evidence of education and security institutions, which started to achieve the census level, "he said.
Observers also supported the concerns of INPO in 2011: more than 210 people were announced in the first stage of 2011.
This is worse since 2010, when the police had a 37 minutes, 36 patients were discovered, 15 patients, 15 genocide and unprecedented injuries.
"The work in Kosovo shows a high risk of developing children because of violence, poverty and other factors," Experts from the UNICEF said.
In addition to interethnic violence, students have also made a statement by students' students.
Pristina, 18, says the teachers' circumstances have no reason for students, and that they were attacked by psychological attacks.
"Last month, one of the teachers did not think that one of the teachers can be able to get a lot," he said.
At the same time, a student was teaching a teacher, while teaching a teaching mobile phone, "he said.
Pristina writer Recep Tayyip Gashi acknowledged that teachers' teachers are being implemented, while some of the borders are limited.
"Several teachers, praising children, used [their] positions] as a way to protect their authority, but this is not the right, and this is not the right," Gashi said.
However, Gashi said, many are still facing war traffic and poverty, and that students can be difficult to solve these problems, because they do not want to solve these problems.
"Journalists say that there is difficult to find a good education, and they are doing the scenarios and are doing them to foster them," Gashi said.
Pristina teacher Agron Sweden acknowledged that students are difficult to create teaching teachers today because they are defined and very active.
"I am really reminded that the children have been implemented for a school, but this is 90%.
And it is not a complex, because they continue to be implemented today, and they are simply simply frushed for their lives, "he said.
In an effort to resolve this problem, the Kosovo Education Ministry said it is working together with schools and communities to prevent a recognition of physical stability and consequences.
However, the ministry said, families, schools, schools and society are not easy.
"I urge the parents and other institutions of the country to influence their children in schools, but also to avoid violence in schools and schools," Education Minister Rajza Buja told SETimes.

The amendments to the referendum were adopted after RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik 'controversial controversial debate with the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) -- the 83 seats in parliament.
The new law was adopted by six votes, with 16 votes.
Bosniak members of the RS parliament boycotted the vote, insisting that the bill was violated by the Dayton Peace Accords and the BiH Constitution.
The law allows Serbian entity to hold a referendum on national issues, but only a few technical issues such as the procedure and a referendum.
The law does not mean that the referendum can be held or any questions.
Dodik also threatened to call a referendum on RS 'independence, if the entity is under dangerous.
In recent months, the prime minister urged the RS parliament to decide on a referendum in December that High Representative Valentin Inzko rejected the decision of foreign judges and prosecutors working in Bosnian courts.
Dodik denied on Tuesday that the new Conference and the Civilian Public Authority has refused to facilitate the entity [from BiH] or violate the Dayton Accords.

Dodik argues that all sides should decide on such issues.
The law was approved, though the international community has warned that the referendum on such issues could make BiH more stable.
"Although the referendum is a basic mechanism in accordance with the requirements, it could be disappointed, and it could be disappointed by a political agenda," the US Embassy in Sarajevo said on Tuesday. "The United States will accept any referendum on the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina, sovereignty or territorial integrity."
The leaders of the Bosnian Serb parties, who supported Inzko 'law, warns that the referendum would be more easy to RS and the world communities.

Last year, the ruling VMRO-DPMNE has been broadcast, especially in 2000, while the coalition, established by the Social Democrats' priority.
One reason for this situation is a new mechanism of the number of political parties to more than 500.
As a result of the change, many of the small political groups have to enter the world.
Democratic League, the first political party in Macedonia after the end of the communist regime, joined the VMRO-DPMNE.
Marjan Gorcev, leader of the Agriculture Party, was a member of the VMRO-DPMNE, and former Prime Minister Ljubco Gruevski served as the agriculture minister in the government.
The DRIM party, founded by former President Dosta Dimitrovska, has returned to the party.
The eight parties were participated in the VMRO-DPMNE.
The small parties are not satisfied with this law on political parties.
Gjorge Marjanovic, former leader of the Democratic League of Democracy and actor, has demanded that the amendments to the Constitutional Court require a proposal.

Last month, the court initiated a procedure on the parties' justice ministry to sign an agreement on local units and complete the registration procedures within 45 days.
They voiced concern that the governments would violate the freedom of expression of political group, a constitution.
Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic League of Macedonia (SDSM) has a number of places because the last elections were killed.
Former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, leader of the party, was dismissed by the party, due to security.
Following this exports, a consortium was held for a new president.
Radmila Sekerinska, former prime minister for European integration, is the new leader of the SDSM.
The election of Sekerinska has made a completely new victory of the party leader.
Currently, the party has now been under the election, and this move is part of its efforts to ensure that Sekerinska is part of the party.
The ruling VMRO-DPMNE organised a conference and elected Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.
The situation in public opinion is in the 2002 parliamentary elections.
Today, the ruling party has already been pushing for a strong popular popularity in 2002, while the opposition is under way.
However, the ruling party, the VMRO-DPMNE, which won 23 per cent of citizens' confidence, is the ruling Social Democrats, the ruling party, which has won only 8 per cent of voters in 2002.
Political analysts say this is normal.
"The votes in the elections are very important [to] support for the party [the party] to resolve the economic problems," political analyst Merkel Biljulli said.
According to polls, 23 per cent of the population lives in the VMRO-DPMNE. [Getty Images]
He says the government will be slow as a slow loan if they meet commitments during the election campaign.
Although the SDSM is the same, the government did not fulfil the expectations of citizens to improve economic development and investments in 2002.
He will show that the Social Democrats will be effectively affected by the way to open political arrangements.
The latest development was the disappointment of the Union for Macedonia, which was established after the local elections in 2000.
Following his victory in 2002, Branko Crvenkovski supported the president in 2004.
The second largest ruling coalition in Macedonia, the Liberal Democrats, has come into a political restructuring process.
A party leader and former Skopje Mayor Risto Penov resigned from his post.
Following his resignation, former Defence Minister Jovan Manasievski took over the party administration.
Manasievski, who declared the council after the Constitutional Democrats, said his party faces dangerous threats against the SDSM.
Liberal Democrats are planning to become independent in the local elections expected in 2009.
Party: Agriculture Supported in Serbia
The main ethnic minority party in Serbia, Vojvodina, is urging the Hungarian Alliance to pressure on the international community to end an end to discrimination.

By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 27 / 01 / 04
According to the latest census, ethnic minorities will not have more than 30 per cent of the population of Serbia, but no representative in the new parliament.
The Danube Co-operation, which is the main ethnic minority in Serbia, has been created by the Bosniaks and Bosniaks' political parties, did not cover 5 per cent of the December 28th parliamentary elections.
The Serbian electoral law is unacceptable to international organisations, as the "optimistic discrimination", allowing all ethnic groups to protect minority rights.
The pro-European parties in parliament have pledged to change the law, saying it is not only the Serbs.
However, leader of the Vojvodina Hungarian Alliance (SVM), John Kuka, claims that lawmakers will not see as representatives of the real reason.
A reason for the election efforts is a reason for the parties.
Some refused to participate in the Co-operation, while Belgrade parties "met with their forces".
One of them is the Democratic Party of Democratic Party, which has two Bosniaks in support of supporters.
According to him, the December elections were made by Belgrade "with the" three steps ", when the ultranationalist Radical Party has made Serbia progress towards European integration.
He also voiced disappointment that the Constitutional Co-ordination has been shown by the poor results in central Serbia and Belgrade.
The party in the north of Vojvodina was second.
"The dissatisfaction and ideas will be affected in the region, as well as the ideas will be affected by the nationalist Vojvodina people," he said.
The SVM has sent a letter to international organisations, warning that the new political situation could lead to a negative impact on minorities.
Following the election victory, the SVM chief said the Radical Party is not enough to avoid a number of events in Vojvodina.
The SVM is urging the international community to take changes in the election law and to pressure on the proposed changes proposed by the Human Rights and Human Rights law.
The party believes the amendments will create a precondition for a multiethnic society.
"If Serbia accepts our culture, it is easy to facilitate that we are acceptable to Serbia," the letter said.

If the country can move forward towards EU membership, the only Balkan country in the process will be the only Balkan country, the EU principles are on the implementation of a police reform.

High Representative Paddy Ashdown told Republika Srpska lawmakers that police reform is the latest obstacle that Bosnia and Herzegovina must join the EU. [OHR]
Three days before the start of talks on police reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), High Representative Paddy Ashdown urged politicians in Republika Srpska on Thursday (April 21st) to resolve a compromise that would lead to an agreement.
"Police reform is the last reforms for Europe.
This is the last obstacle that RS and BiH must be able to join the European path, "he said.
He also cautioned that lawmakers have been more than four weeks to decide whether they want to go.
"There is two options: a future and a compromise future," Ashdown said. "The EU will be the only future that is offering BiH to join BiH, security and stability.
We can elect this option.
However, there is no option, we can elect it. "
The EU is expected to decide next month to allow BiH to start talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement on its first step towards eventual membership in the Union.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said that if BiH politicians reached a successful agreement on the EU principles of police, Brussels will be able to meet negotiations.
The three sides of the European Commission (EC) recommended by the state level: special police officers, but the political control of the local level is not the political control of police in local level, but the implementation of operations, and the removal of political intervention.
Ashdown said the main goal is to facilitate the police to fight organised crime.
While these sides are a clear way, they said, "there is a variety of ways to fulfil them, there is a broad consensus of compromise," said international envoy in BiH. "But there is many things that RS will win."
In RS, Ashdown emphasised that the police reform would be a step forward to the entity. He emphasised that such a agenda is not.
"It is not a plan to meet the constitutional reform issue," Ashdown said. "There is no attack against RS.
"There is no attempt to remove the scandals," he said, adding that this does not mean that the RS interior ministry does not mean.
Ashdown said that the extradition would bring better equipment to fight organised crime and benefits for the same job.
Among the results of a new survey in RS, Ashdown said that 79 per cent of the participants want BiH to join the EU, while 51 per cent supported the establishment of a state-level police force, which will bring the country into Europe.
"A total of 59 per cent of RS citizens are more effective than the politicians," he said, adding that the participants should "make further efforts in the fight against organised crime". According to 77 per cent of them, Ashdown added, the goal of the three EU nations.
Earlier, RS Prime Minister Pero Bujlovic told reporters that a compromise solution to the RS and BiH constitution is possible to change police reform.

The foreign ministers of the 27-nation bloc reiterated their support for Western Balkan countries' EU bid on Monday (July 27th), promising Albania 'application for membership as soon as possible.
Following talks in Brussels, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, who currently holds the rotating EU presidency, voiced hope that the EU would "make a new step towards the EU integration process".
He came after foreign ministers decided to send the European Commission (EC) to accept the official application for Iceland 'membership in the bloc.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday that the North Peace Agreement is a member of the European Economic Court of Europe, with about 300,000 people, adding that the country is in accordance with the EU laws.
However, Rehn added, the application for Iceland "will be charged with the rules", according to the rules.
Analysts believe that Brussels is likely to start accession talks with the Regjava next year if the EC has made a positive assessment on the application of Iceland.
Meanwhile, the country could join the bloc in the second half of 2011.
Several EU foreign ministers, including French Bernard Kouchner and Palestinian Alexander Sandzburg, also noted that Iceland was not impossible to face economic pressure after last year.
"The Ireland is a political reality to prevent the Balkan countries," Kouchner said at a press conference in Brussels.
Analysts warn that the new Ireland has made progress towards membership in the bloc could lead to a possible condemn between some EU prospects in the Balkans.
For example, the accession talks, which should be completed by the end of this year, have been blocked since December, due to the border dispute between Slovenia and Slovenia.
Macedonia is awaiting to start talks with Brussels since December 2005, as an official EU candidate country.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said on Monday that Athens' failure to start accession talks, would continue until the long-standing name dispute between the two countries will be resolved.
The stalemate of reforms was the obstacle to Bosnia and Herzegovina 'progress towards European integration.
Serbia must hand over former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to The Hague war crimes tribunal, as well as the challenges of Kosovo, as well as progress towards membership.
Montenegro submitted an official application for EU membership in December, and was invited to the EC in April.
At a visit to Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha, the same month presented his country for official application.

The ethnic minorities in Albania -- Greeks, Greeks, Serbs, Montenegro, Roma and Egyptians -- announced that the Albanian Constitutional Court will open the trial in Strasbourg after the Albanian Constitutional Court decided last week to send "competent" in the legal and influence of the population.
The court said there is no "competent" in order to avoid the population of Albania.
The union of the "comprehensive" of the official targets "in the south of Albania, including Greeks and Macedonians in the Mala Prespa region, is also on the dispute.
The Albanian court decision came in a case against several local judges, as well as the census of ethnic and religious identity in the October census, which was the main opponents of the census and the Alliance of Studies.
"A part of the Greek minority will require a percentage of per cent of the Greek minority, the document, and the government," said Albanian Justice Council Vice-President Kreshnik Spahiu.
The council is head of President Bamir Topi to prevent the judiciary.
They claim that the government has made it clear that the citizens' decision to declare the constitution, above Albania.
Some were sent to protests before the court decision in Strasbourg.
"The Macedonian minority in the Media region has no longer recognised them.
"We are demanding that Albanian authorities are not only in Mala Prespa, but for all Macedonians in Albania," he said.
"Greeks who recognised the country as minority in the southern part of the country will not see them as Greece.
This is not the right for Serbs and Montenegrin communities, because they are not recognised as a minority, "he added.
"The situation is very worried for us.
"Our politicians in all schools should not allow the minority media, the people and our country to allow us to return to this human plan," he said.
The court came only a few weeks after the court expressed protests on the remarks of the minorities' failure to improve the ethnic life of Albanian politicians.
The representative of the Greek minority Party for Human Rights Vane Dule condemned international community representatives in Tirana for dialogue and co-operation.
"The Constitutional court decision will continue in Strasbourg, because the Albanian constitution is disappointed by the 20th Madar, the rule of law will be suspended in Strasbourg," Dule said at a meeting of minority representatives in Cornica.
At the meeting, minority representatives signed a joint declaration that the census in October recognised the results of the census.
They said the census is under way and abuse, and that there is no transparency in the level of transparency.
"We have made positive response to our boycott of minority member, and there was no reason.
The census law is not aimed at creating the real number of minorities, but the statistics' statistics shows that the discrimination regime is continuing, "the report said.
In his support, it envisions more than 1,000 fees of Albanian intellectuals who have not been able to enter the polls.
In such moves, the Albanian state has continued to demonstrate its policy as a multiethnic country, which is a unique country with the previous conservative system, "he said.
They called for the government to initiate a real dialogue to change the current law and to respect the rights of international standards.
At the beginning of October, Albanian Foreign Minister Edmond Haxto met with Macedonian counterpart Nikola Popovski, saying he would reflect the census results and that Macedonia and all minorities will be allowed to see what they do.
"The implementation of the census is important for the implementation of the process to enhance human rights with the international and legal framework of the process," Macedonian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Borislav Stamov told SETimes.
He said that everything must meet international standards is "full and respect for full respect and respect of the law".
Bulgaria recognises Turkish territory for "Ukrainian Charter"
The Bulgarian parliament adopted a decision to condemn the immunity policy of the communist regime against ethnic Turks in 1980.
By Svetla Dimitrova for Southeast European Times in Sofia -- 18 / 01 / 12
The declaration was accepted with the support of 115 lawmakers participating in the session on January 11th. [Reuters]
About 22 years after the end of communism in Bulgaria, the country adopted a declaration last week to condemn its policies to impose ethnic Turks in the country in the second half of the 1980s.
In 1984, the "Ukrainian Charter", launched by Todor Jivkov 'assembly in 1984, ended in 1989 that more than 360 Turkish citizens were forced to asylum in neighbouring Turkey.
As part of this policy, the communist authorities in the country tried to change ethnic Bulgarian Muslims in the first time, and then to change the "traditional" Bulgarian figures.
The declaration, proposed by former Prime Minister Ivo Kostov, was proposed by former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov 'Party for Democrats (DSB), was accepted by 115 lawmakers who attended the session on January 11th, while three other lawmakers are optimistic.
"We condemned the implementation of the implementation of the constitution against Muslim minorities in the Republic of Bulgaria, including" the Committee said. "We are convinced that more than 360,000 Turkish citizens would be removed by a ethnic representative of the regime, which was implemented."
The statement calls for the country &aposs chief prosecutor and judiciary authorities to ensure the results of the cases against the campaign.
The DSB also insisted that the persecution of the crimes against ethnic Turks in one of the most recent history of Bulgaria has not been punished because of legal structures.
The document was described by Turkish experts and government in Ankara, as well as the rest.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry welcomed the decision to "modernise" during the period of the history of Bulgaria &aposs history ", urging Sofia to hand over the responsibility of the campaign and take steps to" ensure that the consequences of unresolved border crossings ".
The declaration was "an important step" in order to boost Bulgaria with the past and to boost its relations with Turkey, "said Balkan experts Mostar Kerlay, who serves as the International Strategic Research Centre (USAK) in Ankara.
"The move [provides] the opportunity for the creation of confidence in the two countries," he told SETimes. "Bulgaria has won a significant precedent by Turkey."
He also urged Bulgaria to "continue to continue in a sustainable sustainable sustainability", and believes the Balkan country "needs to take steps in education in Turkey".
Scientific, who served as Turkish ambassador to Tirana from 1985 to 1987, sparked the importance of the declaration.
"The decision of the Bulgarian National Assembly has nothing to condemn the adoption of the assembly." Bulgaria does not accept the "minority", which is in the international law and state, "he told SETimes.
"Bulgaria will be recognised and protected" minority rights "in the framework of international actions in the country, but it will be able to protect these decisions and autonomy from the Parliament."
Bulgarian Hellenic Committee Chairman Krassimir Canev told SETimes that the campaign in late 1980 was "deeply convinced", despite calls for the end of the 1980s ".
Bulgarian experts, however, see the move as a positive step.
Major Aleksandar Alexandrov, a professor at the New Bulgarian University in Sofia, said the move should create "credibility" on the members of the ethnic Turkish community in the country.
"Some of these people still remind the violence, while others are doing it," Alexandrov told SETimes.
Alexandrov told SETimes that Turkish Cypriots should now feel "more defendant" against reputation and psychologically ".
The Movement for Human Rights and Freedoms (HOP), including President Ahmet Dodik, has warned that Bulgaria could initiate a second "Ukrainian Charter" against ethnic Turks.
The party was established in 1990 to represent the interests of the ethnic Turkish minority.
In the past 20 years, all assembly represented in parliament and has been among the three coalition governments since 1992.
Following his reflection, former HR Vice-President Daniel, who has been sentenced to three years in prison in the 1980s, stressed that this should be acceptable ", but stressed that it should be acceptable".
"It is not a crime," he told SETimes on Tuesday, adding that "the campaign should be in the beginning of the 1990s," because of its opponents' immunity '.

Albanians, who have the majority of Kosovo, have different opinions that Kosovo will be able to see the final status of Kosovo.
Some are convinced that Kosovo will become a sovereignty in the international zone soon, while others are determined to see how it will happen.
However, everyone agree: The province will not remain under Serbian doctors.
"I do not know that it will be a independence, but I am confident that Kosovo is in the right direction," said Afrim Kabashi, a economist at the University of Pristina.
"I do not say they are unacceptable, but they need more closer to each other," he said.
Ard Mati, a student at the same school, is urging Kosovo people to resolve the status process.
"I think that the process is delay, but I think it is not a reason for us to see such progress in the past decades, but I think it is not a reason for worse and tolerance," he said.
According to Zadin Gashi, a journalist from the Zaman newspaper, the public 'Contact Group members have come to disputes and disputes.
Gashi, who believes these details are "the main factor of details and uncertainty", adding that there is no reason for optimism in the long term.
"The majority of Kosovo is returning to the EU.
I believe we will meet all criteria for membership in the coming years, "he said.
Bekim Ramadani, from Pristina University, believes the status process will be a result of the status process.
"We have come to the end of a long negotiation and transition process.
"The solution will be based on the political will of the citizens, and this is no doubt that Kosovo is independence," he said.
Ramadani is confident that Kosovo will be "a partnership state", which is recognised to represent minority communities and targets.
"A major decentralisation, minority rights, the constitutional reform system will ensure that the minorities in Kosovo, especially in the political structure of Kosovo Serbs," he said.
The status, however, will not be able to take all of the long-term problems that are expected to expect the province.
"Kosovo Serbs are facing real problems," Ramadani said.
"Corruption and organised crime could be the most dangerous for Kosovo," he said.
Bekim Ukaj believes democracy institutions, a good justice system and economic growth for Kosovo is a more future for Kosovo.
"These are needed for a good state," Ukaj said.
Some, especially the unemployment, are simply optimistic about the situation.
Swedish Movement says independence and economic development has been worried since 1999.
"They promised that we will have enough jobs and the integration process will help us work in Kosovo, not only abroad," he said.
He wants his family to live in the province and work abroad.
"We have five children, five children, and there are no reason to do so," he said.
Kosovo has been a member of the UN since 1999.
Serbia is recognised by the international community, although it is recognised by the Serb administration in the province.
The province is managed by UNMIK and the local Regional Protection Board, while the security of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) is on the ground.

Gashi said the EU funds that have been removed to border co-operation should be better.
"The aim of such projects is to bring the countries in the EU to the same level, but I think it is a long-term effect on the population in these projects," Gashi said.

Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, a country of about 3 billion euros and a 47 billion-euro debt, has implemented measures to boost spending and revenue.
The country is prepared to join the EU in 18 months, while the dangerous region has only a balance.
Central Bank Governor Zeljko Roglu said Croatia is "a very difficult year", and recommended that the budget is needed for 1.2 billion euros.
Last month, the new government proposed the implementation of a 6% tax on the telephone services, which was removed by the previous administration last October.
"We expect this budget to contribute to the budget of 40m euros," the government said last week.
The tax, expected this week, will be implemented by June 2013.
The new plan envisions tax removing from the SMS and MMS messages two years ago.
"This is an estimated 8m euros this year.
"There is no money for the state, but there will be no more than 20,000 jobs in the health sector," he said.
In addition, mobile phone operators have also met to the Constitutional Court and threats to reducing investment.
"Our government has made it clear that the government has decided to revive the actions of the previous mandate by the EU as one of the steps," VIP, one of the three mobile operators operating in Croatia, said in a statement.
Among other measures for public spending on public spending and state agencies, state employees will reduce mobile phone, mobile phone, airline, airport and business.
Authorities in the state institutions -- general secretary-general secrets, ministers' aspects -- will be reduced by a third.
Therefore, this will provide 130m euros to the state.
The government has also announced that the VAT is likely to boost economic growth, as well as to boost economic growth.
The bank also voiced support for the government efforts to improve the economy.
"We are awaiting for a year in order to promote the economic restructuring and encourage the government to dialogue with the government," Croatian Bank (HUB) spokesperson Ivana Prlenda told SETimes.
But Zeljko Lovicevic, a member of the Economic Institute of Economy and member of the Zagreb Economic Institute, told SETimes that these measures are only small steps.
"It is very difficult to spend spending for pensions, salaries and other revenues.
The state budget should be more than the officers' mobile phone funds, "he said.
The Croatian Authorities' Association warned that new taxes will be negative on the economy.
"It is very important for us to reduce the amount of taxes and the state administration.
Therefore, we welcome any reforms in the direction, because we are not the only way for the economy, "he said.
In each other, consumers think that the austerity measures are taking place.
"Tourists and other commercial taxes are all concerned about possible tax changes, and this is why the prices are rising.
In Croatia, I think there is no single job in Croatia, even if it does not think that this year will be worse.
They are interested on prices and taxes, and we know that we will pay. "
The government promised that the most defendant categories -- pensions and social assistance -- will not be "doctors" and that the tax on basic food fees will be imposed.
So far, it is now on.

At the same time, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said a successful election would open the way for the accession process.
"Albania must prove to prove that the Western democracy is unable to prove that it is unacceptable to Western democracy standards," said Embassy Andrey Glin, head of the monitoring committee, who was sent to the Council of Democracy and Human Rights (ODIHR).
"If the elections are not good, there will be many challenges."
However, the campaign has been shown by violence. Aleksandar Keka, 34, a member of the Christian Democratic Party of Christian Democratic Party, was killed in a car attack on June 18th.
So far, a controversial controversial controversial controversial controversial debate over the campaign campaign was killed and was killed in May.
The tension of tensions, which is expected to be expected, is high.
The results say the Democratic Party, which will serve as Prime Minister Sali Berisha and leader of the Democratic Party, will be able to manage the country for four years, or that the opposition Socialists, led by Edi Rama, will be able to power.

Greece seeks Schengen plans
Greece, which has been part of the Schengen Accords since 2000, has a chance of challenges and challenges.

Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey are still needed to join. [.gov]
While EU criteria are hoping to end visa restrictions for Western Balkan countries, Greece has a special position in the debate.
The country is the only country that has full membership in the Schengen Accords, and this is improving its role in the region.
Government officials say they are under way.
"Greek citizens of the Western Balkan countries are aware of the visa liberalisation of the visa liberalisation of visa liberalisation," Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said after talks with Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic in May.
However, public opinion has some details on the benefits of open borders, while some are concerned about economic immigration.
In recent years, Greece agreed to accept more than 2 million foreign workers.
Those workers have become part of the economy, but the country has changed its social and cultural heritage.
The Greeks, who repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly, have started to discuss such changes.
Furthermore, many are responsible for the increase in organised crime.
The critics argue that the reduction of border restrictions could be an obstacle to smuggling activities in the Balkans.
Although Greece is planning to eliminate visa restrictions, the economic movement is still under control.
For example, legal immigrants continue to be acceptable to children.
At the same time, authorities have also taken steps to make more difficult for visitors.
Last May, the country removed visa liberalisation for Serbs, and said it would submit other countries that have fulfilled the reforms needed under the Schengen plan.
Greece, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey are also visa.
Bulgarian, Croatian and Romanian citizens can travel to the country.
During talks with Jeremic, Bakoyannis described Serbia as a "unilateral part of the European family".
He said Greece is ready to accept a "many Serb friendly visitors to visit this summer".
Bakoyannis also supported the efforts to meet the Schengen criteria.
"We support the visa liberalisation process of Albania as a very important process for improving human relations between the Western Balkan countries," he said.
Macedonia, meanwhile, is waiting to see that the name dispute between neighbours has become a factor for years.
The European Commission confirmed that Skopje has met the conditions for visa-free travel.
In the past, Athens said its position on facilitating the visa regime would focus on the name issue.
However, Greek Ambassador Aleksandar Papadopoulos told A1 TV on May 11th that his country supports Macedonia "the Schengen List".
Papaconiou did not accept a certain precondition.
According to Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Bocevski, Greece has threatened to recognise Macedonia 'membership in NATO, but the process is likely to block the process.
Do you think a new moment in the Macedonia name talks?
During a meeting of the OSCE in Corfu, Greece and Macedonia will have a opportunity to discuss the foreign ministers, and UN envoy Matthew Nimetz says it is time to boost the process.
However, serious obstacles remain.

UN mediator Matthew Nimetz will visit Skopje and Athens from 9 July to 9 July to find a solution to the long-standing name dispute between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia.
The two sides continue in Ceneva this week, after the four-month negotiations.
Nimetz said the controversial discussions are prepared for talks in the coming months, and no new proposal was submitted.
However, he said, both countries have expressed support for "speech and a solution". "It is good time to boost the negotiation process."
Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said on Thursday (June 25th) that a new round is likely to be held.
Speaking at a press conference with Slovenian Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak, the OSCE ministers, who will be held in Corps, said the conference could create a opportunity to launch dialogue.
He said "a new symbolic and rural" is possible ".
Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski said the country was "encouraging the work to be positive".
Despite this optimism, however, the basic dispute continues.
Greece says a unacceptable "north" should be used and use the use of geography, such as "northern".
He argues, however, that the countries' "Republic of Macedonia" and that they should continue to do so.
"Our solution should not be made in the countries that have recognised our constitution, and the number of people are going to 20," said Macedonian negotiator Zoran Jolevski.
He added that any agreement should not allow any national identity to the Macedonian constitution.
Milososki rejected the idea of geographical idea.
The agreement, which is a result of the negotiating chapter, said Gruevski.
Greece, meanwhile, continues to convince its neighbourhood to continue to stop a stalemate and to show full commitment to resolving the problem.
Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said that authorities in Skopje are expecting "a different political approach to a solution to both sides".
Bakoyannis also confirmed that the Macedonian government has requested a meeting between Milosevic and Milosevic at the OSCE meeting.

During a meeting in late September, the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a decision to strengthen BiH institutions in the state parliament, urging BiH institutions to continue constitutional amendments to full progress towards EU membership.
The decision calls for the removal of all discriminations in the country 'constitution.
Another entity, the Federation of BiH and the Republika Srpska -- the two separate entity entities -- have passed the adoption of the BiH Federation and Republika Srpska -- to the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the 1992-1995 war in BiH.
Some observers say that the vote is open to use the absence of the parliamentary decisions by one of the entities.
The Dayton Agreement remains a constitution.
The decision came from a report by Finnish Kimino Sassi and Turkish Mevice-Caveoglu, the PACE report.
Sassi and Ceeroglu have linked BiH to the UNESCO, claiming that the entity is facing reforms and undermining state institutions.
This report and the decision focused on the basis of Bosnian parliament -- Milica Markovic and Mladen Ilic.
Parliament requested the decision to remove the union of three entities: urging the RS National Assembly to call for the right of their own life and accuses the RS 'decision to remove RS' state institutions in BiH.
PACE lawmakers, however, rejected these demands.
Only days before the CoE decision, BiH presidency member Haris Silajdzic met at the PACE meeting in Strasbourg, France.
Addressing the session, Silajdzic criticised the entity 'vote, saying that it is a major obstacle to the parliament to adopt the decision, and that BiH has blocked its progress towards EU membership.
Silajdzic also called for "a major reform" in the Dayton constitution, if BiH and the region can contribute to peace and stability.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said they will not accept the removal of some entity votes. "It would mean that this is a basis for the Dayton Peace Accord and would mean the institutional mechanisms that are protected in BiH," said RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik.
Although the CoE 'decision is a symbolic, the CoE must meet all governments in BiH to end the CoE to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Although the country is a CoE member in 2002, it is not able to fulfil all the requirements for membership.

As a result of the violence against extremists and militants, the film is continuing to reflect the weapons of Islam.
Meva Claudin Rumi, who is known as the Rumi Rumi of Britain, is known to be known for peace, tolerance, tolerance, tolerance and disaster in all countries.
It is still under way.
Municipal poet Rumi has formed the Mevi car as known as the Sema Foundation or Islam, and helped revive Islam.
Meva has a strong effect in Turkey, which is part of a model and a bridge between the Muslim community and the Muslim Middle East, as a bridge between Christian.
Earlier in December, the books and tourists are seeking to submit their respects to Meva during the anniversary of the death.
The Supreme philosophy is the establishment of biography, physical and peacekeeping.
Human Rights is seen as a small house, and believes it should be able to see him.
He continues to win respect and respect for traditional religious communities in a direct relationship between Tanoglu and humanity.
According to Meva, people, Managing and Sevasion are a third.
"The worst things with Asia could not be removed.

In the second part of the country, they are encouraging to learn about the concerns of the world.
Since then, they are trying to slowly to a slowly slowdown, which will be able to cope with consequences.
"We have a good database that we have been convinced," he said.
In recent years, the Meva philosophy -- the secret of secret, humanitarian intelligence, environment, and more people.
A Meva explosion in Western Europe, Britain and the United States has been explosive over the past decade.

During a three-day visit to Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and Tel Aviv, the Palestinian Committee criticised the unilateral efforts to bring the sovereignty.
The movements "sparked the peacekeeping process in order to boost the political solution", the Israeli National News Agency quoted Berisha as saying.
"The Palestinians are not true," Berisha said. "The peacekeeping talks between Israel and Palestinians should be repeatedly worried about the security of the two state."
Berisha met with President Jacques Peres, Prime Minister Benjamin Nuri and other key officials during his visit to the end of Wednesday (November 23rd).
During his visit, Prime Minister urged Israel to encourage investors to participate in projects such as construction of about 43 new hydropower plants.
During his meeting with Peres, Berisha pointed to agriculture, tourism, energy and information technology.
According to Hengii Coshi, a professor and analyst at the University of Tirana, Israel has shown the importance of the impact of international relations and growth in business relations with Albania.
"There are at least 20 Israeli companies in various areas such as weapons, water, energy, services and others," he told SETimes.
He also stressed that the visit was the role of Albania in international area.
"Israel will create a impact on Kosovo, which is not recognised by the state," he said.
Albania is optimistic to the Palestinian problem, he said, calling Berisha 'stance and pragmatic.
"I do not know any impact on relations with Turkey or other countries.
There are many traditional relations with Turkey.
Israel relations with Israel are very important, "he said.
On the other hand, Colan Bala, the Tirana daily Commerce, said the strengthening of economic relations could help Albania into the current global economic crisis.
The investments in agriculture are beneficial to Albania, but also said that the food is expected to increase food to Israel at a time when food rates are expected to increase.
At the same time, he said, the decentralisation market in Albania -- is expected to increase prices for EU membership -- could strengthen Israel from next year.
"Albania must develop its own capital market, and this will be the interest of major countries such as Israel," he said.
The relations between the two countries reflect a long-term friendship.
The Balkan country is widely praising Albania for its failure to hand over one of the Greeks' asylum seekers during World War II.
Albania, the communist era, has recognised Israel after Israel declared its independence in 1948.
However, diplomatic relations were not formed until August 1991.
technical dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina continues
Following the process of violence in the border crossings, the negotiators gathered in Brussels this week after seven weeks of the process.

The delegation representing Belgrade and Pristina agreed on Monday (November 21st) on a bilateral recognition of university diplomats.
Following a deal reached on July 2nd, the EU confirmed that "the two sides" agreed to adopt the approval of the ratification of diplomats in both sides' universities' diplomats' advocates or public intelligence.
Dukagjin Pupovski, director of the Kosovo Education Centre, said Kosovo will not benefit from this agreement, but believes other Serbian citizens who will benefit from the Presevo Vadar and Kosovo.
"However, this job is very serious and it will not accept diplomats after the Union of European University approved," he told SETimes.
During the agenda of talks in Brussels, the entities are also on other issues such as the representation of Pristina, population administration, and unified border management between Kosovo and Serbia.
The technical talks were suspended on September 27th after conflict between Serbs and KFOR troops in northern Kosovo.
Since then, Belgrade and Kosovo Serbs have announced that the approval of Kosovo customs officers in the north was unacceptable and forced to protest local Serbs.
The dialogue with Pristina, meanwhile, has made it clear on December 9th that the EU Council will decide whether Belgrade will be granted EU candidate status.
Following talks in Brussels, the head of the Belgrade delegation, Borislav Stefanovic, said that the delegation is doing to reach a deal, but did not know that Serbia is not able to meet its EU candidacy.
"Everything is a long time because of candidacy or final application, it is a long time and we have to resolve these problems and we have to do everything in northern Kosovo and Metohia, so we have to do everything," Stefanovic said.
He added that Pristina insists that Kosovo does not reflect the state situation and that Serbia does not reach another solution, because it does not know it.
Edita Tahiri, the head of the Kosovo delegation, told the media that dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade continues to be unchanged.
"This tournament revealed that we can say that we have closed a concrete agreement, and that we can not accept any unacceptable acceptable to the state border with Pristina," Stefanovic said.
Belgrade Political Sciences professor Predrag Simic told SETimes that the problems in Kosovo are very completely completely and that there is a lot of borders.
"A decision on the EU Council meeting and the candidacy of Belgrade is approaching the general elections in Serbia.
"The negotiations with Zaman have a risk for relations between both Belgrade and Pristina," he said.
The opposition in Serbia, however, use the talks to convince European officials to recognise Kosovo 'independence.
"We will not have any reason for the political and other development of the country," said Slobodan Samardzic, head of the Democratic Party of Serbia.
So far, there will be no reason.
The final outcome of the negotiations is that Serbia will give Kosovo and Metohija, "he said.
Kosovo Independent Media Commission
Today, the Independent Media Commission of Kosovo is not working on full work.
By Safet Kabashaj for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 23 / 11 / 11
The new Independent Independent Media Commission of Kosovo has caused some challenges to elect members. [Reuters]
The Kosovo Independent Media Commission (ICC) has been completely completed since December 2010, because some Council members are unaware.
Three members of the four members are not enough personnel to work because the Kosovo Assembly does not choose the approval of the two-year mandate and that the Kosovo Assembly does not choose them.
"We are convincing a significant part of the sector, because we are responsible for the decentralisation," IMF manager Naim Selimaj Krasniqi told SETimes.
There is a long-term mandate for the plan.
The system also envisions new rules and mobile operators for technical and operations.
The commission has to serve as a task of amendments and to enhance the national diaspora strategy.
Tomor People have managed to serve the "Interpol" in Doras Glloja, a central part of Kosovo.
Although the necessary documents were submitted, it expects the list.
Meanwhile, illegal operations are rising to punish.
"I wait for the ratification of the list to be ratified," he told SETimes. "I expect it to ratify the database," he told SETimes.
At the same time, they say they cannot ratify the list because the main Council is in the way. "
The European Commission cited that the Kosovo Assembly has not yet completed the appointment of five IMF members, the Kosovo Assembly said.
Earlier in 2011, the IMF submitted a list of eight candidates for the first half of the 17-seats.
A special committee, representing all political parties, submitted the list to four people to vote.
In July, however, parliamentary candidates have refused to discuss steps.
The commissioner was chairman of the ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), Berat Bukaga.
Bukaga says the group has completed its own part in its mandate.
"There is no reason in the IMF," Bukaga told SETimes. "The responsibility for the Gececi is parliament.
I was appointed as the head of the special committee, and then then the president has been appointed.
However, there is no unacceptable. "
Another committee member of the opposition Vetevendosje party, Albert Lama, says the responsibility is part of the problem, while the problem is at the government level.
"The government has a balance to control independent institutions.
This is why the new IMF Council members are not elected, "he said.
Former President Flora Bytyci says the Kosovo Assembly is not a new thing.
According to Bytyci, parliament has not elected the second member of parliament since 2008, and this law is a direct mandate.
"The delay in parliament began in 2007 after the mandate of the two Council members," Bytyci said.
The verdict, the IMF officials say, is more active in the media, and the Council of Minister-led obligations have stalled.
At the same time, the major uncertainty on the final outcome is continuing in decentralisation.
"We have a strategy for transition, but there is a strategy for other stakeholders," Krasniqi said, noting that the Council is not opposed to the end of the final decision, but the organisation is undermining the removal of the public.
The war continues to affect many BiH citizens
About half of the BiH population continues to affect the 1992-1995 war.
Experts warn that the problem could be defined if it is not interested.

War Crimes Mehmet Alic said the PTSD has helped professional assistance for the service. [Bedrana Kaletovic / SETimes]
"For years, there is a hundreds of explosives in front of the same day -- an explosives, a explosion, and only one of the weapons are concerned.
I do not try to find this option, but not the benefit.
"I think it is a smoking, and this is continuing for years," he said.
Another war crimes suspect, Mehmet Alic, is a similar factor.
At the same time, three years have been removed, and doctors were unexpected.
However, the number of workers who killed his friend is still unable.
The feature of the Merkel has been under control since it has a psychological shopping.
Alic says the same idea is difficult, but there is no longer difficult for the families of his family because of the unchanged situation.
"My children have been transferred to me.
"There is no reason and not only a battle on the war," he said.
Despite the end of the war 16 years ago, Experts say that the traffic system (PTSD) is a stable increase in the number of people.
Most former soldiers were killed, but they are seeking professional aid to protect their discrimination.
"Many people are seeking to assist professional psychological or psychologists who have lost a lot of jobs," Dragan Sajic, head of the PTD problem in Banja Luka, told SETimes.
According to the World Health Organisation, about 10% of the BiH population has been containing the PTSD, or 400,000 people.
However, they claim that the PTSD has helped the problem, the figure is four.
Doctors say the PTSD is a normal response to the environment conditions.
"The former soldiers are not able to give them to them, many major challenges, and the post-war health problems are slow.
"They want to resolve the disappointment, and they want to solve them through social discrimination against people," he said.
"If the PTSD is a permanent human or patient, there can be no permanent or patient, but it can be done under consequences," Dusan Kulenovic, the leader of Tuzla POD, told SETimes.
The PTSD is not only affected by war crimes, but also the personnel who were convicted during the war.
The representative of the Republika Srpska Committee of Community, Obrad Bubic, said that about 200 former prisoners have applied to professional assistance in Banja Luka over the past two years.
"The PTSD families and the society are not known as such as those people," Professor Dokin Hasanovic told SETimes.
"When it comes to a climate, many of the future generations are in part of a fear that will be destroyed," he said.
The NGOs and government organisations are working to reduce the results of the war in BiH, and the government are seeking a joint group that needs to help the war.
Since BiH public companies are not enough to deal with the budget, the problem continues to raise the problem.
Ivan Shijakovic, a Banja Luka writer, says the POSD victims will give the society, but the society has been able to spend.
"These people are not able to find a way to the disease of the hospitals of BiH, so that people are affected by the situation have been removed from their own circumstances, and they are submitted to the cheaper to the society," he said.
"We have no problems that will be able to address such problems," he said.
"We are aware that we are aware of our unilateral weapons, but we have to make our job," the FBiH daily told SETimes.
We are aware of similar organisations, because we are going to do so, "he said.
Following elections in Albania, women are low.
Despite the remarks that the government will increase the number of women in the May 8th seats, the number of candidates will not be sold.

The political parties in Albania have pledged to take action in accordance with the principles of gender equality and equal political principles, have not been called for calls for candidates for women in the May 8th local elections.
Only 17 per cent of the total 768 candidates are women and 3 per cent.
Even before the vote, political parties vowed that 30 per cent of the candidates will face the election law.
"We have a real truth among the political parties that have made the presence of the presence of women in politics," President Bamir Topi said at a meeting of the OSCE earlier this month on improving the role of women in the management of women.
"The political parties have not been convinced that the principles of gender equality and equality are not a cultural truth.
In a political climate that we do not give the votes to the voting and values, the candidates' votes are still in a political climate that will not be able to protect women, "he said.
"The current lack of equality in the governments in the country needs to be implemented, and all national and international partners are taking significant tasks for this," said OSCE Ambassador to Tirana Eugen Wolfere.
War rights actions have different opinions about the reasons for women to represent sufficient representation in politics.
"This is the conclusion of political leaders," said Blerina Metaj, a group of young people and minorities supporting political participation.
They are responsible for the basis.
Women and men are not a key factor for them, "he said.
The UN National Women Programme co-ordinator Fiora Soke is charged with the election law, which does not allow parties and circumstances.
"The biggest obstacle to women and young people in the world is that our political parties are the biggest obstacle to enter politics.
Women in Albania are not candidate in the elections, because they are supporting by politicians.
Women are forced to fight fundamental discrimination parties, which have the obstacle to significant and information. "
He added that the equal representative in the process of adopting a decision is needed and that the intervention should be multiethnic.
However, actions are not the same.
The head of the Albanian Human Rights Contact Group says women are the largest factor in this issue.
"The greatest risk of women.
Women are not aware of the most important, but they do not know how to see the female fans -- especially in politics.
"They [have] changed the people who are working with them," he said.
"Those who continue to continue with Azerbaijan, are still women.
"Women are in part of this role, ensuring their families, benefits of their children and manager," he said.
Albania shows economic crisis results
The Albanian economy is not good and charges.

Other major economic demonstrations, consumption spending has dropped. [Reuters]
At the same time, the government cited a number of economic performances in the first quarter of 2012, following a slow slowdown in economic growth over the past two years.
According to the INAT, inflation is considered the most serious obstacles that have reached 0.6% in February, as well as the demand for consumption, as well as the demands of consumption.
Special and public investments are reduced.
The largest climate is the construction and industrial sectors.
According to the INAT, Albanian citizens have dropped consumption in the first two months of this year, while imports dropped by 21%, according to the INAT.
One of the main resources of the Albanian economy, visitors showed 9% compared to 2010.
The government should accept the crisis as soon as possible, former Albanian Central Bank Chairman Sayim Chani said.
"[The government] has no austerity measures and now we are participating in the consequences of the computer and reactions," he told SETimes.
He predicts that this year will be more difficult.
"Borcic was very high, and it is now a lot of liquidity borders," he added, adding that the level of debt will increase by 2013.
Travel levels have reached around 60% of GDP.
The director of the Institute for Studies, Gjergorge Palesti, is concerned about the situation.
"The government, the largest investors in the country and the country, has been more expensive than in 2010 and 2011, and confirmed that the country has been able to block the crisis," he told SETimes.
However, MP of the ruling Democratic Party Chairman Slain Sahhu, is different.
"There is no other mechanisms in the government, and the austerity is a psychological response to international crisis," Sayu, a member of parliament 'Economic and Freedom Committee, told SETimes.
"The crisis is not only the factors in Albania.
Albania is not affected by the crisis, but there is no reduction in economic growth, "he stressed.
The Central Bank has dropped to 4.25% of Lebanon to boost consumer consumption, but the risk of the markets is weakened.
"The money [policy] could be more frequent.
The Central Bank could have a more precautionary reduction in the interest rates of 1% in the three months, "he said.
Shahu says it is "a partner of the state and public sector" to boost investments and employment.
The institutions, institutions, public administration, infrastructure, human rights and good management, could be a way to promote support for small and medium-medium-sized enterprises, he says.
The intervention "unfair" should be resolved, he says.
"However, the reform of the committee can be realised and unprecedented, but the problem of the reputation will be", he adds.
The IMF aims to create a 0.7% economic growth for Albania this year, while the regional level of 0.7%.
The Albanian government is more optimistic, with 4.3%.

International troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) organised a new operation against former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic on Tuesday (February 10th), following a new operation against his support of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic.
EUFOR, who served as the operation, said the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was fulfilled.
He said he was "unable to provide information to help the UN tribunal" continued efforts to continue their work ".
Milica Asim and the renewal of Mladic was served as NATO soldiers and Republika Srpska (RS) police in the villages of Vaskovic and Republika Srpska (RS), near Sarajevo, near the lives of Mladic.
International forces have not been arrested, although the international forces have been invited to submit a number of complaints.
"Both operations have been done in co-operation and problems," EUFOR spokesperson Patrick Patrick told Reuters on Tuesday. "The problems will continue and documents will be removed."
Mladic disappeared after UN prosecutors issued his first indictment against war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.
Mladic is allegedly indicted for genocide during the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 43-month Sarajevo and the murder of 8,000 Muslim men and boys.
While they think Mladic is hiding in Serbia, authorities have announced that it will receive 1m euros for information that would allow the arrest of the fugitives in recent months.
EUFOR said on Tuesday that any people who have made information could receive the award for 3.9m euros in the United States for years ago.
The full co-operation with the ICTY, including the arrest of war crimes suspects, is a key condition for the Balkan countries' membership in the 27-nation bloc.
The RS interior ministry also noted co-operation with the continuing efforts to hand over war crimes suspects, EUFOR praised members "professional professionals and their commitment to closing this case".
Raji Gregorian, the high representative in BiH, said on Tuesday that he expressed support for a joint operation and future efforts against Mladic 'support.
He said he would not be "unless a officer can" leave him to rescue him for the rescue of a officer.
Among other war crimes suspects that the ICTY has been sparked by the Balkan conflicts, former Croatian leader Goran Hadzic.

This week, employees in EU countries will be able to cope with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
The four BiH companies -- Mostar, Blagj, Banja Luka, Banja Luka and Stolac -- have repeatedly called on the Union to exercise exploration from member states.
Among the Balkans -- the country &aposs peacekeeping agency -- is one of the lowest BiH Serbs who say they could become competitive in the EU market.
"This export allows us to sell our exports in Europe.
"We have completed our provisions on weapons, and the facilities can start as soon as possible next month," he said.
However, four companies that have been sold last year are still unwilling to start exports.
Experts of companies say the prices will not be lower than the EU tax rates.
Experts are opposed to the EU as much as the tax on expenditures.
Currently, any firm can be exported as part of the tax consumption.
They are in the market with the increase of tax implementation.
As the EU has high standards for food imports, BiH has a trade deficit for every year, and BiH has a few billion euros in exports, especially in the Union, which does not need for security or quality documentation for every year.
Nevertheless, the BiH Chamber is seeking to export products for export products, as well as export products, as well as some exports.
The country will benefit from its exports to the Constitution (CE) to emphasise the quality of exports.
CE findings can be sold in all the EU to change change in every member country.
The EU consumers' demands of consumers are still believed to be the "ISO" optimistic ideas of the International Standard ", and the CE does not want to meet the requirements for meeting the EU.
Radomir Marinkovic, co-ordinator of the PHARE programmes in BiH, warns that such athletes will not be able to sell them in CEFTA countries soon, because they warn that they are more difficult to implement European rules.
Marinkovic is charged with the government to encourage exports to the importance of the CE station.

According to a survey by the Balkan Monitor, 64% of Croatian citizens believe that their countries are widespread.
However, only 7% want to go abroad for better economic prospects.
The results of the survey presented a conference in Zagreb last week.

The survey is a joint project by the European Fund and the Gallup.
The study represents the Balkan citizens' living standards, EU, business opportunities, abroad and the performance of governments.
Gallup European director Robert Manchin submitted the results of the conference on Friday (February 6th).
Insites and Persons: Voices in the Balkans
According to the survey, three in Macedonia protects a new conflict in the region.
"If European institutions do not want to support the Balkan states' accession into the EU.
At the same time, Croatia is the leader of the regional integration, and most of the Croats are not [in] part of the Balkans, "he said.
More than 25% of respondents support the Union for membership.
The number of citizens who say EU membership is beneficial, he said, is more than 29% (26%), but the majority of participants (38%) have not been formed.
According to the survey, Croatian citizens are declined to the EU.
Polls say the ongoing border dispute with Slovenia is one of the main factors that participated in the polls on the Union.
"Croatia has been in line with EU reforms?" he also discussed the consequences of public research. "How would it be the topic of EU reforms?" Manchin said. "How is the head of the European Council of Ministers' Council of Europe, Vesna Moravic, philosophi, physical and NGOs
According to Bozinovic, Croatia is still at only third of the EU negotiating chapters.
"These chapters are related to the administration, basic rights and market competition.
"I think we are time to meet our targets in the next period," he said.
Following the results of the survey, Pusic said many of them reflect their words.
"Croatia should have a tolerance against organised crime," he said.
For us, the most important is the judiciary. "
Puhovski voiced doubt that Croatia is more important for EU membership, saying that it is important for Croatia to join the EU, adding that Brussels is likely to fulfil its readiness to Zagreb.
With 82% of Kosovo participants, only 46% of the Croatian citizens "have been satisfied with" by the EU ".

Discussions on Kosovo
There are serious concerns that any details of the Ahtisaari proposal, which would allow Kosovo leaders to declare a unilateral declaration of independence.
By Robert and Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times -- 06 / 07 / 07
The UN Security Council has been debate on the future of Kosovo. [Getty Images]
Last week, the EU called for more delay over the Kosovo status issue.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned on Wednesday (July 4th) that any success in the Kosovo status issue would pay for Russia or the United States, not Russia or Europe.
Rehn called on EU security chief Javier Solana on Tuesday and said Brussels wants to find a compromise on the Kosovo issue as soon as possible.
The bloc has made it clear that the UN Security Council has made a new decision to urge former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari &aposs plan for supervised independence.
At this point, all governments in Kosovo are hoping to do this job in order to meet the authority of the province, as well as to ensure that it can be able to meet its authority.
They say they are likely to be completed by the end of May, and they continue to hope that the Ahtisaari plan would be accepted.
Kosovo leaders have warned that they will be able to do their own path if the Security Council decides.
The international community is not known to be affected by this issue.
Last month, US envoy for Kosovo Frank Wisner reiterated Washington &aposs support for Kosovo, and said the final goal should be sovereignty of the province.
However, Wisner said, "It is important that independence will be prepared for recognition and that a UN Security Council resolution that will open closer to NATO and the EU".
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica says Serbia wants the negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina to decide on the status issue. [Getty Images]
The unilateral declaration of independence is dangerous for a number of reasons.
Therefore, the EU and the region will cause all over the years of supporting regional stability and integration.
Will Balkan countries need to say they want European and the United States' Ahtisaari plan? How do you want to enter Euro-Atlantic structures?
At the same time, the Security Council / EU / EU / Security Council will represent a joint feasibility responsibility for the United States.
The Security Council plays a greater role in Serbia, if the EU and the United States are not co-operated.
Albania will be one of the first countries in Pristina, while the rest of the region will have to be more active.
For example, Montenegro will not be one of the first countries that have to continue good relations with Serbia.
There is no more things in Macedonia, and the Albanian minority is not able to attract foreign affairs.
If Bulgaria and Romania are in front of recognition as well as Montenegro, they are willing to see it at the end.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a situation that will recognise Kosovo, but Croatia and Slovenia can not be able to see it as a result of its weakness on weaknesses.
While British President Nicolas Sarkozy has not changed his plan, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has not met many tolerance in Kosovo, the proposal for talks between Albanians and Serbs.
Belgrade will continue to insist on a final solution on Russia to help Kosovo, in order to convince the country that it will be a dangerous international arbitration.
As a result, Belgrade &aposs diplomacy targeted members of the Security Council -- Slovakia, South Africa and India -- as well as EU member states that could face problems in their own territory as a result of Kosovo.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica insisted that Belgrade has insisted that negotiations with Pristina, but would require that the negotiations would not have any consequences, if it is successful.
Belgrade called for a new international mediator.
Belgrade will also want to improve its position in Kosovo, especially in the north of Pristina.
The new problem, however, is that only 130,000 Serbs in Kosovo live in the areas where the rest of the Albanian population is in the north.
Kosovo and Metohija Minister Slobodan Samardzic said that Serbia wants to invest in Kosovo and do everything to ensure a major presence in institutions in the province.
If the foreign factors were sparked, the unilateral declaration of independence will not benefit Kosovo.
While UNMIK is in the province, a new EU mission will not start.
The UN will no longer feel it and will be divided within the EU.
The most important is the Balkans to face instability.

On Sunday (April 25th), the local elections and media in the village of Ardjelovac, the small town of Belgrade, showed that many see this as a sign of the country &aposs political climate.
The elections for the current parliamentary elections were still part of the Serbian Radical Party (SNS), a part of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which is part of the last general elections in May 2008.
According to the first results, the SNS (26.1%) received five per cent in front of President Boris Tadic 'ruling Democratic Party (DP).
The opposition Liberal Democrats, who supported the government &aposs initiatives, won a single seat.
The DP can still be able to win a majority in the Ardjelovac parliament if the state level partners with coalition partners.
While the DP can expect the parties to win 21 seats, the opposition could be able to 20 seats.
"The election results in Ardjelovac have voted in a pro-European government and supports the parties that have the ruling majority in the state level," the DP quoted Nada Kolija as saying.

The SP won 14.24% of the vote in the elections in Arjelovac.

"They are not willing to take the votes and take the way to restore the assembly," he said.
Nikolic said the SNS will decide whether the ruling Democrats do not have to form a market with the Democrats.
"If we recognise the Prosecutors, we can [get] without the negotiations," he said.
The Serbian Radical Party, a key parliament in the past, will not be represented in the parliament.
Radicals hope that the elections in a poll will allow them to give up the 5% election climate, where they need more than 60%.
Dragan Todorovic, deputy head of the party, told SETimes that the SNS is still aware of "couple and violations".
"We expect our leader Vojislav Seselj to return to The Hague by the end of the year, this will strengthen the political position," Todorovic said.
The opposition has signed the public to call early elections since February.
Petar Stamatovic, a Belgrade pensioner, believes the elections in Ardjelovac are believed to be a reflection of public opinion that the government change in Serbia.
"The Progress Party is the strongest party in Serbia, and this should be proved as early as general elections," Stamovic told SETimes.
Many, such as Education Milica Zivkovic, do not agree.
"I believe that this government should be given a chance to complete its mandate by 2012.
"I don [know] that the early elections will be able to give up."
Tadic rejected all elections.

German citizens oppose any rescue plan for Greece.
Earlier on 9 May, Merkel said Greece must submit a detailed budget plan for 2011 and 2012 to win bilateral loans.
According to media reports Wednesday, Greece will help the eurozone and the IMF by 120 billion euros in three years as part of the agreement.
Most of that amount to 45 billion euros will be reached in Athens this year.
According to the AP, Germany, the largest economy in Europe will meet about a few months.
EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday that the talks would be completed "in the coming days" and promised that details on the rescue package will soon be made soon.
"I hope that the aid package will give Greece a clear opportunity to pressure from financial markets," Rehn told reporters in Brussels. "I want to emphasise that this is not only in Europe, but not only because of the financial stability in the world and citizens in Europe."

Earlier this month, Macedonian police took over the security control of the country with Greece.
The move was part of efforts to bring Macedonia into line with EU and NATO standards.
About 650 members of the new board will ease the border with the 250km south.
Addressing the extradition ceremony, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said Macedonia is one of the last few countries that are protected by police officers in Europe.
Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski described the new service as one of the basic aspects of national security, saying it is one of the conditions for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
According to Zoran Sekulovski, a spokesman for the Macedonian Army, police are planning to control all borders by the end of 2005.
The eastern border with Bulgaria by the end of this year will represent the control of the border between Albania and Albania in early next year.
The military will continue its control of the northern border with Serbia-Montenegro by the end of 2005.

A total of 83 US soldiers is a foreign situation in Sema Travka, which is not a foreign currency.
Following Travka 'telephone and electricity bills, it is easy to facilitate the rescue of the remaining money. "The 72, a 72, says it is not aware that we will have to buy the weapons to buy the weapons.
"Everything is not a case, but everything is in five or ten," Trajka said at the Breka resort in Sarajevo.
One of the factors' writers, Trajka is helping him.
"This is the main reason for us.
"We are not only all the pensions and all of the people in the region," he said.
There is no money that will be allocated, "he said.
Together with the pensions in neighbouring Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia, not only with people who live in the problems, but also the pensions in Travka.
Everything -- a long time, the pension salaries are waiting to recognise the former Yugoslavia.
However, the former Yugoslavia has been part of a day.
The penalties are now the new citizens who live with the population.
According to Zoran Anusic, a professor of the World Bank in Zagreb, the pension reform of Croatia, which was launched in 1995, is a better position.
Croatia is now doing "limited" in the pension system, Anusic said, adding that this country could be a example of example in other countries.
The penalties are the average average of 235.
This is a long way.
The reforms are on the way to reform -- the survey rate of companies who pay pensions has increased to 90 per cent.
The approach of the Croatian pension reform is widely pointing out with Serbia, while the Hellenic Human Rights Committee says the "pension system" in Serbia.
"There is no law on the judiciary, judiciary reform," he said.
They have a lack of jobs (unemployment) in the country (40 per cent), the unemployment rate (40 per cent) has tried to work in unpaid businesses, health or pension.
The average average salary for pensions in Serbia was on November 10th.
Following former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic more than two years ago, pensioners have been pending pensions, but the ruling coalition led by a social reform.
In this case, he said, foreign factors supporting the budget have caused pressure.
"This business [is] a business reform [,] the government is not ready to do so," Bajko said.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the state is not only the state, but the pension of two governments that have been responsible for the state.
The average salaries in the Federation, which is a better position, are the average of 106.
However, pensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina (RS) in Republika Srpska (RS) can only get 66 per cent.
Even though the amount of amounts have been able to cover this year.
"Employment salaries [in Albania] are not low," said Redzuli, head of the RS Association of Public Actions. "In December, this is not low," he told Radio Free Europe (Free Europe).
The average salaries of pensions in RS are only 35 per cent, he added, adding that this rate is 50 per cent in Croatia and Serbia.
Bosnia and Herzegovina High Representative Kevin Sullivan says the reduction of pension salaries in two governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina is facing reforms.
"It is not allowed to give Ali Talat and give the Vlora," Sullivan said. "The institutions have to be formed by the IMF to establish more than half of the details.
The pension institutions now have to pay thousands of people who have no pension institutions, he said.
The war between August 1992 and 1995 is a key part of the Bosnia and Herzegovina economy before the war.
The companies, which are still at large, are selling to pay for pension funds.
The Federation Director for Fund Majic said that at least 3,000 companies are not able to pay the pension survey.
It is the only way to protest the families' families' abroad, as well as the money for their families' abroad, which is now a situation in both governments.
Sarko Liljanic, head of the Federation of Employment Association, says that more than 70 per cent of the pensioners can be able to have more than 200 environmental assets in Mark.
"This is not a process because the pensions are limited to death," Liljanic said, adding that "pensions are unacceptable to the death of death."
The situation of refugee refugees is more complex.
In the last couple, Coko Kidkovic, who was frozen from Sarajevo in 1992, was dismissed by Serbian officials.
The Federation officials, who returned to his house in 2001, refused to grant the pension pension.
Among other governments, pensions could require a pension of pension.
Furthermore, this situation is an economic obstacle to obtain returns.
The two system is also cautioning that young people are able to go to the other management zone, because these people fear that the pension salaries in other managing management are widespread.
The International Crisis Group has made a proposal for the management of responsibility and the state to resolve the problems.
Therefore, the pensioners' pensions are aiming to return to their homes.
The responsibility for the two governments of the state will take the responsibility of the two governments, and the survey will be easily easily easy.
The survey is more survey that the salary of pensions, such as Sahin Trajka, could be more transformed into a few months.
"Everything will be better," he said.
However, what can you know what will be good, "Trajka said.
Greek Cypriot Prime Minister: New Cyprus Talks to Open in April
Discussions on a new Cyprus initiative could begin soon to continue talks with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a bid to reunify the reunification plan.
Officials, however, warn, that a success should be prepared for more successful.
(FT, Turkish Daily News - 31 / 03 / 05; Reuters, NTV MSBC, World News Agency, EurActiv, EUobserver - 30 / 03 / 05; AFP, Athens News Agency, Cyprus News Agency - 29 / 03 / 05)
"We have to ask that a successful outcome is to ensure that we have no crisis because of the Cyprus issue and not a good negotiation framework," said Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister George Jakovou. [AFP]
Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister George Jakovou said on Wednesday (March 30th) that consultations on a new Cyprus peace initiative will likely take place after the April 17th Turkish Cypriot presidential elections.
In the weeks, the talks, which are expected to begin months, will be confiscated to the reunification of the divided island.
"The talks on the island will likely likely be at the start of negotiations," Reuters quoted him as saying on Wednesday.
"We have to ensure that a successful outcome of the Cyprus issue is not able to ensure that we have no crisis because we are not able to solve the Cyprus issue and a good negotiation framework," he said in April.
During a meeting of the previous Cyprus peacekeeping initiatives, a medical mediator in the UN is doing doctors between the Greek Cypriots and the south of Cyprus.
The two sides are not concrete.
The latest effort to resolve the Cyprus issue was made in April 2004, when the Greek Cypriots rejected an agreement proposed by the Greek Cypriots.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots accepted the UN plan, only the Greek Cypriot part of the Mediterranean island joined the EU on 1 May.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has made clear that a new round of talks will not be launched if the possible agreement is weakened.
He met with Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molatiatis in Annan this week, urging Cyprus to reunify efforts.
Both officials agreed that there should be serious preparations.
"This time we need to do so," he said after a meeting with Annan in New York on Monday.
He said on Tuesday that the UN chief wants to see the Greek Cypriots' rejections last year as an option of criticism.
"It is expecting that this is a way.
"We want to be confident that the negotiations are simply convinced," he said. "It does not want a successful success."

The Serbian people have made clear that they are high, as Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was at the ceremony of the indictment, which was held by Moscow.
Putin arrived in Belgrade on Wednesday (March 23rd) to discuss President Boris Tadic and other senior officials.
The hundreds of people gathered in front of the Serbian front of the talks to elect Russian leader.
Putin started to play between Belgrade and Moscow "and local fans" Kalinka ", when he played a player among the Red Star and Zener football players in Belgrade and Moscow.
It was 1-1.
In recent years, Russian influence in the country, Gazprom Necdet has made significant investments, such as Gazprom 'majority stake in NIS and plans for the South Stream gas pipeline project to ratify the South Stream gas pipeline.
Investments and economic co-operation were among the first in the agenda of Putin 'visit.
Putin also confirmed that Russian companies will support Serbia 'efforts to build the road.
Serbian construction workers, meanwhile, will serve as part of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Sofia and preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
"We want to help our Serbian partners to benefit from broad experience on the construction of tourist facilities," Putin said.
The South Stream project assured that the South Stream project will be implemented in the coming years, Tadic said.
With the NIS 'profit, Gazprom has started to resume the restructuring of investments, Tadic said that both countries want to be active in regional markets, and said he expects more investments in the Pancevo oil refinery.
Tadic voiced confidence that Serbia would help Belgrade on the issue of Kosovo and supports Belgrade, which is supporting the global economic crisis.
According to political analyst Vladimir Goati, however, the public should not increase the capacity of Moscow to help the Serbian economy.
"Russia is facing its own problems, and it is not the right to expect Serbia to help it so far," Goati told SETimes.
"The Russian leadership is increasingly higher than the economic and political capacity, and the expectations are cautioned," he said.
Goati believes the most important power force in the relations between Belgrade and Moscow is the most important challenge.
"It is a very important and very important for Serbia to overcome its territory of the South Stream pipeline."
One of the key issues the visit was the EU integration process.
The Russian leader reiterated that Moscow is not worried about Serbia wants to join the bloc.
"We will assume the process of European integration, and we will work together with the process that is not affected by Russian relations," Putin said.
Serbia is determined to join the EU, but "Russia is part of its strategic interests in co-operation with Russia," Tadic said.
"I think that the EU can solve energy problems without co-operation with Russia.
Serbia will be part of the arrangement. "

For example, we revealed the BT reform reforms, which envisions the work of officers in Estonia last year.
We assessed the best practices in Macedonia.
The process also envisions more transparency.
Estonia has started to reduce the number of people in the mechanism to decide, and it has been pushing to leave the human factory.
We also discussed the best practice in the United States and other European countries.
SETimes: How will the new system is more responsibility, and how will it be granted?
Ivanovski: In the new law, the public employees will be more active, but they will have to replace a new system that will allow "exercise".
In addition to preparations, we will start working on psychological monuments and personnel.
Most factors are part of the education situation and average assessment.
We are facilitating the process of labour.
If a public worker has not been convinced, the Special Agency will continue to continue as a provisional commissioner, and will decide whether to return to the job.
The mandate of the former mandate will be very important.
In addition to evidence, a commission will be formed to decide whether the work will be responsible for the work and will not be able to return to the police.

Nexhat Ozhi did not allow many business visitors to join the EU last year.
The situation, however, is not imposed by its own income, but in any time, according to Ozek.
"No time, we have applied to EU consumer interests, and they do not see visa liberalisation as soon as possible," he said.
The 46-year-old project manager at the Black Sea coastal coastal coast says he had to wait more than two months before he wants to meet with European partners.
"Our EU and Turkish governments need to learn all political interests, and to see the citizens.
Serbia, Albania, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina can travel to Europe, while Turkish businessmen who want to participate in the protocol do not want to visa liberalisation or abroad, "he said.
Turkish businessmen who are waiting for European preparation for nearly a decade have now been pushing.
Last month, EU foreign ministers agreed to start talks with Ankara on this issue: Austria, France, France, Greece, Germany, Germany and the Netherlands oppose a visa liberalisation.
Ankara, meanwhile, says it will not sign a reunification agreement if the visa requirements are not removed.
"Turkey does not accept different charges," the foreign ministry said in a statement.
According to Dodik D. Dodik, this is "a negative consequence" against Turkey.
"We have come from a period of time when the Turkish public questioned that the EU can live as a partner." We have not been a bad time for the EU foreign ministers to exercise such visa liberalisation, "he said.
The current policy is an obstacle to commercial relations, he says, and a candidate country has restricted visa liberalisation.
Meanwhile, the EU has allocated thousands of euros for visa liberalisation every year.
Alexander Burzak, a professor at Izmir Economic University, is more optimistic:
"Turkey is now a huge situation, and the EU could require a reunification agreement between visa liberalisation talks with the third countries in the past, while the visa liberalisation agreement could be allowed," he said.
According to him, some groups such as students and researchers can recognise visa-free visa-free travel, and the company could be allowed to be allowed for a number of visitors.
Although the European Commission is aware to wait a step forward on the implementation of visa liberalisation, he said, the European Commission is important to support political support for the dialogue process, that EU accession talks could win a new symbolic.
However, it is very important for Ozgur.
"I know that we have to wait more than a year, I can 'interest in connections in Europe.

Bulgarian presidential election is expected to win Parvanov
Most of the Bulgarian people are waiting for the second time in the October 22nd presidential elections.
However, polls say, the second round could be held due to low turnout.

Bulgaria will win seven candidates in the October 22nd presidential elections.
However, a week after the accession is expected, the second round could be held.
According to the law, about 6.4 million votes in the presidential elections must go to the polls at least 6.4 million votes in the country, in order to declare his victory over 50% of the vote.
Czech Czech Tomov, a columnist at the Sweda company, said on Monday (October 9th) that the possibility of this is low.
The number of people who want to vote has dropped since the beginning of the campaign, the AFP said in a survey conducted by the public poll, adding that the number of people will be reduced.
According to the AFP, Georgi Parvanov continues to take a major chapter in two weeks, while the voters are planning to win 88 per cent of votes -- or plans to vote for the second five-year term -- Parvanov believes that Parvanov will win a five-year term this month.
Polls show the support for Parvanov has dropped over the past few days, but the opponents are still a major factor.
Bulgaria is expected to vote by 35% and 37% of the vote, which means about 70 per cent of the vote.
However, the second sixth of the other six opponents will be possible to vote in the second round of voting on 29 October.
Volen Siderov, leader of the nationalist group of nationalism, has the support of about 19% of all voters who can vote in the polls, or 22% of those who are likely to go to the polls.
Nebocho Beronov, 78, is the head of the Constitutional Court, and was third in the public polls with 1% of the leader 'leader.
Beronov was nominated by the opposition Democrats for Bulgaria, Democratic Union of Democratic Union and other small parties.
Beronov and other deputy candidate Georgi Markov have a little difference.
Sofia Mayor Boyko Borisov, one of the most popular politicians in the country, described Beronov as "at least the worst".
In an interview last week, Borisov said the aim of supporting his support is to remove Siderov 'possibility to win the president.
Borissov said that this would have a reality on the country.
However, only 5% of the mayors are expected to vote to Beronov, while 46% said Parvanov would vote for Siderov, 12% of the 12%.
The polls are unlikely to change the situation in the second round, but Parvanov and Sarkov are expected to win a second round.

BIRN chief Gordana Igric speaks to SETimes. [File]
Gordana Iric, founder of the Balkan Investment Information Agency (BIRN), says the need for quality, independent journalism in the region will allow the organisation to stop.
"This will live with BIRN," he told Southeast European Times.
"If the global economic crisis has been forced, we have failed to stop more time in time. [BIRN] has been established in 2005, we have not been able to invest more than a decade.
"We have successful and we will send it in a way," he said.
Although the organisation is a sign of commercial business, BIRN is being organised by the European governments and the Netherlands, supported by the European governments, such as Rocopoulos Fund and Balkan Traffic, and supported by the Netherlands and Norway.
Igric said that the Balkan NGO has no long-term support for donations from donors, so that he and friends are willing to take new challenges and money.
One of the BIRN websites is hoping to get a special part of the poor.com (pian.com), and the BIRN is hopeful that the team will be removed by special mediators of the BIRN Report.
A five-day daily Insight was financed by 100% of donors, but the Belgrade Insight revenues are being replaced by 60%.
Igric believes that the Belgrade daily "can be able to stay in its own."
A independent journalist in the Balkans still developed.
According to Freedom House, a international organisation supported by "Special institutions", Slovenia is the only country in the region.
Among other Balkan countries, the "smaller free" rating.
A 2009 report by Freedom House showed that journalists in the Balkans have been threatened to threaten violence -- the murder of journalists in Bulgaria and Croatia in 2008 -- and the regional media are being implemented.
In 2008, the organisation said, "all important changes on media freedom in the Balkans are negative."
Igric insisted that the journalism "is not" smaller ", but insists that it is not completely complete.
"There are more serious players.
Investors are abroad and they are offering better salaries, "he said.

UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari will submit a report on Kosovo and recommendations on Friday (February 2nd).
Most of Kosovo Albanians expect the plan to declare independence as a condition for the province.
According to the Pristina Nedjomir Public, the Ahtisaari plan called for "supervised independence", but the key obligations that have been in the province.
"It is very important to know that Kosovo will be implemented in implementing a strong economic standards and the respect of human rights," he said.
Agon, a student of political scientists, is the same idea.
"I am better in Kosovo.
We insist that independence is not very important, but also for Kosovo Albanians, "he said.
"I think that Kosovo will be good for all," he said.
Everyone is not optimistic.
Another political scientists, Sami Ktrati, worries that the international community is facing the rising risk of a successful state creating Kosovo.

Pristina can apply for membership in international organisations and will serve as a UN official for Kosovo.
Speaking to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg last week, Ahtisaari described the proposal as "fair and stable".
He stressed that the main goal is to ensure that all communities in the province have a peacekeeping life.

The Croatian parliament has moved to end the EU market, which is a requirement for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, last week to end customs exports.
The new customs exporter exports were set to 180,000 tonnes annually.
The amount of taxes will be reduced.
Opposition parties have warned that the government would remove the three Croat factory, due to a boycott of EU demands.
The parties say the Croatian industrial industrial industry will face more than half euros, and that the largest farmers will be able to see.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has been critical of his criticism for restrictions.
The head of the Agriculture and Community Committee, Bozidar Panktic, argues that the new exports should not be at least 30,000 tonnes of exports.
"The new external export bailout will be removed by Croatia with 180,000 tonnes of passports," he said, claiming that the witness would be limited to the production.
Agriculture Minister Petar Cobankovic, however, supports the government decision.
Cobankovic says Croatia is only 120,000 tonnes of goods to the EU for a year, so that it will not harm any recognition.
According to Cobankovic, Croatia will not threaten its export production of exports, with the European Commission, as well as good trade relations with the European Commission.
Cobankovic says that the agreement signed with the EU is not reluctant to opposition politicians, although the agreement was signed with the Croatian products.
"The agreement envisions the agriculture sector of Croatia, which will not be based on exports, it is better to enable the export market.
Therefore, Croatian producers are satisfied with changes, "he said.

While Stros Karatris signed an agreement with international loans to cover a second bailout loan to Greece, his country is unwilling to defend the war crimes suspects.
Thanasiou, who arrived in 83, said the government is doing a business climate for half a century, because it continues to push for a smaller pension.
Although the government said the agreement has resigned the future generations of the country, the Greek citizens are being implemented in the standard of living by 22% to 25% of their liquidity, and there are no reduction in other jobs.
Former Prime Minister Lucas Papademos praised the second loan package of 109 billion euros from the EU-ECB Troika to complete the first rescue loan of 109 billion euros, but also with the second package of austerity measures aimed at dealing with Greece 'austerity measures.
The unemployment rate is about 21% -- 488% -- and more than 111,000 businesses, while there are estimates that it will be more than a long term.
Parliament acknowledged that the budget this year will not pay 3.2 billion euros, while pensions, pensions, health and defence sector spending will be reduced, with the main goals that will receive 400m euros.
They suggested that the Eurozone finance ministers are trying to keep Greece on February 21st as part of the region as part of a contract with the Regional Regional Directorate (PSI), which has been supporting the financial bloc, and said they are trying to send 100m euros under a contract with uncertainty investors.
"The situation will be difficult and more difficult," Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in a statement before the vote. "We are now trying to work together with the decisions on February 21st, but we are working with a safe framework, compromise, consensus, consensus and banks."
"We have to do everything else," Karatinis, the head of the European and International Criminal Tribunal for Greece and New Democracy, told SETimes.
You can build a new economy, but we have not been able to build a Greek territory, "he said, sent a letter to Cyprus after 38 years of intervention, which has been divided in the divided island, and that the crisis could benefit from the crisis.

"I am not only worried, but there are people who are people who have the families of their families," he told SETimes.
Although he said, he added, "Now I think it will be able to use the old business climate." I think it will be able to use it, "he added.
Papademos said it is a decision to build new pensions for the money, but it is a alternative and simple.
Venizelos, who won two votes and poverty tax taxes, said the agreement would open the way for the PSI agreement and would benefit the country in the long term.
"Everything abroad can lead to security, unemployment and traffic situation," he said.
"With this new loan, we have protected the country to reduce its debt from the euro, which is now at least that time," Samaras said.
Meanwhile, experts did not affect the employees of public sector salaries by 30%.
Some private sector sector salaries have been reduced to 50% in order to reduce the salaries, and some employees have dropped up to 400 euros per month.
The soldiers reached a point of resources.
A couple of intellectual employees in the Committee on Friday sparked three people in front of the house in the house, and several hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds before justice.
Pantel Magos, director of the business centre in Commander, told reporters that the attack was the money.
"We condemned that there is no need.
The problem, however, does not think that the weapons are doing.
Everything is that unemployment and salaries have been reduced.
They are problems that we will continue to face. "
Agrios Tomas, head of the Economic and Industry Centre for Economic and Industry Studies in Athens, said the two sides of a reputation that Greece has not been removed with a sovereignty.
"This is a very optimistic programme that will strengthen the crisis.
We are estimated that this measures are affected by 3% of GDP -- from 4.5%, "he said.
"This is a deal that needs to have the second loan, especially to create a positive impact on the PSI," he added.
Papademos believes the economy could be able to convince itself in 18 months, but that new growth ideas should not be done.
Public, an economist at the Ioina University, said Greece is a long way to meet.
"The problem on the bill is reducing tax revenues," he told SETimes, noting that consumption spending is reduced to 333m euros in revenues by January 2011.
"It is the only way to support reforms that have a lot of disappointments," he said, noting that the government is unwilling to replace many Greeks -- mistakes, architectures, architecture and lawmakers.
The measures will be successful, and this is a high number of people who have a high number of young people who have been able to see any future, says Alexander Afxidis, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Athens.
"This is a scale, for years," he told SETimes. "This is a full part of the social environment that we have our job.
"We have not shown that we do not show this."

With talks on the new government in Serbia, the ruling Democratic Party of Serbia announced on Wednesday (January 31st) a number of conditions for Kosovo that the country will accept the next cabinet.
The plan, led by the DSS and 21 January parliamentary elections, has insisted that the new government should "be able to protect the territorial integrity of the country" as the main constitutional obligations ".
The DSS submitted the document to President Boris Tadic on Tuesday, when consultations on the new government.
The DSS has announced the public two days after UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari will visit Belgrade on Friday to submit his proposal for a solution to the Kosovo status issue.
While the Ahtisaari plan is not detailed, the plan is widely widely expected to be part of a balance that will open Kosovo 'path to the state.
The basic proposal, which is still unchanged, reportedly would allow Kosovo to recognise Kosovo as a sovereign state.
"There should be no country that has decided to recognise Kosovo [independence] (SNS) [to recognise] independence], the Belgrade-based Beta news agency quoted the SDS-NS plan as saying.
The UN, the EU, the World Bank, the World Bank and the IMF, reportedly reportedly will be allowed to apply for membership in international organisations.
"If any country or the international organisations accept Kosovo and Metohija 'independence, the Serbian government will insist that such a decision in the international community will condemn such a law, discrimination and application," the DS-NS platform continues.
They also warned that any NATO member states would cause Kosovo a "serious precautionary" between Serbia and the Alliance, if it recognised Kosovo as an independent country.
Observers see Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica 'move as a reduction of a pro-European ruling coalition between democratic forces in the country.
The SDS-NS coalition won 47 seats in the Serbian elections.
These results have made Kostunica for his role in the establishment of the new government.
The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which is the most voted in the coalition, could connect its forces with Tadic 'Democratic Party (DS).
The requirements that Kostunica &aposs party have been repeatedly approaching its position on Kosovo.
DS and former Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said the G17 Plus party does not oppose Kosovo independence, but they have repeatedly revealed the issue.
The only Serbian party supported Kosovo &aposs independence is the Liberal Democratic Party, led by former Prime Minister Cedomir Jovanovic.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has decided to suspend one of the first time since 1993.
The trial against former Bosnian Serb paramilitary Radovan Stankovic will be sent to the war crimes tribunal in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), according to a commission adopted by the UN tribunal on Tuesday (May 17th).
As the ICTY will complete all activities by 2010, the court officials said that some medical and low cases in the Balkans will be transferred to national courts in the Balkans to ensure that the court will take over the trial and detention over top indictees. More than 50,000 war crimes suspects, including Ratko Mladic and Ratko Mladic, are still at The Hague.
"No responsibility is not the factors that have been charged with the responsibility of the defendants' indictments, which will not be able to exercise Bosnia and Herzegovina national authorities," the ICTY said in a statement Tuesday.
Stankovic, 36, was indicted in 1996 with seven other counts of war crimes committed against Bosnian Muslims and Croats, which were arrested in April 1992. On July 9th 2002, he was arrested by UN prosecutors in The Hague on July 9th 2002 and sent a separate indictment to The Hague.
The indictment charges four counts of crimes against humanity and hundreds of illegal immigrants, as well as four counts of violations of the laws and traditional violations of the attack against humanity and personal intelligence.
According to UN prosecutors' claims, Stankovic is serving as a soldier at the Miljevina Tauration Treaty in BiH at the beginning of the 1992-1995 conflict, and a Bosnian Muslim group was established as a prominent framework.
The indictment says that between August 1992 and October 1992, many other soldiers are responsible for their responsibility, and that at least nine Muslim men and men were flexible for the time, as well as punishment of genocide and genocide.
"During the death, many civilians were killed and murdered during the death were killed and murdered," the AP quoted the indictment as saying. "Most of the women were convicted in detention and abuse of genocide conditions, including genocide conditions, and abandoned," the AP quoted him as saying.
Stankovic 'role in these allegations, women and men are convinced to hand over at least two people, including abolishing and sexual executive, and a third quarter of the three-month period.
UN judges have decided to accept a proposal to BiH authorities after the prosecutors' office decided to accept a number of factors such as implementation of BiH law enforcement and a fair judiciary.
The judges said the judges "are the current measures to protect witnesses" and will not be sentenced ", according to a statement by the ICTY.
Under the decision Tuesday, Stankovic will send BiH within 30 days.
The defendants and the prosecution are 15-year-old to convince the decision.
UN prosecutors want to take over BiH more than several other war crimes cases, Reuters reported.

The Greek banks' circumstances of loan and credit procurement protocol are continuing, despite the number of increasing debt.
The banks are unable to meet the necessary payments.
The consequences that a total of personal debt in Greece have been consisting of a smaller majority of GDP, but the number of banks' wife is not clear.
The private debt situation in Greece has been reached by the rising rates.
The bills have been attended by third since 2000.
According to official national statistics, only 10 per cent of Greeks are austerity, and more than 30 per cent of the vote are spent, and more than 30 per cent of the remaining winners are being sold.
One of the ten loans have been sold, and only the amount of smuggling has been spent.

The Cyprus, recognised by technology experts in the Mediterranean, will live on Saturday (April 24th) for the most critical day in the past 30 years.
The two sides of the divided island will vote for the UN peacekeeping and reunification plan, which is prepared by the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots as "Annan Plan".
The plan aims to resolve one of the most important international issues and to ensure a unified Cyprus accession into the EU on 1 May.
Annan Plan is still a 9,000-page document, although it has been removed.
diplomats and international experts have not reached a compromise that the plan would provide a compromise, such as each entity.
The EU plan is uncertainty that the plan will not be able to leave the legal level.
So far, however, the only problem will be approved by the approval of the referendum.
The latest public polls suggest that the north is possible.
A survey by the Centre for Public Studies and Education in northern Cyprus shows that 62 per cent of Turkish Cypriots are in the plan.
Meanwhile, a survey showed that the plan between Greek Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots dropped every day.
The vote was 71 per cent on April 14th, 62 per cent and 54 per cent on April 16th.
However, this meanwhile, does not mean that the votes are high.
The number of Greek Cypriots supporting Annan plan was 14 April, 13 per cent and 17 per cent on April, respectively.
At the same time, the verdict was a result of the vote. On 14 April, the decisions on 17 per cent of the total 17 per cent were able to 29 per cent on April.
Without the results, the referendum will affect international policy.
The United States, the EU, Greece and Turkey will be the best consequence of both sides.
In this case, both communities in Cyprus will become a member of the EU on 1 May.
This will remove an obstacle to Turkey &aposs accession into the EU.
If the referendum is confirmed, the Greek Cypriot side will be responsible for resolving the problem.
As a result, analysts say, only Turkey could cause the peacekeeping zone on northern Cyprus, which recognised as an independent state.
If the plan refused to reject the two sides, the referendum is expected to be repeatedly repeatedly after Cyprus joined the EU on 1 May.
The worst scenario for Turkey is accepted by the Greek Cypriots, but it would be rejected by the Turkish Cypriots.
This could cause both Turkey and the north of Cyprus.

In Croatia, debt and investment funds have become a popular opportunity for long-term investments.
However, the market, which has continued to rise from seven years, has been entering the stalemate process by the end of 2007.
MP Miroslav Jelicic, a company of Kristijan Floric, and founded the Australian Investment Investment company, has shared the expectations for the future of Croatia.
Southeast European Times: How do not decrease investors after the situation in the Croatian investment funds in the end of 2007?
Miroslav Jelicic: The investment is not a lot of interest in the world.
It is very important for the participation of investment targets, and there is a lot of importance.
The stalemate in the Croatian investments sector is something that is expected to be expected after the seven years of a two-year growth rate.
We need to described it as a normal situation in the market.
The consequences in Croatia have been a way to represent the idea of insufficient investors as a way to reduce the debt and easy money.
SE Times: Do you think the basic reason for the rest of the market by the end of 2007?
Purko: There is a lot of stalemate: the Kosovo problem is a slowdown transition process, a slowdown transition process, EU standards and a lack of transparent market.
The rise in the value of the profits can be seen as a precedent of other reasons.
The November 2007 elections were one of the effects that have caused the market to fall. [Getty Images]
SE Times: What was one of the effects of the November 2007 parliamentary elections in Croatia?
Purko: The parliamentary elections will have a lot of stability due to certain political options that will create future developments.
Therefore, the stalemate in the market has been affected by all factors playing a role last autumn and the positive change of positive change.
The stalemate is also the stalemate in the US economy, which is the largest economy in the world.
SE Times: Do you think that the information on the external and investment funds in Croatia is in general, the information on the market of people in the EU is more complicated than the information that they have people in the international community?
Purko: Everything more people in Croatia are seeking to see their consumption as a long-term investment.
Croatian investors now have a geography.
This could be positive or negative, but many are closed with a psychological poll.
We do not know that investors in Croatia are more than in the EU, because the market is more new.
In other markets -- such as the Croatian market -- the new situation in new markets -- is preparing for new investors, and the future work is prepared.
SE Times: How did the Croatian market started preparations to join the EU in 2009 as planned?
How do you reflect investment funds in the sector?
Purko: We can say that Croatia is approaching EU standards, in terms of transparency, pension systems, bankruptcy sector and provisions.
In the past five years, positive changes have been very positive.
I think that Croatia will be an example for Southeast European countries.
SE Times: How would you benefit for Croatian companies or sectors to join the EU?
EU membership could benefit for Croatia &aposs agriculture and farm sectors. [Getty Images]
Purko: I think that the Agriculture and energy sectors are the way of the economy.
Croatian companies should be able to enter the EU because there are problems in food and energy sectors, such as food and energy sectors in the world.
Croatia is very big and the country should use these resources.
It is not possible to achieve consequences that are not enough reforms.
The future of the Croatian economy and successful success are in the administration.
The task of these authorities should create a plan that will allow Croatian companies and the country to improve the economy.
SE Times: How will Croatian investment funds continue to focus on market markets in other former Yugoslav republics?
Purko: Croatian investment funding is a major part of the business climate.
However, I think that Croatian funds have been a lot of time, because Slovenia and North African funds have been more successful in the region.
In this market, the market should not be included in the price of prices.
SE Times: How do you see the experience in this market?
Purko: We are facing problems such as a lack of transparency, lack of transparency and a serious price change, but these problems need to be more active.
The Australian Investment will continue to create new opportunities in regional markets, as well as the effective effects in the spring.
Regional market prices should be supported with a institution of culture and EU standards.

Turkey criticised Brezakia on Wednesday (June 9th) with the 1929 Security Council, which envisions new sanctions to Iran for nuclear programme.
The two countries recently signed a nuclear agreement with the Tehran regime and are willing to continue diplomatic initiatives.
"We supported the Iran problem [the nuclear dispute] since the beginning of the [nuclear dispute], and now we voted in the Security Council on Wednesday," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.

After several months of talks and controversial discussions, Russian gas company Gazprom announced on December 24th that the Petroleum Industry (NIS) has invested at least 500m euros to Serbia (NIS).
At the same time, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev signed political agreements on construction of the South Stream gas pipeline to Serbia and reconstruction of Serbia 'Bank' Dvvor gas facility.
Although Serbia has submitted a deal for the century, the Serbian government has repeatedly repeatedly rejected by some parties in the energy agreement with Russia.
Deputy Prime Minister and G17 Plus party leader Mladjan Dinkic said Gazprom has closed the real value of Gazprom, adding that the country could be able to pay 800m euros from the sale.
He said Serbia has not been unable to provide any confidence that the natural gas pipeline would be passed by its territory, adding that his party is likely to withdraw from the government due to disputes between the ruling coalition partners.
However, Tadic said, the decrease of oil companies, including NIS prices in the world, has dropped the value of value.
He also believes that the document, signed with Russian counterpart, believes that the documents would be enough to build a natural gas pipeline that would change Serbia 'economy.
Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said the South Stream pipeline "is very important for the Balkans" and that Serbia will transform a strategic foreign investment point and a two-point point for regional gas supplies ".
According to the agreements, however, the natural gas pipeline will not be certain until September 2009.
Despite the global economic crisis, some analysts say they can build the South Stream.
"The pipeline of the gas pipeline is very positive for Serbia, and the country will strengthen its traffic position, and it will help the pipeline on the oil sector," French Ambassador to Belgrade Jean-Francois Terzic said.
Serbia aims to reduce gas prices if Russia is built the South Stream pipeline.
Belgrade now has significant amounts of gas from Hungary.
If the new pipeline is applied from Serbia, the gas distribution could also win money.
