While Croatia is a member of NATO and the EU, he added, a historic dimension that was discovered by nearly a year ago would be transformed into the truth.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic was speaking on the expectations for 2009, but Mesic has failed to withdraw his words.
"At a time when it emphasised the stage of a serious crisis, politics must be made more seriously than every survey.
It should not be allowed to be allowed to delay a number of personal interests and more votes, but pressure to delay inevitable reforms should not be allowed to overcome the overall interests of our people.
Therefore, 2009 should be the most important responsibility, "he said.
Some companies, including strong banks and financial institutions, have started warning for years.

We will not be able to see the crisis before.
And we will protect us from foreign resources, and we will also have the crisis resources in the country.
In addition, we need to create a circumstances that will provide industrial, production and exports, "he said.
The government has already taken an important step to revive consumption security.
Sanader warned financial institutions that the plan could face serious consequences if they are implemented.
The Zagreb Bank announced it would increase interest rates by 0.5 per cent in late December to 1.7 per cent.
However, as a result of talks with the government, the bank has dropped the plan.
In the first time of 2009, the amendments affected the life of Croatian people have also made.
According to the Chamber of Commerce -- which took effect on January 1st -- opportunities, gas stations, and the main bus and the airport will be closed on Sunday (January 1st), all smaller stations in the airport.

Former Serbian president Goran Hadzic, who fled Croatia during the war in the former Yugoslavia, is still at large.
The Hague tribunal charged 14 counts of violations of the laws and customs of war against him on July 13th 2004.
Hadzic, who left his house in Novi Sad on July 16th three days ago, is still at large.
UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte has accused Serbian authorities on the path to arrest Hadzic.
The head of the Serbia-Montenegro Committee for Co-operation with The Hague tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said state officials have not been forced with Hadzic since September 2004.
Ljajic explained that Hadzic was in the history with his family and that he would surrender him, but there was no consequences.
The head of the Committee said he was falling with his family and that the Serbian government has no information on whether Hadzic is still in the country.
Local media reported that he was said to be hiding in a Orthodox monastery in the village of Irig Gora, where he was in the village of Irig, or in Bijela, near the Montenegrin coastal city of Herceg Novi.

Erdogan Campauction for New Political Movement in Turkey
The government, led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is pushing for the implementation of the current parliamentary system, as it is unefficient and model.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 03 / 02 / 05
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said Turkey must foster the presidency system to capture long-standing stability. [AFP]
Following the EU progress report on Turkey last year, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &aposs government to revive a long-awaited debate on the country &aposs political structure, calling for the implementation of a US agricultural system, instead of the current parliamentary system.
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek told lawmakers last month that a change would bring stability to Turkey, so that EU membership targets will be met.
According to Erdogan and other managers of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), the current 75 annual system is unefficient and bureaucracy that must be discovered, but no other.
It is not new.
In 1989, Turgut Special was made during the presidential presidency, but was rejected by Turkey, in which it was not ready for a US agriculture system.
Some AKP lawmakers, however, say Turkey must strengthen the judicial system as a priority.
According to the prosecutors, a head of the presidency that will be made without these reforms will be given a lot of authority and will harm democracy for the government to open a authority.
The main opposition Republican People (CHP) has criticised the plan as an effort to send Turkish politics.
Meanwhile, the head of the Turkish Association of Industry and Businessmen, Omer Suzmen, said the government is not in line with the country, urging the current parliamentary system to strengthen the current parliamentary system.
The early history, which could be taken into the post system, could be the end of April 2007, when current President Ahmet Necdet Sezer will end.
If the system is working at that time, Erdogan is thought to become a candidate for a letter to Sezer.
Turkey, meanwhile, also assesses the proposal that the EU would reduce the electoral code from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in a bid to boost the number of minorities represented.
Several parties in the November 2002 elections were under the current message.
The AKP won the vote, which won 35 per cent of the vote and won a part of the remaining parties under the 10 per cent threshold.
The government has acknowledged the need for a better representation so far, but it did not respond to the barricades.
"If the parliament will continue, the electoral code should be protected," he said.
"It could also have a formal formation for the cleaning of the political parties that are not selected in the parliament," he said, arguing that a lower barrier would create a division of parliament and jeopardise stability.
Analysts say at least nine parties won seats as a result of the amendment, would allow the coalition and bloc to be allowed.

The death rate of Children is higher than other groups in the countries where they live, as well as the survival expectations are 10 to 15 years.
Roma families are more children and they are sent to schools, if they are sent to school, they are sent to the majority.
Education and skills have less business opportunities, and potential employees are being discriminated by discrimination.
According to a new UNDP report on Wednesday, the BBC, five of the majority population states in Bulgaria and Serbia, Macedonia and Romania have lived under the poverty border, as many as three cases of Roma.
All ten Roma living in Romania live in the poor.
In Kosovo, only one of the ten Roma have a school diplomacy.

Following more than a year after the government approved the regret of parliamentary Vojvodina on Monday (November 30th).
The delay was dismissed by the constitution and the ruling coalition and the opposition members of both the ruling coalition and opposition members, which have found more powerful authority to the northern Serb province.
According to Serbian state news agency Tanjug, 163 of the current 163 lawmakers in the vote voted in the bill of 138.
The opposition is the main objections to the capital of Novi Sad, the largest city in Vojvodina, and that the province is allowing the office to open agreements with other parts abroad and establish its own Science and Art Academy.
After the Socialists' amendments adopted last month, Vojvodina is recognised as a autonomous province and a secure part of Serbia.
The amendments also noted that Vojvodina could open European zones and representatives in Brussels with the Serbian government, and Novi Sad is now recognised as a administrative centre, not the capital.
Despite the amendments, the opposition is not satisfied.
Former Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic Party of Serbia, says that a case on a referendum on the borders of Vojvodina is dangerous for the integration of Serbia.
The party plans to apply to the Constitutional Court on this issue.
Other officials do not share such concerns.
Vojvodina Parliament Speaker Sandor Education said the ruling coalition has repeated the political material, adding that it is only the beginning of decentralisation and region in Serbia.
The head of the Democratic Party of Vojvodina, Democratic Party leader Bojan Pajtic, dismissed charges that the new missile is part of.
"Vojvodina will have more autonomy, but still in other parts of Europe," Pajdic said in a statement.
Socialist Party leader and Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Dacic said the amendments were "the biggest renewal of autonomy after the year", as "the republics of Vojvodina" are successful.
He added that Serbia will not allow Vojvodina to be above its borders.

EU internal affairs ministers decided on Monday (November 30th) that Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia could travel to many of Europe 'part of Europe as of December 19th.
EU officials, who repeated the decision, said this is an important step in the three countries' European integration processes.
"Today, the decision reflects the European perspective of the Western Balkans and is a result of the intention of efforts to fulfil the requirements for visa liberalisation," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday.
European Commission (EC) Vice-President Jacqus Barrot said that the 27-nation bloc would "improve the liberalisation of Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian citizens," improve relations between these countries and the Union ".
Tobias Billstrom, whose country currently holds the rotating rotating EU presidency, described it as a "historic" decision.
Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian citizens, who want Christmas to celebrate with their friendly and relatives in the Schengen zone countries, said Billstrom.
It is the only biometric passport that citizens need to travel to all EU member states outside the Schengen zone -- Britain and Ireland, Norway and Switzerland -- to be an increase of all EU member states outside the United States and Ireland.
However, their visits should not be passed in a six-month period, but if they need the video.
Those who want to work during a long visit must also be able to get visa or work.
On Monday, the decision is not applied for Kosovo residents, even if Serbian biometric passports, because the countries have yet been recognised by all EU countries and have not been included in a visa dialogue with the Western Balkan countries, which began last year.
"This is a bridge and clear step towards European integration," Serbian President Boris Tadic said at a joint press conference with Barrot and Rehn in Brussels. "It is not part of the EU accession talks, but not as part of visa liberalisation."
Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who is convinced Skopje 'efforts to fulfil the visa liberalisation requirements, said his country is applied to celebrate the "reason to celebrate" and this day will be defined to the Macedonian history. "

One of the main symbolic symbols of Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriots seem to be eliminated by the end of this year, when the divided city of Nicosia began a barricades on Thursday (November 24th).
The barricades in the Ledra Street have been stopping for 40 years.
The first time was established in a campaign against the British administration in 1958.
Three years after Cyprus declared independence in 1960, clashes between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sides caused the closure of the Ledra Street.
Furthermore, the barrier was discovered in 1974, following Turkey &aposs response to the Greek Cypriot coup to the north of the island.
Since then, Nicosia, a city of Venice, has been divided among the communities such as the rest of the country.
The UN-led "Interim Hat" candidate for the Turkish Cypriot north and the Greek Cypriot south.
"We want the reunification of the country," Semavi Aff, deputy head of the Turkish side of KIs' KIs' Turkish side, told the AP on Thursday. "This country is much more than the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots."
The latest international initiative to reunify Cyprus ended in April 2004, when UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed reconciliation plan was rejected by Greek Cypriots.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots voted since the agreement, only the international recognition of the Mediterranean island joined the EU in May last year.
For more than a year, the talks between the two communities are very restricted.
In 2003, however, Turkish Cypriots opened four border crossings, allowing thousands of people to leave from one day.
The latest move is expected to return to the region, raising local trade with the possibility of opening new minutes and logistics after decades later.
Both sides of the business community are calling for their own authorities to open the street.
"The plans are ready," he said. "It will provide economic benefits for both sides who live in this city."
"This is a sign of hope that there is a very much optimistic optimism in the political front," a local diplomat told Reuters on the move.
Greek Cypriots welcomed the surprise move and said they will do the same.
"If they open the entities, this is a good approach," said Romanian Cypriot Mayor Mikalakis Zambis.
"We are awaiting the green light from the UN, which is a number of concerns on security," Zamras said in 1974, as he wants to see the possibility of unrest.
However, he stressed, "it is ready to open themselves" if Turkish Cypriots open the street.
In a separate development, the Turkish Cypriot government agreed on Tuesday to adopt a law aimed at boosting property problems with Cyprus.
If parliament passed from parliament, the law will allow Greek Cypriots to demand the extradition of property in the past 30 years if it does not only be used or not only as a result, or not a threat to the public order.

In 2006, Romanian Economy Reconstruction Says
Romania faces many challenges this year.
As the conditions are approaching the EU on Sunday, domestic companies have become more competitive in terms of competition.
As a result, industrial production and GDP growth was low.
The rise of violence last year has affected the economy, as well as energy prices.
Meanwhile, international circumstances have shown uncertainty. The rise of economic stagnation and Asian economies in Europe has caused a right trend to protective policies.
In this context, there are many things that Romania must meet its obligations to the EU and to fight local leaders in the world, which wants to meet its obligations and make it clear to the country on its path to membership.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 23 / 01 / 06
Local markets have to advance the new competitiveness environment for many local companies to compete in the EU, while local markets have to comply with market conditions.
Romania is a risk to exchange its economic performance in 2006.
Nevertheless, the overall situation is possible to say on certain issues.
The local economy is in line with the circumstances.
In 2005, industrial production was low by the previous year.
The first nine months of increase is only 2 per cent, but the GDP is not expected to cover 4 per cent of 2005.
These negative consequences could be linked to violence and geography, which has been affected by the country.
In Romania, the industrial, especially in certain sectors, the increase in energy prices, the increase in energy prices, and the rise in state support has been affected by the competitiveness requirements, especially when the country lost a serious value of its currency.
As general, local markets have to comply with market conditions in the EU, many local companies have to comply with the new competitiveness environment.
This is a low increase of production and GDP growth.
How will local firms continue on the road in the coming period?
Do you think that the intellectual production has been emphasised, or that decrease will continue to be more time?
Recent wealth and heavy flows affected the country 'economy last year. [AFP]
If the alalt border has not been achieved, we can recognise the figures in the coming months when the figures are more false.
Despite the border, however, the demonstrations say it is not possible to be in the second quarter, but industrial production in 2006 could see a greater increase in industrial production.
It will also contribute to the process of improving the hospitals' sympathy, which will affect the increase of GDP.
This year, the hospital showed a very serious drop of 12 per cent compared to 2004.
But the optimism is difficult to wait a optimism if the production winners of 2005 are relatively low.
The trade deficit continues to increase in 2005, while the current account deficit could be on 9 per cent of GDP.
GDP and industrial production rates have a question that must be slowed by slowing the rise of growth: how such external deficits could be sustainable?
In addition, there are many circumstances that need to be clarified on the external deficit increase.
This year, the low production gains are in a mechanism that I would be able to stay on the main competitiveness problems.
The economy has to deal with an important increase in foreign currency ("Netherlands", due to the serious amount of money from Romanians working abroad and the risk of Romania to join the EU.
Observers do not see the need for foreign deficits, as the "normal" increase in bank loans and a long-term and safety loan in the banking sector.
But some allegations have borders.
The Real economy is not the only way in the economy, and the process of a couple of cycle is unavoidable.
If such an arrangement is entering the process, the foreign currency will also be serious, and this could be able to restore inflation.
The National Bank will give the test of the inflation target as a new monetary policy regime this year. [NBR]
This year, the National Bank will give the test of the inflation targeting inflation targeted as a new monetary policy regime.
The process of inflation has not been convinced by the last four months of 2005, which was implemented by the regime of 2005, would be better to postpone the implementation of the regime.
The class will have to be very difficult: about half of the money that the measures are being made through the euro, and about half of the NBR is still under control of the money, and the interest rate is still at large and bankruptcy crowd, the NBR is still a huge target of 5 per cent to reduce its capacity to control the financial supplies.
The increase in the prices of Benzium and the inflation expectations of inflation is 6-6.5 per cent.
Last year, the first target was sparked by a major difference. The first target, which was 6 per cent before the tax rate was implemented, was 8.8 per cent.
In 2006, the public budget envisions a 0.5 per cent deficit, but on the basis of the GDP increase and inflation, especially those related to inflation.
They should be reviewed with a budget recovery, and the budget should be implemented next year.
In addition, more financing should be provided in infrastructure projects.
EU funds need to be a special trend to the use of higher capacity.
The investment rating in Romania could be rising, as the prominent issues are managing enough.
Other international circumstances are the sovereignty of uncertainty from the economic effects of various geopolitical conflict.
The rise of economic stalemate and other Asian economies in Europe and other parts of Europe is the greatest example of the Doha trade talks, which have moved to protect their domestic markets.
Asian economies will continue to be affected by basic goods and oil prices.
Although there are a large number of EU markets, these conditions will also affect the Romanian economy.
Furthermore, Romania must fulfil its obligations to the EU, so we will have the chance to join the Union if it is successfully successful.
The local leaders of the business and political world are responsible for defining national interests more concrete and open.
The EU has some international interests, but also has a series of national interests that have been classified with one.
This is the truth of the rules' decisions.
However, the challenges cannot be dismissed, could lead to delaying EU membership in the framework of the security arbitration. In 2006, the islands are high.

SETimes: What is the mission to declare your candidacy as the LDK president?
Isa Mustafa: I think the LDK will be good for candidates to be elected in a internal compromise basis.
Of course, I will be able to learn the mandate of the LDK presidency, to the interest of Sejdiu and all who claim he wants to be LDK leader.
I do not meet with the specialists who want to support the candidacy and want Sejdiu 'resignation.
I have no connection with public support.
SETimes: How do you think the LDK is discriminating from the ruling coalition?
Mustafa: I think there is no right.
The legitimate time has already been returned to many major jobs that the PDK has decided to dissolve the coalition, or EULEX intervened.

Mustafa: We will have a completely stable government that will have a short mandate through elections.
SETimes: How do you see the party nominated as president, and what is the party changed?
Mustafa: I think that the LDK should be more open with the new generation, which is in the party, young people, the party is in the new generation.
The new initiatives and ideas should be more open -- the LDK should be convinced that only the experience owners should be able to dissolve.
This should be done by providing enough personnel and information to make Kosovo a different way.
It is not a new discovery for this government, but in terms of implementation of the rule of law, the fight against corruption and poverty, to prepare economic programmes aimed at fighting corruption and unemployment.

Turkey began its membership talks with the Union in October 2005, but the process has been slowly on the pace of reforms and refusing to open its ports and airports from the EU member Cyprus due to its refuse to open airports and airports.
Another reason, the bloc insisted, insisting that it would be offered a "efficient partnership" instead of full membership in a country of several heavy networks, a majority of Muslim countries.
So far, Turkey has closed only one of the 35 negotiating chapters that must complete the candidate countries before participating.
Eight of the remaining 21 chapters, Turkey has been frozen since late 2006, due to its failure to normalise relations with Cyprus.
The EU said on Monday that Fund would "open new chapters this year" if Turkey fulfils the necessary conditions.

According to EU officials, the amendments are in accordance with the conditions of the bloc and a step forward in the right direction for its membership bid.
In addition, Ashton welcomed Ankara ’ s growing role in regional and international issues, calling Turkey as a "important partner" for the 27-nation bloc in particular foreign policy.
"Gul and friendly, relations between Turkey and the EU," he said, noting that both share peace and prosperity targets.
Davutoglu said his country wants to expand co-operation with the bloc on key developments that could affect both sides.
"We share this broad geographic from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean," the AFP quoted him as saying. "Turkey is an active policy and this policies are crucial to implement with the EU."
Another issue discussed Tuesday was the latest in attacks by members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), adopted by both the EU and the United States.
Earlier talks, he said his country would ask the Union to support its efforts to deal with the separate group.
The PKK is a serious threat to the EU, Davutoglu said on Tuesday.
Ashton acknowledged that a joint effort in the fight against terrorism organisations is needed.
"We must reinforce organisations that use the EU to finance money laundering and education activities," he said.

The government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis presented a four-year plan in parliament. [AFP]
The ministries of the New Democracy (ND), 15 days, presented four years in parliament at the end of a three-day session.
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, who began with the public administration, said the government would change the sale laws to sell the sale of public tasks to change low opportunities, instead of allowing citizens to use complicated forms to decide on preferred supplies.
He also said the ND will check public contracts and will form a new official to monitor the completion of projects.
The National economy is one of the main targets of the government, Karamanlis said, adding that by 2008, 5 per cent growth and unemployment dropped by 50 per cent annually.
To achieve these goals, the company tax rates will be reduced by 20 per cent to 25 per cent to 25 per cent.
The prime minister said a new fear would benefit from a tax in agricultural stations and the VAT from 18 per cent to 8 per cent to 8 per cent.
Karamanlis said his government will monitor an open and extraordinary policy that will bring public progress in the projects.
In the case of delay, Deputy Culture Minister Fani Palli-Petralia will be monitored, as alternative ways will cancel the project to build the main swimmer airport, due to delay.
Both the country and Turkey have made a significant split in terms of resolving the Cyprus issue, the new government said it would monitor the same foreign policy.
Karamanlis also announced that the military service would be reduced to six years.
In general, the defence budget will increase the education and cultural budget to 5 per cent of GDP.
The prime minister promised that the pace of hospitals and medical centres will be developed in Greece, and will also be given the option of electoral doctors.
Citing the problem of public security, Karamanlis said police officers will have to go to the Police Studies University, instead of taking training at the academic level.
Most of the lawmakers were welcomed.
Opposition party leader George Papandreou wants more detailed information about the government plans to find the necessary resources, but acknowledged support.

Some groups, however, may be acting with an ideological agenda.

"I can Turkish learn in Nerda?" Libyan, 22, said on Friday.
On Friday, 12 Libyan residents and demonstrators were one of the 12 Libyan islands and demonstrators that have been brought to Turkey in a bid to foster pressure on the crowd hospital.
In the first day of the Swiss' boycott, the river has caused damage to the river.
"They say that uncertainty can be a year, so I have to know their languages," a Judiciary said.
The exhibition was invested at the Euricenna Hospital in Istanbul, where Turkish flags, Libyan rebels and three renowned Turkish Islamic aid spectators that have brought them.
"I am very proud that the IHH has done.
I feel a real solidarity with Turkey, "he said.
A Libyan disaster campaign has launched a Libyan catastrophic aid campaign, which plans to bring 70 Libyan injuries to Istanbul.
"Our team was the first international NGO to disburse assistance in Bengazi," said Murat Bajaktar, an emergency assistance co-ordinator for IHH.
On February 22nd, the Assistance class reached four days ago, five days after the beginning of the unrest, and the Red Hospital reached.
This fast intervention took place at a time when Turkish leaders are trying to lose their responsibilities under NATO, while the Arab mosque tried to lose the poor and deaths of the Arab mosque.
Ankara announced this week that the airport in Bengazi has assisted the business of humanitarian aid and sent medical assistance to the city.
Ankara is working to protect a potential mediator with both Gaddafi and its rivers and maintain communications channels.
"Libya is a difficult situation for Turkey because an attack with the West will be criticised by the Arab public.
Turkey, meanwhile, will be recognised as a country that has invested in investments, while the crisis will be disappeared, "he said.
As part of this sensitive balance study, the aid deeps are another indication of the growing cultural and economic division of Turkey.
According to Bacf, these details are in the process of enlargement and operating in different circumstances in the Middle East.
"Turkey has the benefits for the most Muslim country, especially in terms of some Western aid organisations," he said.
However, he noted, the situation of IHH is more difficult.
Last May, last year, the role of the female Freedom Freedom Palace, which is trying to take humanitarian aid to Gaza, has dropped to the international politics.
Israeli soldiers have sparked the organisation 'Mavi Marmara tour and killed nine people, including IHH activists.
As part of the political impression caused by the death, the attack was targeted to violate the attack.
The Association has not rejected it, but Backi believes that the broadcast organisation has created a cautious example of other Turkish animals, which is geopolitical.
"The IHH has become a symbolic of their lives with the ideology, and many other Turks do not want to monitor this road."
He added that organisations from the Middle East have not been tolerated with the ideological bagle, in the authority of the Middle East.
The Haynel deeply showed that there is no ideological agenda, sparking his work in discrimination areas, including Japan and Haiti.
However, all of them do not have many importance at the Euricenna Hospital, one of the most prominent privatisation of the Bingradian islands in Turkey.
"Even people in the race are going to see us," he said. "They question whether we need a city."

"I am tolerated," said Petar, 55, a Belgrade lawyer.
Washington Calls to Kosovo, Standards Reconstruction
Following the future status of Kosovo, top US State Department officials said the province &
(VOA, The Washington Times, RFE / RL, Radio B92 - 05 / 02 / 04)
US officials said Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi should focus on the UN approval standards, rather than the future status of Kosovo, particularly on the possibilities for multiethnic.
Rexhepi, who arrived in Washington on Thursday (February 5th) to participate in the traditional National Dua Kahirman, met with Foreign Minister Colin Powell and Deputy Foreign Minister Marc Grossman.

The international community has made it clear that if the province is ready for talks on the future status of the province, it would decide on a revision on the implementation of targets in mid-2005.
"We emphasised the importance of the implementation of standards supported by the international mosque and co-operation with UNMIK to achieve this goal," US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said on Thursday.
Boucher said Washington continues to support efforts "to build a multiethnic and democratic society in Kosovo", as UNMIK and Holkeri is defined by the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 ".
He stressed that the US administration has not yet taken a position on the outcome of the status debate.
Rexhepi has not been found on dialogue with Belgrade.
At a meeting at the US Peace Institute on Thursday, the prime minister said the results of the latest elections in Serbia have not created optimism about progress in this area.
Rexhepi argues that the only area that Serbian and ethnic Albanians show good co-operation is organised crime.
"Unfortunately, this is a good example of how co-operation should be done.
Kosovo is the only transit, even as the final presence point, because organised crime, drug and human trafficking is the last point of its presence, many times Europe, "he said.
Nevertheless, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Thursday that the change in the Kosovo Constitution could be possible if the two conditions meet.
First, two of the assembly must ratify the amendments, and these changes should be in line with the UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
His comments came during a debate on the UN 'Kosovo report.

The 65-year-old Katolic donor, Adriano Franchini, said he was interested in moving a young woman to the Christian Christian Church in Izmir, after he ordered the Sen Antuan Church in Izmir.
He was speaking with him, while the young man, a wife nationalist who was a fierce nationalist, frozen from his brother.
Franchcho died.
However, the three Protestan mission, which was targeted earlier this year, was not the chance.
They were killed hours after a group of young people in the eastern town of Malatvia. In 2006, another Katolic donor -- Andrea Artor -- was shot and killed by a 16-year-old young woman, who was shot in order to leave.
Christians in Turkey are not only extremist Islamists, but also from ultranationalist nationalists, who are threatening their assets as a threat to national security.
In popular television stations, such as the "Watch of the Prosecutors", the missions are not revealed as those who are serving as the global forces to destabilise Islam and the Turkish national.
A television division is also a television station, Franchini said.
Those attacks, including murders in Basta Malatya, have shown Turkish people.
The majority Muslim but a secular country, Turkey is proud of religious tolerance.
The government and almost all political groups have condemned the murder of the missions.
For critics, however, these violence is a sign that Turkey is too far under EU standards for religious freedom.
Brussels has long complained that the country has not been fully protected by discrimination minorities.
According to the lawyer who represented the families of the missions, one of the incidents had relations with local police.
The Turkish interior ministry launched an investigation.
Lawyers Mehmet Ali Kolcak was complained in the indictment that everyone in the Turkish Community Community had been detailed and made detailed information on judges.
The group has become a target, Kocak said, adding that authorities are more interested in emphasising the actual crimes against the murders of the murder.
Orhan Kemal Cengiz, another lawyer representing the victims' families, has accused Malatya of continuing anti-pressure campaign that could help the attack on local media.
The missions include two Turkish citizens -- Necati Aydin and Ugugur Yves -- as well as a German language, Tilmann Gestern.
Suzanne, the wife of Gesterin, is not responsible for Turkish people who live in the life of extremism.
He said he wants Malatya to continue to live in the army with his children who are doing.
"Following this murder, people in the maximum arrived in our house to get the health.
We came to present our house to present the image.
I believe that Turkey is the secular system and justice, "he said.

Several tourists in Albania have begun beaches in the Adriatic and Ireland branches for the summer, dealing with history and beautiful book.
This year, when a number of popular popular holiday resorts have a regional book fair, hundreds of books have thousands of options.
The fair, organised by the Albanian Association of Studies (AEP), sparked two points to Albania after Montenegro moved to Struga and the Macedonian coast of Struga.
The fair, which participated in about 60 broadcasters from Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia, was presented to new data for Albanian books in the region.
During his visit to Luxj, Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic and his Albanian counterpart, Alfred Moisiu, also injured the fair.
The two leaders praised the relations between the countries and their countries, describing the fair relations as a sign that it is better.
"We support the initiative as a beautiful path to the two neighbouring countries' culture.
The initiative is under the framework of other political mechanisms.
Albania and Montenegro have to boost co-operation between the two culture, "he said.
The aim of the book fair is "to improve the atmosphere of tourism and to strengthen tensions", AAP head Fatmir Toci said.
Each year, the holiday resorts are not only for domestic tourists, but also for the country to regain their holidays and friends, "Toci said." We are a perspective to Albanian immigrants from countries in order to spend their holidays, and we have a lack of feasibility in the West countries, "he said.
The fair was supported by the regional administrative authorities, local libraries and house universities in the cities.

Macedonia to Report Campampau Finnish Experts
As part of its efforts to fight corruption in Macedonia, the country has been changed for the election laws or the better consequences of campaign finances.
By Marina Stojanovska for Southeast European Times in Skopje – 09 / 01 / 05
"We cannot see the fact that the political parties in Macedonia are spent only a month," said Zoran Jacev of the Macedonian Transparency Organisation. [File]
The Macedonian government decided to change the electoral code in accordance with OSCE / ODIHR recommendations for fighting corruption.
The most important changes are the financing of political parties during the campaign.
Parliament is expected to approve the law before the planned general elections for 2006.
According to the amendments, parties will have to keep their accounts and make a financial statement, making financial resources, as well as financial resources, who gathered and spending the amounts.
Nevertheless, this information will be published on a website, established by the National Election Commission (USK).
The donations from unidentified resources will be banned and will be reduced to open the polo account for the campaign.
In an important case, the parties that use illegal activities face the risk of the candidates' candidates' lists.
Experts believe the proposed supervised control is crucial for the enlargement of the parties and dealing with corruption.
"We cannot see the fact that the political parties in Macedonia have spent only millions of euros in a month," said Zoran Jacev of the Macedonian Transparency International. "No party does not express the public campaign and funding."
The amendments are aimed at changing the situation.
In the next 48 hours before the list was destroyed, the parties (at least 35 days ago) will have to open the pollution accounts and submit the USK to the Internet.
The delay of the proceedings will mean that the party must withdraw from the elections.
In addition to the website of the parties' financial information, the USK will have to take place on the website, as well as to the parliament and the National Authority Agency on 30 days before the vote was approved.
Meanwhile, the National Democratic Union of Macedonia, the Socialist Democratic Union of Macedonia, the VMRO-DPMNE, the Democratic Union for Integration and the Albanian Democratic Party of Albanians are expected to suffer their accounts for the first time.
The delegation will delay these parties' overall financial and intellectual activities last year.
In addition, the 2004 presidential elections will be noted.
The groups that have funded the territorial arrangement referendum last year will also be detained.
The prominent Turkish Roma Governor Says
The prominent Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk could be sentenced to three years in prison if he accused him of "Turkish identity in front of public opinion" on Wednesday.
(The Washington Post, Independent, RIA Novosti - 01 / 09 / 05; AP, Reuters - 31 / 08 / 05; RFE / RL -- 14 / 04 / 05; The New York George - 30 / 08 / 04)
Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk Armeni and the Kurdish massacre will be tried in December, controversial remarks that he said. [AFP]
No year ago, the prominent novelist who described prisoners in his country as "husband", faces prison sentences for now, as he said.
The Istanbul prosecution charged Orhan Pamuk on Wednesday (August 31st) for failing to defend his country &aposs national character for remarks about Armenian and Kurdish massacre.
"We were killed and 1m euros of Kurdish and 1 million Armenians were killed in these territory," Pamuk said in an interview with the Swiss newspaper Together on February 6th.
Turkey does not accept the allegations of genocide by Armenians in 1915.
In addition to the number of deaths, the country argues that all ethnic communities were killed in the internal warrant of the Ottoman Empire in 1923, when the Ottoman Empire was formed by the Republic of Turkey.
Pamuk, meanwhile, comments with the Kurds, are on the issue of decades of clashes between communities and government forces in 1984.
Though the deaths were appointed as "genocide", the commissions and politicians were discovered by nationalists and death threats, as well as some Turkish newspapers.
In March, a high-ranking official of Turkey &aposs Ispare has ordered Pamuk to meet and destroy the books.
About seven months after Pamuk was interview with the Switzerland newspaper, the Istanbul Prosecutors' Prosecutor 'Office decided to violate the country' penal code, and Pamuk accused him of "discovering Turkish identity".
The case could be sentenced between six years and three years in prison, which will begin on December 16th.
Turkey revised the penal code this year to meet international standards and meet EU membership requirements.
But writer and journalist associations say the amendments are insufficient.
Turkish laws are allowing authorities to imprison for the worst perception of "national interests" on issues, including the deaths of the 1915, Washington Post reported.
Pamuk "is only tragedy, conflict or problem, and we want to show that we have to deal with at least," writer editor-in-editor-in-editor-in-editor-in-intellectual Tomrul Pasaoglu said on Wednesday. "We have to talk about this."
Pamuk, 53, is one of the most prominent routes that Turkey has been able to have at least one generation.
The literature career began with the "Cevdet Bey and Studies" published in 1982.
Since then, the writer wrote, "White Kale", "Kara Kitbook" and "Benim Alim".
In May, Pamuk was nominated in the BBC Freedom Award for Samuel Johnson Award for the Samuel Johnson Award, a book "in Istanbul, the largest and functioning city of Turkey.
John Upce writes that Pamuk could be the "close candidate" for Turkey "for the Nobel award, in an article published in August last year by The New York George.
Pamuk is the prestigious peacekeeping award for the "Benim Alim Dublin" for the 2003 Industry "and the Association of German Investors and Kitler, which was presented in early this year.

Kosovo and Serbia plan to implement part of an agreement on free movement of people on 1 November.
The agreement was reached during the summer talks in Brussels for the EU.
Edita Tahiri, head of the Kosovo negotiating team, said that illegal vehicles should be changed with beaches that will represent the RKS and KS barricades in the post-independence Kosovo and UNMIK administration, in line with the agreement.
"We [the vehicles] are doing the value of the KS vehicles who writes," Tahiri told SETimes.
However, Tahiri &aposs Serbian counterpart, Borko Stefanovic, told SETimes that the RKS plates will not be allowed to enter Serbia.
The rest of the deal could be more difficult because the removal of the agreement was removed from November 20th to November 20th, including identities, identities, drivers and traffic insurance.
If Kosovo authorities are unacceptable, Stefanovic said, it would be the effects.
"This time, there is no reason for that time, and it is mutual.
Now the Albanians will be able to take their identity of Albanians in Kosovo, if they come to Serbia, Serbian authorities will be able to get their identities.
"The Serbian side has a obstacle," Tahiri said. "The Serbian side refused to monitor the concept of the free movement of movement, and we have a complex logistical problems that the EU rejected."
Tahiri said ID demonstrations should show a valuable paper for both countries and extent.
However, the conscription of this network is a problem.
"The Serbian entity insists on the elements that do not comply with European principles, and they want more data and unacceptable challenges," Tahiri said.
"When it wants to prove that a individual is a person, it has shown that it is a letter of identification and enterprises," said Dan Zeka, the chief political adviser to Tahiri.
The rephotographs will not be photography in a letter to reputation, and it will only be the only one.
If the detention is unveiled, it must be a [meaning] that he is the most close police station and that he has lost it. "
Tahiri said this model was taken by other countries that have relations with neighbours such as Greece and Macedonia.
Kosovo analyst Belul Beqaj approves a doubt and tells SETimes that the agreements with Brussels cannot be implemented without "legal guarantees".
The only agreement, which is being implemented at this point, took place in the trade area on customs stations.
Other three -- free movement, women, astro archives and university diplomats -- are still awaiting implementation.

"The consequences of the implementation of the agreement on free movement of movement will be a poor for Serbs in Kosovo, because it is not a bad balance," said Bogle Koljevic, director of the New Serbian Policy Thought.
"Kosovo Albanians will be able to move on the territory of Serbia, and Serbs -- will not have such a movement," he said.
These agreements have been signed by the Serbian side, "he said.

The Abli, a small code in western Turkey, has begun to seek alternative energy methods three years ago, after the state has been used to produce electricity from agricultural bills and elsewhere, due to unpaid electricity bills.
Of the 365 people, 365 people have refused to pay the bills for economic reasons and the local government.
After the incident, columnist Mustafa Cicek has proposed to build a wind power generation to produce energy.
"This was a small value of 200 years ago and I think we can build a new value that will produce energy for water pump," Cicek told SETimes.
Cicek moved the idea to the Bursa municipality, and they have met with the sculpture.
"They were very beyond," he said.
The municipality of Bursa and the Ankara energy company Soyut Construction and Company began to build wind power staff in July 2008.
They worked as volunteer in the construction, and the government and Soyut did not reveal the authority and equipment for work.
The 50kWt energy producer goes to 210,000 TL.
The state has offered 140,000 TL, while the rest of the money has fulfilled the public.
Following the wrestling, the villages are waiting for two years to allow the wind power network to connect the state electricity network.
"We have to expect the laws to change.
While the former law suggests that we cannot connect the wind power network of the state electricity network, authorities in Ankara said they have changed the laws, "he said.
Turkey, a country that has a huge current current account deficit, which has a huge current account deficit, is seeking to produce more energy on its territory.
"Turkey is now developing its first local producer wind building," one of the local media.
The project has been named by the National Red Energy Initiative project and will be operational next year.
Further residents will not have to wait until the wind energy service began to produce energy.
According to Cicek, every kind could be operational.
They predict that they will save 200-300TL per year, as the wind energy service.
According to former Muhtar Ahmet Alp, some environmental villages show interest in building their own wind energy.
"[File] from Iznik] arrived in a crowd of 30 minutes," Alp told SETimes.
In the 1970s, the Foundation was the second largest village of Yenguei, but now one of the small villages in the region.
Most of the young people have entered Bursa to work and work, and the villages are around 65% of the villages.
The residents hope to attract more young young people to the Abik of wind energy.
"The Socialist, 31, plans to transport from the village, but it decided to stay because of wind power," Cicek said.
In the next few years, the Foundation is planning to change the existing energy service more.
"We want to build a green wind energy to sell other villages in the region," he said.
Turkey, Armenia take steps towards end dispute
Turkey and Armenia will start talks on two protocos, which has long been crowded, with Turkey and Armenia.

Turkey closed the Armenia border in 1993. [AFP]
neighbouring Turkey and Armenia agreed on Monday (August 31st) to launch talks aimed at normalising relations, taking steps towards the end of the almost decade.
The decision was announced in a joint statement by Turkish and Armenian foreign ministers following bilateral talks in Switzerland for months.
According to the announcement, protocos signed within six weeks after the negotiations were completed, will be presented to the approval of Turkish and Armenian parliament.
"Both sides will do their efforts to move forward in accordance with the constitutional and legal procedures," the Swiss' mediator said in a joint statement.
Turkey is one of the first countries recognised by Armenia in 1991, but the two countries have not established diplomatic relations.
The army borders have been closed since 1993, when Turkey closed its former Soviet republic to support ethnic Armenians in the Azerbaijan 'discrimination zone of Azerbaijan' ethnic Armenians.
However, the most secular problem between the two countries is due to the transfer of several Armenians who had 1.5 million in Turkey from 1915-1917 to 1917.
Armenians claim that the mass massacre is a genocide aimed at the eastern part of Turkey, while the idea has been supported by many Western historical and politicians, but Turkey is opposed to violence.
Turkey has acknowledged that thousands of Armenians have been destroyed during the weakness of the Ottoman Employment, but the number of victims were increased and deaths of the World War II.
In an interview published Monday by Armenian President Serge Sarkisan, the BBC said a solution to the Russian Service would not be a precondition for normalising relations between the two countries.
"It is important to find the reality of history.
It is important that our countries can build normal relations.
It is important that this is not repeatedly repeatedly repeated in the future, "he said." But we see the recognition of genocide as a precondition for creating genocide. "
The US State Department welcomed the announcement Monday.
"We are urging Armenia and Turkey to move forward in accordance with the framework," State Department spokesman Ian Kelson said in a statement. "We continue to work closely with both governments to support a historic process that will contribute to peace, security and stability in the region."
The two countries began a visit to Erivan last September, when Turkish President Abdullah Gul made it clear to Erivan and Sarkisian was unprecedented to the World Cup preliminary qualification between their national football teams.
He will visit Turkey on October 14th, when the two countries will play a preliminary interview between the World Cup.
However, the Armenian president said he could cancel his visit to Ankara if a concrete progress on the restructuring of the joint border is not made.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said a decision on the border issue has not yet been held.
"For this, it must be a long time," Davutoglu said in a Turkish NTV television on Monday.

A total of 700 people -- including the population of Kruba Voice, a close to Prizren on the Albanian border -- were 82 tonnes and 145 house -- were killed and killed 70 per cent of Serb forces (114 March) in March 1999.
Officials have already been able to identify only 23 people so far.
About 2000 people have been losing since the war -- and 91 people are among those in the village of Kruba Voice.
Still, six Albanian men have managed to flee the massacre of the massacre.
One of the foundations, the camp Sehu, lost two son, three brothers and seven cities.
Together with the diagnoses, the Makinian diagnosed.
Two of the atrocities committed to the massacre Voice massacre were witnessed to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in The Hague.
Today, Krurua Voice is a typical Kosovo village, where they are the majority of the population.
In the village where 70 per cent of the men were killed or lost, women have to restore their families and increase their children.
Domates, explosives and firefighters are selling on the Prizren market.
Most of the family has been spent with social aid from 45 euros a month ago.
Agron Limani, 41, a electricity engineer, writes a book about the incidents in the wartime Kruba Voice, in order to announce the needs of flags and mountains.
The living conditions in the village are very difficult, Limani says.
People 'power is not only to get basic food materials, such as relatively, supervision and architecture.
"We have always been parallel," Limani said, adding that "a local company would be more beneficial to create a small enterprise that would create the jobs."
"There were many of the women and children in poverty," said Limani, who fled the poverty of one of the worst atrocities in Kosovo.

In 2006, the Kosovo National Assembly passed a law that envisions special funds for gas and the wartime civilian victims.
The payments began in March 1st 2008.
In July 2007, the government began preparing a draft law on the families of missing people.
Local and international organisations are helping to prepare the law, representatives of missile families and those who are losing.
The bill envisions increasing the right to learn, education and information.
In addition, people are also scheduled to be given the right to determine the losses of losses.
Authorities have been very serious to ensure the authorities will be judged.
The Institute for War and Peace Relations (IWPR) said the families have asked their families to comply with the rights of 54 Serbs and two Roma, as they are responsible for the end of March 1999.
The families, encouraged by local NGOs, have signed a declaration in Kosovo, paving the case at the Pristina regional court.
"So far, justice has been justice for war in Kosovo so far, but the losses are not able to benefit the same, because the losses are not an incentive to prove crimes, and also a simple indictment," said IWPR, a lawyer at the Belgrade Centre for Humanitarian Law.
The IWPR said supporters and their families will replace the justice, even if war crimes were sentenced, and at least, Kosovo Serbs believe it will be able to return to the region.
The war crimes cases are still under way.
The new European mission in Kosovo is to focus on judges and prosecutors.
These cases that have been expended over ten years will be one of the most difficult tasks.
However, the families of men are seeking a clear signal that they will not avoid justice before everyone.
"The Justice has not yet finished," Limani said.

Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who took office in May, has a very urgent problem on the agenda.
These include the long-standing name dispute between Greece and Macedonia, the starting date for EU membership talks and implementing visa-free travel.
In addition, the president is trying to close the fall between ethnic communities in Macedonia.
In an exclusive interview with SETimes correspondent Goran Trajkov, Ivanov discussed plans and policies.
SETimes: After the president, you began to defend a "logical consensus" with Greece on the name issue.
Do you reconciliation?
How do you support the change of the name of Macedonia?
Gjorge Ivanov: Macedonia is very good recognition as a country that includes consensus and peaceful solutions, and foreign policy is also part of.
Therefore, Macedonia continues its commitment to dialogue and reconciliation strategies, which will bring our neighbours and friendly friendship, co-operation and prosperity to the entire region.
We have revealed a political will because Macedonia wants to leave the problem.
Our partners and our allies in the EU and NATO, as well as many Greeks know that a simple reconciliation would not provide one of our countries.
The reason is that a true and limited untrue is not a real alliance or friendly.
Therefore, all solution to the future and reconciliation are "unless our people do not respect the identification or respect for the identity of our people," he said.
However, such reconciliation with the traditional traditions, values and identity of our people could be considered by the country &aposs political leaders.
SETimes: What is the role of Macedonia in regional co-operation?
Ivanov was an important element of stability and security in the Balkan region and continues to be.
We are continued to boost co-operation with all our neighbours, and our active role in regional initiatives, we think that our country is more powerful and stronger, and that is supporting the security and development of the entire region.
Ivanov is trying to close the fall between ethnic communities in Macedonia. [Tomislav Georgiev / SETimes]
SETimes: Do you expect a date to start talks soon?
Ivanov is strong to the leaders of Macedonia, the leaders of all political elements and the entire society to the EU integration process.
Our country has shown great political will in the process, and we have already been under continuous reforms in our society, and has reached the highest European standards in many areas.
Macedonia has a strong political will and determination, as well as its institutional capacity to complete the process.
SETimes: The European Commission recently gave Macedonia the green light on the removal of the visa regime.
How do you expect this decision to create an effect?
Ivanov has a very positive impact on Macedonian citizens' European life and license.
The citizens of our citizens, companies and institutions have opened their doors for co-operation in culture, education and trade.
This is important for the society to be more European.
The new development has even increased prospects for the discrimination of the society, functioning market economy and even foreign direct investment in the country.
I believe that this society has achieved a long and sustainable development and is a strong step in the process of EU integration.
SETimes: You recently visited Croatia in the process of EU accession talks.
What is the main topics that we meet with President Stipe Mesic?
Macedonians who are awaiting for visa liberalisation at the Greek Embassy in Skopje.
The country will begin visa-free travel next year. [Getty Images]
The official visit to Croatia is very proud, while I do not have an official visit to Croatia.
Macedonia and Croatia have traditionally traditionally traditionally, and there is a past with many processes in the region.
Our countries show a common commitment to regional co-operation and full Euro-Atlantic integration.
In an effort to promote economic co-operation to Croatia, a major businessman is also on the ground.
I think that the relations between our business circumstances will be further strengthened by the two countries.
SETimes: How do you plan to eliminate ethnic divisions in the Macedonian community?
Ivanov is a European and Macedonian value for long culture.
Furthermore, mechanisms for the protection of ethnic, religious and cultural identity of the communities in the Macedonian Constitution are an extraordinary solution and a parliament for every modern society.
The Ohrid Agreement has made a strong framework for our country and the unity of our citizens, and strengthened the respect of the Macedonian community.
As for the presidency, I am working to promote confidence and co-operation between all initiatives, projects and activities [and] different communities, as well as the citizens of different ethnic and religious communities.
In addition to our political leaders, I will have to support all stakeholders in our society, as well as to support these values, because I will always emphasise the real identity and real power of the Macedonian community.

Serbian lawmakers are in the process of preparing a declaration condemning all war crimes committed on the former Yugoslavia.
The document is scheduled to be completed on Tuesday (June 14th) and is expected to discuss the declaration at the extraordinary parliamentary session this week.
The parties, however, have not reached an agreement on the final contention of the declaration.
The Democratic Party of President Boris Tadic has insisted that it is also part of a case condemning the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
According to Radio B92, others argue that Serbs are also committed to war crimes against Serbs.
In a meeting last week, party representatives agreed to "condemn all crimes committed during the wars in the former Yugoslavia and urge the authorities in Serbia to investigate and bring all individuals believed to be active and effectively effectively, to investigate and justice."
"The crimes committed against civilians in Srebrenica and Bratunac should not be reminded only in the anniversary of the years of crimes against civilians," the bill said. "The Serbian Parliament has never been condemned and that all countries of the region should not be condemned and war crimes during the former Yugoslavia".
According to Serbian Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic, "the highest state officials are to condemn war crimes and change the fact that people are talking about crimes," according to Serbian Parliament Speaker Predrag Markovic.
"I believe that we are approaching this," Markovic said in his remarks.
Serbian Constitutional Court head Slobodan Vucetic said the declaration was a political action and would not have any legal effect on the Serbian judiciary or a concrete impact on their work.
According to Vucetic, the document will be "a strong political and individual message".
The response to the rise was mixed.
Some NGOs and actions say the document does not meet the need.
Speaking at a conference on the Srebrenica massacre on Saturday, Humanitarian Law Centre Director Natasa Candic said the bill, described as "harmful", shows that the institutions are still not ready to deal with the past.
Meanwhile, legal professor Vojin Dimitrijevic criticised the parliament 'initiative as "triggered".
He said such a declaration should be approved five years ago.
The assembly came after a video tape showing the murder of six Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica was released on Serbian television.
Croatian police announced on Tuesday that a person believed to be among the members of the paramilitary group, which was believed to be included in the type.
The Serbian government has also detained several former Alos officers who have been charged with murders.
EU Commissioner for Enlargement Relations
EU leaders met in Brussels on Thursday for a key summit and will not discuss further enlargement of the Union.
The declaration, which will be signed on Friday, is expected to be made in part of the decisions made in the previous meetings.

EU leaders are not expected to discuss further expansion of the Union as different than previous practices during their two-day summit in Brussels on Thursday (June 16th).
The final declaration, which will be published at a high-level meeting this week, will only be repeatedly on the commitment of the EU to make decisions on the issue, according to diplomatic sources.
At a meeting in Brussels, the leaders of the 25 member states met for the first time since French and Dutch voters voted in a referendum on the EU constitution.
The verdict was largely interpreted that voters reflect their dissatisfaction with their own government.
However, the public is worried that the Union has been faltered, the factors that have led to the end.
The first expansion was included in the interim agenda of the Brussels summit.
However, EU foreign ministers decided on Monday that the expansion has lost popularity among some member states, and agreed that a debate should be avoided from the controversial meeting in Luxembourg.
For all of the issue, the ministries have been decided to be seen as a negative signal by both potential member states and the financial markets, the ministers have decided to reinforce a general case on expansion.
"The Council of Europe reaffirmed the results of enlargement on 16 December and underlined the need for implementation of them," Reuters quoted the bill as saying.
The EU leaders said the date for Turkey to start accession talks on 3 October, calling it to meet economic and political reform commitments, as well as the requirement for signing a protocol extending the customs agreement with the Union to ten new member states, including Cyprus.
The EU foreign ministers reportedly approved the protocol metres on Monday and sent the document to Ankara.
Now Turkey has signed the document within weeks, and Brussels is expected to fulfil all requirements for the start of accession talks.
Another candidate country is on the progress of Croatia and its full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
EU ministers promised on Monday to restore the issue of Croatian membership talks at a meeting on July 18th.
They also urged Zagreb to boost efforts to implement the action plan aimed at resolving the issue of fugitive war crimes indictee Ante Gotovina.
Slovenian Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, told reporters that Croatia has made progress in achieving full co-operation ".
Bulgaria and Romania are seen as the candidate countries who are worried about the latest "no" votes for the EU constitution.
The two countries, which signed participation agreements in April, are scheduled to join the Union on 1 January 2007.
In the recent days, however, calls for delaying membership.
The enlargement process should be slow, EU Enlargement Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner said in an interview published by the German daily Bild on Sunday.
"We should always recognise our citizens," the commissioner said. "We must do everything, but my idea is to reduce the pace of enlargement."
However, European Commission Vice-President Gunter Verheugen told the German Inddeutsche Zeitung that Bulgaria and Romania are among the priorities of the Union.
Verheugen, whose EU enlargement commissioner has been expanded by last year, stressed that the process should continue despite the referendum results, warning that stability in Southeast Europe depends on.

UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan "special envoy Kai Eide arrived in Pristina on Monday (June 13th), the process of assessing the implementation of democratic standards in Kosovo.
The international community is a preliminary standards for the start of talks on the province &aposs final status.
At a meeting of the Security Council in late May, the Council decided to begin the start of a review, as many of the members of the Council agreed to begin a more detailed report on the implementation of standards.
Eide is expected to complete its report in Kosovo in about two months.
He and his team will prepare a report on the development of political processes in Kosovo, focusing on relations between ethnic communities and decentralisation process.
A positive report will initiate the process of resolving Kosovo &aposs final status, the process of resolving its final status in late September.
"The implementation of Standards is only one of the components and will be held on a broad assessment of the situation in Kosovo, as Annan is requested," Eide said in Pristina. "I would like to talk about the situation in Kosovo to talk and talk about people, so that I will be the best to talk about what they are here."
Eide will arrive in Belgrade on Wednesday, after meeting with Albanian leaders and UNMIK representatives in Pristina, where he will meet with top Serbian officials.
Nevertheless, EU ministers met in Luxembourg on Monday, acknowledging a document that recognises the Union &aposs future role in Kosovo.
The document highlights the province &aposs future status should be based on the protection of minorities and cultural monuments of minorities and a efficient fight against organised crime.
In addition, there should be no "division" on territory, or not united with another country.
The Union announced it would appoint its own Kosovo envoy to co-operate with other diplomats that have been concerned.
"We need co-operation in Pristina and Belgrade.
We are talking about minority rights in different places.
Therefore, these issues should be transferred under the EU 'image, "he said.
Kosovo has been under UN amendment since June 1999, when NATO was forced to withdraw military and police forces from the province, following a three-month bombing of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
According to UN report, there are great differences in the region
Cyprus will be the most happy country in Southeast Europe, according to a UN survey. Bulgaria is among the world &aposs most satisfaction.

Greece, which frozen over several months of bankruptcy, was ranked 42nd countries in the world. [Reuters]
Cyprus and Greece are the most happy countries in Southeast Europe, according to the first World Capital Report on April 2nd, published by the Cnegative University in New York.
The survey, covering 156 states over the world, was made by a high-level UN memorial conference in New York on the same day.
"The GDP has long been serving as a destination of economies and politicians.
Nevertheless, progress is not in account for social and environmental costs, "he said.
The conference called for the idea of using the idea of national prosperity and good governance in 1972, which was born in 1972 and hosted the conference.
At the time, the smaller Himalia search began to use the GDP Instead of GDP (GDP).
According to Richard Layard of London School of Economics, Richard Layard and the British University in Canada, John Helliwell, who prepares the World Capital Report for Committee, Jrey Sachs, the winners in GDP are not the only way.
The United States, which ranked 11th place in the world, has increased three times since 1960, but the idea of a happy team has been "stopped, Sachs said at a UN meeting.
"Other countries are monitoring other policies, gaining more achievements in terms of satisfaction, even though they are very low levels of revenue," he said.
The report, based on various national and international surveys between 2005 and 2011, was Cyprus ranked 35th, and is the highest country in Southeast Europe.
Last year, Greece was the crisis in front of 11 other countries in the region, while Greece was ranked 42nd in front of 42nd.
"The last 2008 and 2009 could be used by the crisis," said Dr. Maria Simosi, a professor of Organisation for Organised Crime Teori and the Team and Information Charter, told SETimes.
"However, Greeks can continue to receive high score from other similar countries in the economic crisis, if the social compensation remains high."
Unemployment, which caused the death or death, has been on 21% since the crisis in Greece began, according to the UN report.
Asked to comments about the country &aposs best position, Helliwell said the ranks are "based on average points by 2007 and 2011, and the possibility of reflecting current incidents".
"We hope that the amendments of the period will be prepared and we hope to prepare a conservative report," Helliwell told SETimes.
Among the 11 other regional countries, Croatia, Kosovo (6th), Moldova (75th) and Turkey (78th) ranked 56th in front of Turkey (7th).
Romania will rank 80th in the world, while Montenegro (8th) (86th) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (9th) were other countries that have failed to enter the first 100 in the region.
Serbia and Macedonia ranked 118th and 127th, while Bulgaria (147th) ranked eight Africa countries and eight Africa countries in front of Haiti, a fear earthquake in 2010.
Deputy Assistant Professor Zaharina Savova, a clinic psychologist and psychologist in Sofia, has not been surprised to Bulgaria &aposs lowest position.
People are happy when they can achieve their targets of forests or society, he said, adding that if people do not do in their lives, it should be accomplished with internal eastern.
"Bulgarians are always going to complain and see the negative side of the incidents," he told SETimes.
"We fear the discovery of the cycle, which is why we cannot live fully."
In the study, Denmark, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands ranked the world as the most satisfactory countries in the world, with the assessment of the average life of 7.6 points in a 0-10 square.
Togo was the worst country after the Central African Republic and Sierra Leone, which participated in the survey.
The average score of the four countries in Sahra was 3.4.
"The more happy countries are to be more rich," the report said, adding that the revenue of four countries in the worst four countries is 40 times high.
However, they can be able to trust among the more important factors for peace, freedom of movement, health care and corruption are not expected in the elections, he said.

Adriatic Group to regional security co-operation
Regional defence leaders have pledged to find a joint approach to Euro-Atlantic integration and a solution to common security problems.

The Adriatic Group efforts to boost regional security co-operation and a joint approach to the Alliance ahead of the next month 'NATO summit, analysts say, is a step forward to analysts.
The Adriatic Group -- Albania, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- signed a declaration last month that NATO wants to continue its "open door" policy on the accession meeting in Chicago.
"NATO is the best guarantee of regional security.
Regional countries in the region are working together for the progress of defence skills and the lack of pharmaceutical procedures, "he said.
Pande Lazarevski, an analyst at the Institute for Apavel Shatev, told SETimes that the declaration shows that countries in the region are ready to join the Alliance as a regional group.
"The preparation for entering the extreme defence system is a key step in the accession process," Lazarevski said.
The candidates for NATO members Croatia and Albania are also equally important, he said.
"Croatia and Albania see a broad benefit, but still in the Adriatic Group, the Adriatic Group is still on the way of political solidarity," Lazarevski added.
Military and security analyst Petar Shkbina told SETimes that the conference in Skopje is also aimed at preparing the basis for Kosovo and BiH to join NATO.
He said that this is not a reason for Serbia to join the meeting.
"US Secretary of State has announced that Kosovo must become a candidate for NATO membership.
This plan should soon be transformed.
Agim Ceku arrived in Skopje with the Kosovo Defence Minister, "he said.
"The candidacy of BiH will be a problem because of the status of Republika Srpska," Shkbina said.
"Kosovo is ready to help build regional security and stability, and it is time to participate in reality," Ceku said at the conference, voiced regret that Serbia does not participate in the meeting.
As Greece has created security balance that Macedonia has blocked NATO membership, the group also asked Macedonia as part of the declaration to join the Alliance as soon as possible ".
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov has asked NATO to regain its decision by the 2008 Bucharest Summit, which it has complicated Greece 'demands.
"Macedonia is pushing all membership criteria and NATO countries must take into account the ICJ decision that Greece has blocked its membership in the Alliance, blocking international laws," Ivanov said.
He said he hoped Greece would comply with responsibility for the 1995 interim agreement with Macedonia.
"This is the most important solution.
The interim agreement says Macedonia could join international organisations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ", the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".
Greece accepted this decision, "he said.
The group also said steps must be taken to ensure a multiethnic air defence.
The group also called for joint regional projects, such as a network of regional shield equipment, and improving co-operation in all education centres and natural disaster.
"This is a clear determination to apply for NATO to use the current regional defence skills, which will reduce regional security and threats."
Former Macedonian Foreign Minister Srdjan Kerim said the next step that must be taken is to form a similar regional congress in North North Republic to develop energy, infrastructure, transport and environmental projects to boost defence consequences.
The model could be implemented, as some Balkan countries sell bilateral disputes that sell progress and take part in different projects.
Is the Croatian elections back for HDZ?
Is the ruling party in Croatia can find a way from the last scandals and play a nationalist card on Sunday?
By Drazen Remikovic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 02 / 12 / 11

The two main political groups, the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Forum coalition -- parties gathered in the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Croatian Social Democratic Party (HNS), the Croatian Peoples' Party (HNS), Istria Democratic Assembly (IDS) and the Croatian Pensions Party (HSG) will face Sunday (December 4th).
According to the latest public opinion polls, he has an important atmosphere against the HDZ in western corruption scandals.
Croatian State Election Commission (DIP) spokesman Hrvoje Sadaric told SETimes that the Commission has received reports on campaign financing and will prepare a report on any irregularities.
"During the electoral campaign, data showed that the previous parliamentary elections in 2007 have dropped compared to the previous parliamentary elections.
For the first time in this parliamentary elections, the law on the financing of political activities and electoral campaign has also increased electoral transparency, "Sadaric said, adding that around 4,000 registered observers will be monitored.
They and experts have described the campaign as a preventive, saying party platform and programmes are the same as the last campaign.
Boris Pavelic, a journalist at the Zagreb Novi List, told SETimes that the HDZ 'reelectoral campaign is impossible.
"The HDZ seems to offer nothing after all scandals that come to the day.
However, the model coalition has a major paramilitary because it is not to deal with certain problems such as scandals, "he said.
He emphasised the HDZ more national identity, while coalition leaders are trying to pull tensions and circumstances.
Zdravko Pejko, a professor of political scientists in Zagreb, described the campaign as "fear" and said the parties do not do nothing to encourage the people of the vote.
"I can say that in the previous years we have made campaign researchers, it is not only for political parties in Croatia, but also for ideology.
For example, a difference party is closer to the Catholic Church.
However, the health system, education and other social problems do not exercise ideology as more important, "he said.
He added that the campaign does not bring any new things, and stressed that Croatia will have a different government after the December 4th elections.
The party officials from the coalition are waiting good results, as the public is discovered by the government.
"[Some] the most elected government] may be unlikely to vote this time, and this could be a higher chance of optimism by the 2007 elections," Istria Democratic Assembly (IDS) spokesperson Dusko Kisson told SETimes.
However, the ruling HDZ continues to play a "nationalist boycott" in the vote, and polls suggest the diaspora would vote for the party.
"I am convinced that the HDZ has a traditional voters in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I am convinced that these elections will be successful.
However, turnout is low because of the number of polls' centres' decline.
However, there will not be no problem in Bosnia for HDZ, "he said, adding that about 300,000 BiH Croats who have Croatian citizenship are expected to vote.
HDZ seems to be fully opposed on Croatia &aposs EU accession process, while about 40% of the public still oppose EU membership.
Zagreb, Stevan Tripunovic, told SETimes, would vote, but that politicians will not be able to speak with the citizens, as the country joined the EU.
"It is the last time for a type of class.
I think we will feel that we will feel that we are entering the EU, "he added.
Zagreb retired Nadica Nadicic told SETimes that he would not vote because it is "more beautiful things to do" on Sunday.
"I have the right to use me.
Each government will be the same.
The selection will not be elected, the pension rate will not be made.
I cannot expect this election story, so we can end our battle with minimum ideas and recommendations, "he said.
Thaci wants US support for dialogue
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said in Washington that the Western Balkans still need strong interest and assets of the United States and the EU.

Kosovo analysts believe that a visit to the United States last week that Prime Minister Hashim Thaci is an important step towards continuing the role of tensions with Serbia and to protect Kosovo &aposs EU integration process.
Thaci visited Washington to discuss the role of Kosovo in the Balkans.
He met with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday (April 4th) with US Vice President Joe Biden.
Thaci asked the United States to continue its role in the entire Western Balkans, not only in Kosovo.
"Prime Minister Hashim Thaci Vice-President Biden has asked the United States to play this determination role and that Kosovo remains one of the supporters of the Euro-Atlantic structures," the prime minister said in a statement.
Biden reiterated the United States' support for the sovereignty of Kosovo and congratulated Thaci for progress in the inter-Belgrade dialogue with Pristina.
"The United States is strongly supporting dialogue and expects full implementation of agreements between Kosovo and Serbia that will benefit the people of both countries," he said.
After talks with Clinton, Thaci said all countries in the region share a joint goal on European integration and NATO membership.
"However, we still need strong interest and presence in the rest of the Western Balkans, not only in Kosovo, but in the rest of the Western Balkans," he added.
Kosovo and Serbia have reached a compromise that allows Kosovo to represent itself as "Kosovo" Kosovo "in regional talks, Dipta said." This name should not be a judiciary on the positions of the name status and the 1244 UNGK Resolution and the ICJ on Kosovo independence. "
The deal was initially delayed as a breakthrough that allows Serbia to gain EU candidate status, but representatives from both countries left the meetings due to disagreements on how Kosovo will be recognised.
Serbia announced on May 6th that the presidential, parliament and local elections would hold Kosovo.
Pristina has threatened to block the elections if it should be held within the borders.
The United States continues to continue its interest in protecting Kosovo 'territorial integrity, US Deputy Assistant Director and Operation Director Ibrahimi said.
"I think that the north issue should be resolved in the Kosovo entity, with the assistance of international friends and ensuring all rights in the north of the Republic of Kosovo, which should be resolved," Ibrahi told SETimes.
Ramadan Ilai, the founder of the Kosovo "Fol" (SP) Movement, says Kosovo politicians are always closed to the EU foreign policy, especially in Kosovo and Serbia.
"Kosovo has asked the United States to play a role in the latest talks.
This visit aims to confirmed the US support for Kosovo that Pristina and Belgrade will give the agreements reached in the inter-Belgrade dialogue, and encourage Thaci to continue the process, "he said.
The situation in northern Kosovo is unstable and a new interim agreement should be reached, and this should be a process that caused to include the overall system of the parallel system in the north, such as Gracanica and Shkov municipalities, "he said.

ICTY spokesperson Nerma Jelacic. [Nerma Jelacic]
Since 1993, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has been working to justice responsible for war crimes committed during the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s.
SETimes correspondent and war crimes defeat Nerma Jelacic talked about the challenges that the court lives in the past and the ongoing heritage.
SETimes: The ICTY is managed to bring war crimes to justice and dismantling the victims.
What is the biggest challenge the tribunal faced?
Nerma Jelacic: The court has faced numerous challenges since the first day of the establishment.
At a time when local courts will not be able to investigate and prosecution, the conflict was established in the middle of the conflict.
In this meantime, he faces a library, such as the management of the court documents, functioning and protecting witnesses, the executive of the detention and the protection of witness witnesses.
First cases were not beginning, there was a challenge such as complicated cases; it has to be a balance between the right of the defendant to a fair judiciary and the right to proceed as possible.
This challenge has increased by the end of the completion strategy, which must accelerate the courts, accelerate their behaviour in 2003.
The court 'mandate is to prosecute a slight proceedings that would also include operations that contribute to peacekeeping and stability outside the court. In 1999, the court established the first example of a communication programme for the international judiciary, in order to approach the work of the region.
Now, one of the biggest challenges is the legacy of the tribunal.
To complete the mandate of the tribunal, it is crucial to the continuation of its heritage even after the closure of its doors is closed.
SETimes: How do the judges in the ICTY fear their disappointment?
Jelacic: A judge is a judge to stay unimmunity and to meet the highest standards of the rule of law.
All judges at the tribunal are very professional and experience.
Judges' decisions are based on evidence submitted in the court.
SETimes: How do you think the ICTY will be the biggest effect on the work, or a case that is a return point?
Jelacic: Ozella, it is unable to choose a certain case.
All cases have played an important role in tackling the victims and make it a step forward and to tackle them.
And all, international penalties and humanitarian law have an important role in developing the law.
SETimes: How do you expect the ICTY to complete its tasks?
Jelacic: The tribunal is still under way to the latest Tamamp Strategy Report, which was presented by the UN Security Council last autumn.
The next report will be prepared in this year and the court is taking all measures needed to complete all the remaining work by the end of 2014.
After July 2013, all cases that will be appealed after July 2013, the International Criminal Tribunal for the International Criminal Tribunal for the next year will begin working for the ICTY in 2013.
In the second part of this interview, Jelacic said the ICTY is aimed at preparing local courts in the Western Balkans to be efficient to address war crimes cases.
EU urges pragmatim in Kosovo talks
Serbian officials allegedly continued dialogue with Belgrade -- and President Boris Tadic urged the removal of barricades in northern Kosovo, KFOR is trying to bring Serbia 'EU membership candidacy.

NATO welcomed Serbian President Boris Tadic on Thursday (December 1st) to call for Kosovo Serbs to remove barricades in the north.
"This proposal could contribute to reducing tensions.
KFOR, however, does not see that the positive proposal has a real effect, "he said.
NATO has urged both Kosovo and Serbia to co-operate fully with all international players to ensure freedom of movement and continue dialogue with the EU.
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said he had been direct clearing with Tadic and wants to work to affect barricades and affect violence from Tadic.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fulle met with Kosovo Minister for EU Integration Vlora Citaku in Brussels, saying the Union will continue to support Kosovo on visa liberalisation, removing Citaku to join the EU programmes and a trade agreement.
"I also stressed the importance of Kosovo to launch a comprehensive agenda for the north," he said.
He encouraged Kosovo to continue constructive relations with Belgrade ahead of a general session on Monday.
"Regional progress will be made, both Pristina and Belgrade will be closed to the EU, and will help them achieve their goals on Europe.
Both sides must be pragmatic, credibility and flexibility for the interests of the people of Kosovo and Serbia and the region, "he said.
Serbian Ministry of Kosovo Secretary of State for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic told SETimes that KFOR is trying to create a conflict in order to bring Serbia from its EU membership candidacy on December 9th.
"Serbia does not defend the interests of next day, but last July, when Pristina launched a unilateral action aimed at removing the internal affairs, Kosovo Serbs remain needed," Tadic said.
"We do not have a final goal, such as the barricades, but there is no answer to the question that the Judge and Brnjak will be removed," Zvecan Mayor Dragisa Malovic told SETimes.
We fear that Kosovo special police have come from the VMROSG, because it would mean that all relations with Serbia will end.
If our country is leaving our own own, it must say.
As hundreds of people, President Tadic has created this problem, when we repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly that Europe is not an alternative, "he said.
He said Kosovo Serbs need Serbia 'support because they do not have other countries from Serbia.
"This constitution is a constitutional problem and it must be interested in the president, and the mayors are here to prevent the public and unity," he said.
Bogle Koljevic, editor-in-chief of the New Serbian Political Code and editor-in-in-chief of the New Serbian Political Code, told SETimes that Serbia has a negative impact on its incompliance and unconsistent stance.
"Everything we have seen in the past months is that we have changed, and therefore we cannot be confident that Serbia is and that we have changed.
There is no doubt that all Serbs in northern Kosovo and the Serbs in northern Kosovo are not a part of the EU candidacy.
Although Serbia is a willingness to keep Kosovo and EU policies, it was impossible to see that. "
Koljevic has not been under pressure on Kosovo Serbs to decide whether they will be done later, because they should be repeatedly repeatedly and that their views should be taken.
He said all talks and agreements, held by the chief negotiator Borislav Stefanovic, are now damaged by Kosovo Serbs, who have to use Kosovo plates and go to an unprecedented name with Serbia.
Everything is important, he said, but Stefanovic rejected such a possibility, the Judge and Brnjak fears that Kosovo customs officers have reached an agreement to replace Kosovo customs officers.
The Serbian government, Stefanovic and his team have formed a Mesleki and Fiiliation Agency that would help improve the progress of the agreements and technical issues.
Aleksandar Jugovic, a member of the Serbian Renewal Movement, told SETimes that Serbs in northern Kosovo accept the proposals from Serbia and that dialogue is important for them.
"They are completely unnecessary, Kosovo Serbs are stopping their interests and Serbia 'interests.
Serbs must withdraw from barricades with the facility, because it would be a disaster for Serbs and Serbia in the south of northern Kosovo and Ibar, if KFOR will use its authority from the KFOR Kumanovo Treaty.
They should be removed, "he said.

Following more than a week before Serbia &aposs EU candidacy, Serbian President Boris Tadic has called on Kosovo Serbs and KFOR to pull tensions and to avoid weaknesses at the end of July, when local Serbs protest Kosovo customs duties between Kosovo and Serbia.
On Tuesday (November 29th), Tadic urged KFOR to end the barricades, urging citizens to jeopardise the risk of the operation, saying they are dangerous and that the situation in Kosovo is not contributing to resolving the situation.
"They are jeopardising that Serbia is helping to defend its national interests in Kosovo and Metohija, it is jeopardising them.
In addition to the fight against the rights of Serbs, the removal of the crowd and the improvement of transport and news, "he said.
At a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Thursday, Tadic also backed from EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Security Catherine Ashton.
"The violence in the north is very concerned, and I am very concerned about what we can make progress on the European path," Ashton said.
However, representatives of Serbs in northern Kosovo responded to the call for Tadic.
Kosovo Mitrovica Mayor Krstimir Pantic told SETimes that Tadic "was a surprised surprise in barricades and other Serbs in northern Kosovo" as of the time.
The decision on whether the barricades cannot be removed and removed, the representatives of the municipalities in northern Kosovo should not give their own own, he said.
Milos Z., a Kosovo citizens of Mitrovica, told SETimes that Tadic has not been calling for the removal of barricades, but has now been calling for it.
"We have been barricades for four months.
How do you think we need to withdraw from the cities?
How do you see us after the conflict with KFOR on September 27th? "
Milos believes that this is being made at the EU summit on December 9th, with pressure from the EU on Serbia ’ s potential membership candidacy.
"We are not fair to victims of us. We have been fighting to live in the state of Serbia for 12 years and we are now in a lot of alliance," Milos said.
Belgian analysts believe that Tadic is a major return in Kosovo policy.
"The call for Tadic is a final loss before December 9th, when Serbia will not get candidate status," Ian Bancroft, a founder of the Transparency Organisation that operates on resolving the conflicts in the Balkans, told SETimes.
"This is a designed process to satisfy the European countries, particularly Germany, who called on Belgrade to do more in the north of north, to do more," Bancroft said.
"Tadic is a message to the problem that Europe can give it more than in the north, especially in the so-called 'parallel institutions.
This latest initiative aimed at reducing EU voluntary volunteers is unlikely, and this will be bad in a electoral book, which views EU requirements for Kosovo, "he said.
However, Kosovo Compromise project director Alesandar Mitic said Tadic 'call is no surprise, because it is "harmful policy" that is under pressure.
"While calling for the removal of the families, Tadic called on him to destroy itself," Mitic said, urging him to show everything within the authority of any violence, but also to demonstrate that Serbs in northern Kosovo do not have any effects. "
According to him, the call was enough for Serbia to receive candidate status this month, but there is no special importance of the status status quo without a starting date for talks with the EU.
"However, Kosovo Serbs do not trust Tadic, and Pristina will continue to block its authority in northern Kosovo or this way," Mitic said.

The foreign policy, which has not been discussed in the elections for years, is increasingly important for voters.

Since the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002, the opposition parties played an important role in Turkey 'ambitious foreign policy agenda.
However, political answers over the past year in the Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) could change this trend.
Opposition party party party CHP has visited Washington at the end of March, visiting Guldan Bilgehan, Unet Oran, Faik Ozak and general leader, Faruk Loglu, who visited Washington by the end of the June 12th general elections.
After a series of meetings with congress and Foreign Ministry officials, Loglu, Turkey 'former US ambassador to the United States, told SETimes that "the highest level of interest has been met with an extraordinary interest".
"Our foreign policy platform that we offer US partners is based on the principles of transparency, transparency and transparency," he said, noting that the AKP diplomacy is reality and efficiency.
Osman Korark, the son of Turkey &aposs sixth President Fahri Corridk, believes the AKP has changed the international image of Turkey.
"Today we use our political interests in the country, instead of creating a very stable foreign policy," he said, adding that "We are questioning questioning questions that Turkey has not been expected to do everything on its role in the region."
"For example, many West think that Turkey is not expected to be a leader of the social moves in the Middle East today, while the AKP is trying to take the votes in the country, citing the opportunity," he said.
"In particular, the most vulnerable of the Western Balkans' concerns about Turkey 'relations with the West." The country is thought to think that the country is democratic. "
"We are the option of all these are the opposition," said AKP deputy leader Salih Kapusz, who advocates his party 'policies.' Our own nature and this is accepted as an official opinion of Turkey by the entire world.
We are not here from our people or international partners. "In Washington, we say that in Eastern Europe, we are always confirmed in Turkey," he said.
"Our countries have a partnership between our countries, but this does not mean Washington has to support the writers," he said.
Jusuf Tunin, a political scientist at the Ankara Institute for Strategic Co-operation, says all parties are focusing on foreign policy, such as every election campaign, but that people in the Middle East -- have shown interest in Eastern policies, due to the unrest in the Middle East.
"The AKP is good for this, and it is not trying to get the support of the West."
"However, the situation is different for the CHP," he said, noting that the main opposition party is based on the secular policy basis and that is why the West has been supported.
"The Turkish people are becoming an international official and recognised that the country is becoming an important role in international relations.
The outcome of AKP policies will be seen in the June 12th elections. "
Still, the elections are expected to be finished with the AKP, and protect the CHP as the main opposition party.

The Serbian national team took the first World Cup match with Gana on Sunday (June 13th) at the D Group on Sunday (June 13th) and forced the tournament to take the second round.

Technical actor Radomir Antic was tolerated to Gana, where he was able to track the players and define the fast traces, but Prehiia faced a number of different reality.
Serbian medium-installed players have achieved long-standing passports to forums, while Gana tratures attacked Serbs.
Canat actor players Milos Krasic and Nenad Milijas have been working to check the greatest opportunity in the first 20 minutes of the match, but they did not have a single important opportunity in the first 20 minutes.
For the first time, Serbian forums Nikola Zigic and Marko Pantelic did not leave the house.
Zigic, 202cm, was almost detailed, while Pantelic, who played in the same position, finished only a few times.
The Serbian office finished the rhetoric after anbak Zigic leaved his place in the 69th minute, forfortress Danko Lazovic.
Meanwhile, the Serbian channel has made the effect of Gana ’ s chances.
The paper entered almost stalemate, while unaware and finished.

A person also increased the Serbian team.
However, Zravko Kuzovic was in the 83th minute, where Gana was insufficient in a Serbian prison coup.
This was begun to Gana, and the Aamobar Ghdad sent to the mountains and send up to 1-0 to Gana.
The discovered Kuzovic was free to the public because he was a mistake.
Serbia now awaits a battle against beautiful minimum in the ICJ. Takim played with Germany on Friday, citing Australia 4-0, defeating Australia.
Antic tried to create a positive weather, saying the Gana match was "stood and that the team is prepared to face Germany".
Technical beat "showed themselves a different stance, because they have to get a score of the remaining matches", he said.

Papadopoulos is playing in Panaikos Piraeus, a close rival opponent against Panaikos.

"I do not want to speak at the moment," Karagakis said, noting that there is many things that the tournament will say after the tournament.

However, all those who are completely different cultural and diagnosed, will be an impossible story.
How is only a happy optimistic?

However, I have a little mixed number of the tasks of the tasks, and I am afraid that you can do almost everything.
A military jury flights from the stadium in Johanburg, where the architecture began to report the opening of the church, and then it has a more efficient Freedom.
The World African culture was the opportunity to feel.
The surprise was not close to the stadium.
One of the reasons is traffic.
Following the swimming ceremony, South Africa and Meksika began to take the match.
They were a retail.
The Games' bottom, but the rivers were discovered.
The South African people are not happy, but also as well.
Earlier this few hours, Africa was the first time in the world.
Of course, the poor entities have found here.
During the South Africa match, you think that one will come to the Internet connections.
The deaths were bought, but they were only "volunteers".
Most of the internet providers did not want to stay our problems.
There is a lot of contemporary disciplinary sympathy (many crowds).
I am beautiful, but I would like to say that I would be a traditional cheaper with young people and flags.
Journalists and a number of widespread smuggling officials have increased problems in the Serbian main camp.
Apart from the press meeting, they would allow us to speak with the players.
The press meeting was released by the national broadcaster RTS.
We have not come to participate in a city that everyone can see from Belgrade, and we have so many money for that.

It was impossible.
Everybody arrived in the Lbers Stadyseni of sports.
The photographs were spottered, and the flags were sparked, while the committee was thought.
The paper was a full disaster for Serbs.
Any idea is a barrier in the players.
Therefore, they were unearthed.
A swimming is a game.
The majority of the standards were satisfied with the winner of Gana 1-0.
As a result, the entity African team has been located.
If there is no chance, it is a job.
Therefore, the vessels have begun to take reality.
And this is the internet.

IMF dropped global growth forecast
The Turkish economy has increased by 6.6% this year, while the Greek economy will be reduced by 5%, according to a new World Economic Government report.
(IMF, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, AP, AFP, BBC, Dnevnik.bg - 20 / 09 / 11)
The IMF dropped the global growth rate for 2011 and 2012 on Tuesday (September 20th). [Reuters]
The IMF said the economic recovery has become more uncertain than expected earlier this year, noting on Tuesday (September 20th) that global growth estimates on 2011 and 2012.
"The global economy has entered a new phase of danger," the latest World Economic Force (WEO) report said. "Government weaknesses have been weakened and more regular, confidence has been declined in the past period, and the risk of negative risks."
In June, the Fund said the world economy expects to increase by 4.3% in 2011 and 4.5% in 2012.
On Tuesday, the agency revised the estimates from 5% in 2010 to 4% for both years.
The global economy is under the effect of two negative developments this year, and uncertainty in the developed economies is more slow, and in particular in the past months.
The two negative elements, the IMF said in a new report, have made it more poor to the internal affairs.
"We need strong policies to improve and reduce the risks," IMF Vice Economist Olivier Blanchard said on Tuesday. "However, the governments can be able to make a more powerful and more powerful decision on the monetary policy, financing and external memorandum."
Fon stressed, however, that Western leaders are a real risk to return to the crisis if they do not move forward.
[IMF]
The new report sets growth estimates for the Eurozone in June to 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively, respectively and 1.7% in June for 2012.
The two countries in the monetary area -- Greece and Portugal -- will have negative growth.
The Greek economy is expected to drop by 5% this year, while Portugal is expected to decrease by 2% next year, 2.2% in 2011 and 1.8% in 2012.
Voicing concern about the ongoing debt crisis in the Eurozone, the IMF urged the 17 member states to take the necessary steps.
The leaders "ratified their commitments during the July summit, while the European Central Bank should intervene strong intervention in order to ensure regular conditions in the country debt markets," the IMF report said. "The leaders should do everything to protect national policies and security."
Greek debt problems "can be very managing", the interior IMF economist Jorg Kalressin said on Tuesday.
While criticising speculation over the possibility of the Balkan countries' Eurozone speculation, he rejected any promise that the region could be distributed. "
According to Fon experts, the Turkish economy will grow by 6.6% this year, with the highest growth of 14 Central and Eastern European economies, but this figure will be lower than next year, when it is expected to increase 2.2% of GDP.
Croatia is the country that is expected to rise at least in this group this year, with an increase of 0.8%.
However, the IMF cautioned that the new estimates are based on a number of assets. "European policy analysts can block the crisis in the Eurozone to the environmental countries, but US policymakers can cover a medium-term balance between supporting the economy, and not more falling business markets in the global financial markets."
The global growth "will be very low," he warned.

The players, who met with five female fans at the Greek-Military Airport, were later created by a couple bus.
"We were doing our production to Russia at the Bronian medal, but we said we had no need for a gold medal when we prepared today," said Technical actor Marin Dokuzovski.
The Macedonian team, which has become one of the best four teams in Europe, has become an international phenomenographic, speaking to the New York Times, as all of them speak to the Croatian Strport.
The six winners, such as Croatia, Greece and Lithuania, have chosen the most popular players, including Macedonians, Russia and Spain.
Macedonian basketball legend Blagoja Dacski speaks to SETimes about the team and sports.
SETimes: What are Macedonian team expectations in Lithuania?
Blagoja Dacski: No one did not believe our skills and the first results were not a special thing.
With the championship progress, however, the team has become more difficult and more determined to defend the long-term player in this field.
First Croatia, Slovenia, Greece and Lithuania have already begun a victory in a victory. The team began to gain free confidence.
The love of players and the players' logical unity and active basketball principles is to advance and better defence.
I have not won a medal, but we won the gold medal if the team will see the success.
SETimes: How do you announce this outcome?
Srski: Such a number of other cities should be safe, and there is no good advocation, the quality of votes and good advocation.
Therefore, there are many reasons, but all of the most important players are based on the basis of the quality and the voting of all products.
Lester "Bo", "Bo", "My Calebb, who revealed that Italy has come from the Monteki team.
"I would like to see the aggressive votes and beautiful players, all of them 'stamp in our team.
All the players have entered the most female in the tournament at the end of the tournament, the most female player and three per cent.
Each European and world experts in Lithuania have been interpreted with our player, especially in the number of team defence.
Koumumn Marin Dokuzovski has a rich experience and revealed the entire capacity of these players.
The votes have a strong authority among them, and it was the success.
SETimes: What is important to create a strong team?
Dimitroski: Two years ago, he joined the EuroPress in Poland.
At the time, it was insufficient to provide a potential signal that must work on ninth and work on the ninth, but it seems to be done on the formation of the vote and advocation.
We can wait for a medal in the future if this success is more investment.
SETimes: Do you think this success is the opportunity to play in the players and prominent European clubs?
Srski: All the players in Lithuania have increased, and many of them have become the target.
In Lithuania, the team was the most speaker.
I talk about Antic, Stojanovski brothers and husband Martin Dokuzovski.
This is very important for the future, because the national team is a different one of the players who played in competitiveness Europe.
We will contribute to more powerful and more quality players.
SETimes: Do you have an increase in basketball in Macedonia?
Dacski: This is the fact that the Yugoslav team was the world championship in 1970s.
A single mafia that has not played a basketball player has no school or destroyed.
People are only basketball.
Currently, Macedonia has opened the door to European and world basketball.
He opened the door to all children.
I am convinced that this success will attract many people.
Macedonia also opened its doors to the world.
We have become a potential candidate for the Olympics in London and we will participate in the next European Championship in Ljubljana in 2013.
SETimes: What can you meet the basketball in the former Yugoslavia with the basketball?
Dacski: The Yugoslav basketball plays in the world.
We always won a medal.
The number of individual players have more expensive.
The basketball basketball is currently at the level, but today the number of votes is a precondition.
Spain plays five NBA star star in the team.
Macedonia, however, has not been a player, but the first half of the food was prevented.
We can agree on the outcome of the European basketball team.

In Turkey, both the EU and the United States have begun to increase.
However, a expert at the Marshall Fund, says this trend could be removed if the right steps are taken.

According to a recent survey by the US-based public policy agency Marshall Fund (GMF), Turkish people have started a serious crowd against the United States and Europe, and an increasingly increasingly optimistic of foreigners to the West.
In a study by Tranlvtic Travel 2007, the Turkish Cypriots continue to reduce support for EU membership and increasing criticism against both the United States and the EU in the global leadership.
The shield to the United States has dropped from 20 degrees in 2006 to 11 degrees in "a 100-point" monopoly ".
Over 18-24, young Turks and the United States (15) are both the United States and the EU (28) are slightly worse than the average of the country.
"In the past two years, major problems in foreign policy, instability in neighbouring Iraq, PKK attacks and suspension of EU membership talks," said Ian Lesser, a senior Turkish experts from the Fund. "I believe that this is still a restructuring process.
This is possible for the steps that Washington and Brussels will be taken. "
Lesser pointed out the importance of the EU perspective, noting that one of the most important steps to take the country as a serious perspective.
"The Turkish people are very important to the concerns of imprisonment by Americans and Europe.
Washington and Brussels have stressed the importance of Turkey as an international player, "he said.
Although 40% of the surveyed participants are still positive to EU membership, it is continued.
The rise was 14% and 33% compared to 2004.
Meanwhile, Turkey has been delayed by disputes and other issues on Cyprus, and some of the bloc -- particularly French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- said it is clear that Turkey has made its membership.
According to the GMF survey, support for Turkey continued to decrease.
Only 35% of the surveys said NATO is essential for its security, while 44% were 53% in 2004.
Analysts say that this is part of the main trend between NATO member states and reflects the disaster and unknown discontent over the new role of the alliance, which has been seen as new security threats.
The problems with the United States, which Turkey operates outside Iraq, have been involved in relations with PKK militants.
The majority of Turks believe there is no interest in concerns.
Many also accused European countries of supporting the PKK.
The survey found that the Western political players in the region have increased in negative positions for Western political players.
Relations against neighbouring Iran have dropped from 43 to 30 degrees last year.
Turkish participants feel "crowd" against Russia (21) and China (28) on 100 points.

The Serbian government has shown widespread reaction to a new report, claiming the private needs of children and pieces have seen poor treatment in social climate institutions, while Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica described the allegations as "poor".
"The charges against children are being used for torture and are particularly poor, in particular, that they are not the social climate institutions," he said.
Kostunica added that a special commission will be formed to prepare a report on the real conditions of the people who have special needs to be made within the institutions.
The International Organisation for Human Rights (MDRI), a US-based NGO, published a four-year study report on November 14th.
The study revealed the poor conditions in six institutions in Serbia and documents with restaurants.
The MDRI suggested that children are linked to their homes, as they are unsufficient medical climate, they have to do their books and learn out of the beautiful.
"The circumstances are threatened to live in Serbian institutions, medical care and insufficient science, and insufficient experience," the report said. "MDRI inspectors are not allowed to see their children and clothes in some years, and they are not allowed to leave their roads."
Although the government does not accept the problem, it said, resources are blocking efforts to reform the system of weaknesses and lack of social support and the lack of laws.
"These are the most vulnerable citizens of Serbia.
Thousands of people, humanitarian and extraordinary treatment and abuse are closed to the institutions.
"Children and papers have been linked to the lives of their life and are a dangerous and efficient treatment, and the European Conference on Human Rights is a clear violation," he said.
"We are urging the Serbian government to stop this poor treatment and urge all obstacles to respect human rights," Rosenthal said.
Kostunica, however, charged the MDRI for entering a car campaign that has been given the same date for the Kosovo status talks.
"The Serbian government will focus on the current democratic and legal ways," he added.
Serbian Labour and Social Security Minister Rasim Ljajic, meanwhile, said the report has been a political image, but criticised.
However, Ljajic said that the MDRI has suggested the improvement of the conditions under the obstacles' obstacles, that Serbia would propose a precondition for the future of EU membership talks.
"It is not clear that this report will be made before the international media is submitted to us, and it is not clear to a press conference before the official submitted to state institutions," he said.
Health Minister Tomica Milosavljevic is a report "political abuse".
"A person or organisation came to the public prior to the public, but it is not seen as a surprise movement, but not more political abuse," Milosavljevic said.
Nevertheless, government representatives promised to improve the situation of institutions that serve as private needs.
An action plan to prepare a labour strategy has been accepted and is also prepared for a bill on the protection of the rights of the people who are in accordance with active experience.
The government has invested 12m euros to renew the hospital hospitals and plans to build new institutions.

"The legitimacy of this investigation could be guaranteed by the creation of an effective witness protection programmes," Serbian President Boris Tadic said.
Serbian Minister for Kosovo and Metohija Goran Bogdanovic said the report would need to protect witnesses in Kosovo for an investigation into the allegations of the Council of Europe, because Marty said the monuments were based on the testimony.
Milos Alidic, a member of the Strasbourg parliamentary delegation, said PACE 'support for Marty' report, gives the victims "a number of forests" to their families.
"Now, Serbia must do everything in order to investigate a investigation and to ensure that the perpetrators are punished by Marty," Alidic said.
The two other decisions adopted on Wednesday were interested in a compromise and dialogue between the former Yugoslav countries and to co-operate in the prosecution of war crimes.
The PACE suggested that the countries should make the losses and refugee issues a priority for the reconciliation process.
They also urged BiH to "take emergency steps to fulfil their commitments as a member of the Council of Europe" and launch comprehensive reforms, including constitutional reforms ".
"The fight against immunity should be committed and co-operation between all states is essential," the decision on co-operation in prosecuting war crimes.

EU lawmakers say the biggest obstacle to Croatia could be to reduce the benefits of membership.

Croatia could complete its EU accession talks within a few months, according to the European Parliament &aposs decision on Wednesday (January 26th). [European Commission]
The European Parliament (EP) Foreign Affairs Committee adopted a draft resolution Wednesday (January 27th) that Croatia could complete its EU accession talks by the end of June, but voiced concern about the country &aposs anti-EU airport.
The document, drafted by the Croatian rapporteur for Croatia, was adopted by Austrian MEP Hannes Swoboda, was adopted by three pupils and 62 votes.
The document praised Croatia for its "clear" progress in reform, while amendments to the constitution and judicial system are being seen as an example.
At the same time, however, Zagreb has also noted progress in co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), stressing that the country has not yet made some key military documents wanted by The Hague tribunal.
"The negotiations with Croatia could be completed in the first half of 2011 if the necessary reforms continue," the MEP said.
They ranked among the areas that the fight against public administration reform and the fight against corruption, the country must do more in the next five months to complete negotiations with Brussels.
"Corruption is widely widespread in Croatia and continues to be a serious general problem," the AP said in a draft resolution.
The document is considered a former prime minister, other high-level government officials and public utilities, prosecuting the authorities' efforts to tackle the issue.
Several corruption cases, however, have been tried to court, and most of them remain at the investigation stage.
Stressing the need for transparency and fair judiciary, the MEP also urged Croatian authorities to ensure that corruption investigations will remain from political intervention.
They also called for more progress in the field of refugee returns in the coming months.
While the public decreased to decrease Serbs, Croatia must speed up efforts to help the return to permanent session, solve housing problems and ensure more resources with the society.
MEP also urged Zagreb to show full co-operation with the ICTY as a key priority for Balkan countries that want to join the EU.
If Croatia wants to complete the negotiating chapter on competitiveness, it also stressed that the country must restructuring and accelerate the privatisation process.
According to the MEP, however, the biggest obstacle between Croatia and the 28th member of the EU is doing to convince its benefits for membership.
The latest survey conducted by Eurobarometer believes that only 25% of Croatian people will be "good" for the country, while nearly a third of the participants see it as "bad", 38% of them "nor bad".
The MEP officials and civil society have called on authorities and the public to "see the European project as a" own project ", as Croatia &aposs accession should be done before the EU.
The same Eurobarometer survey said participants would vote against EU membership, while 38% said they would support it.

Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has continued diplomatic withdrawal on the Kosovo plan, while the preparation is relatively relatively worse on the basis of the document.
Both in Kosovo and other countries are focused on the preliminary part of the proposal 'recommendation in Kosovo, a national margineering, and more important for international agreements and becoming a member of international organisations.
The plan, which will ensure that Ahtisaari has been proposed, will provide the implementation of the plan, is not much of the tasks that are really important.
There is no clear idea in Pristina, nor in the street of North Mitrovica that the citizens in the street will be "the history of independence".
Ahtisaari aims to make Kosovo a multiethnic society before everything, and is also recognised by key rights to Albanian non-Albanian communities under the plan.
In Kosovo, where more than 90 per cent of the population is created by Albanians, Serbian, Roman, Azerbi, GDP, Egyptian, Turkish and Bosniak communities have a very serious signal in every area.
In his plan, he envisions an asymmetric state.
It is clear that the minority parties in Kosovo will play a critical role in the establishment of both the government and government policies.
In addition, Ahtisaari must not reveal any of the proposals for the communist rights.
These proposals were expressed by the Kosovo Albanian entity during direct talks in Vienna.
As the first step, Kosovo has to accept a constitution that will include many elements in the Ahtisaari plan.
A total of 21 members of the Serbian community must be formed, including three other minorities.
The constitution should be held within nine months after the current parliament in Kosovo was adopted by the current parliament.

The new electoral system is largely based on the former system, but some important changes are also on the basis.
Parliament still has 120 seats based on the island clean.
The main amendment is that the party lists will be open -- the lists have been closed so far, and most citizens are not satisfied with this practice.
Ten Serbian communities were selected for non-Albanian communities, including ten other communities.
These are the necessary minimum conditions for the first two elections.
Each seats won in the elections are additional to seats.
The new parliamentary rules include various rules related to the quality majority votes.
Some amendments, both the parliament and the majority of votes representing smaller minorities in parliament, need to be taken.
Earlier, everyone must take the approval of any specific change.
The new cabinet will be a Serbian minister and another small minority representation.
The same foundation also applies for the deputy prime minister.
As the number of members are more than 12, the cabinet will be a minister of small minorities and a deputy prime minister.
For any change in the future constitution, both three of the assembly and two of the deputies representing small minorities must be approved.
The same constitution is also implemented for the justice system.
At least 15 per cent of the judges at the Kosovo Constitutional Court have to be small minority communities.
Among the areas, national level institutions were given broad officials at the local level.
In any formal language of Kosovo (Albanians) and Serbs), the right to education and national symbols and national symbols have been guaranteed for liberalisation.
The mayor of the Municipal Assembly, which has more than 10 per cent of the population, will be conducted by a representative of small minorities.
As the Ohrid Framework Agreement envisions, the multiethnic ethnic structure of the Kosovo community will reflect every level of public service.
However, the local government is the most important.
The issue is the biggest obstacle for the Albanian majority, because the Ahtisaari plan envisions a series of new municipalities to create a simple state structure, and to meet the demands of Serbs.
In North Mitrovica, for instance, high school and health issues are leaving the local government.
The same situation is applied for other municipalities where Serbs are majority.
Serbian education schools will be able to reinforce the books that are developed by ministries in Serbia.
While there is no intention to be planned, the international community in Kosovo envisions a serious presence.
As in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the plan is also given several comprehensive officials from the International Civilian Observation (UST), which also serves as the EU special representative.
Its authority is clear: itself will be an extraordinary centre in implementing the Ahtisaari plan.
This is the UST, which has created a difference between independence and control independence.

The Ahtisaari plan is more than an independent Kosovo.
Ahtisaari offers a framework for the new chapter in Kosovo &aposs house process.
Plan predicts that stalemate, when it comes to independence, the circumstances in the region have made it clear for such a solution would be a bigger period.
Now, the task of the communities in Kosovo is to prove that they can protect multiethnic structures under this balance, which will be the most popular and potential.
The Albanian majority has dropped in the demonstration of the political will and request for the implementation of Ahtisaari &aposs visas.
At the same time, however, Albanian non-Albanian communities must use themselves in the most effective effect.
If these communities do not manage to use the Ahtisaari plan and the use of powers, the criminal Albanian community should not be wanted in the Albanian community.
The response to the plan is reached, which both sides need to show more attention to the details of the plan, because it is detailed about what it is said to be in the exchange.
Now the Kosovo media has now been focused on the outcome of a completely vote and on the diplomatic force with Serbia and Russia.
At the end, many things are said to be moved.
Meanwhile, the Serb community in Kosovo has an opportunity to think that Ahtisaari could use his proposal in accordance with its own benefits.
They think that Kosovo will not be able to leave a new Albanian state established in the Balkans, but the plan will not be able to see it.
In addition to a campaign that will be organised by Albanian officials in Kosovo, the public could be able to understand how it is expected to implement.
The Albanian majority has entered a series of comprehensive obligations that will not be satisfied with the plan and dissatisfied with all.
Following this point, a society of information about the political will and process is essential for Kosovo to make progress.

In an effort to assume, 3.8% of the Bosnia and Herzegovina GDP, Croatia is providing education to 5%.
However, there is no good news.
The Academy is improving the world and working conditions.
As part of an agreement signed last month between the ministry of Education and Telekom Srbija, all schools in the country will have internet access until mid-2009.

Bulgarian president urges efforts to strengthen crime and corruption
Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov urged Bulgarian government and politicians on Sunday to fight organised crime and corruption, because his country could join the EU in January 2007, as planned.

"Our steps that we are here seems to be repeatedly repeatedly from Romania," Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov said in Bucharest, calling for prosecutions against more than a dozen high-level political alcohol. [Getty Images]
President Georgi Parvanov said on Sunday that Bulgaria must take urgent steps in the fight against crime and corruption, stressing the need for stronger action in the fight against crime and corruption.
Parvanov told reporters in the Black Sea coastal coast that the European Commission published on 16 May shows that Bulgaria is still not ready for EU membership.
The EC has four more times to address the problems that are waiting for a solution, before the country is ready to join the Union on 1 January 2007, as planned, its next important assessment on whether the country is ready to join the Union.
The report released last week ranked six places that Bulgaria must find a solution as emergency, and have made serious concern.
In the next four months, Sofia must "show more clear evidence in investigating organised crime networks and prosecution", ensuring that laws on the fight against fraud and more efficient and efficient implementation of the laws on corruption "and implement better practices on money laundering".
Bulgaria also needs to strengthen financial control on the future use of structural and competencies and boost agricultural administration.
If the country fails to deal with these problems, EU membership could be postponed to January 2008.
Although these are only 145 of the EU '145 areas, Parvanov said, the results in any areas of "discrimination" can block Bulgaria' membership in the time.
Bulgaria can still fulfil its tasks in the fight against money laundering, the president said, calling for the two bill submitted to parliament -- anti-money laundering measures and the new Criminal Tribunal.
In combating corruption, Parvanov reiterated that former methods do not give the consequences, stressing that it is not the establishment of an independent service in fighting corruption.
The proposed body should be given a safety of independence from institutions under control, the president said.
Bulgaria must show that none of the rule of law in the next four months should demonstrate that the judiciary or executive force, he said, urging political parties to organise the activities of political parties.
Citing politicians and government officials to reveal their assets, Parvanov said on Monday that he and his family would buy the assets of him and his family.

EU foreign ministers will meet on Friday (December 17th) for the summit, expected to begin accession talks with Turkey.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who arrived in Brussels on Wednesday, appeared confident with the new European Parliament (EP) report, which proposed the start of talks.
Welcoming the EP recommendation as "very autonomous", Erdogan told reporters that "we are happy," he told reporters.
While noting that Turkey has made progress in meeting the necessary political criteria for membership, minority rights, freedom of expression, the role of the military, the Cyprus issue and bilateral relations with Armenia, the report noted.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told France-2 television on Wednesday that Turkey has made great efforts on its path to membership and that accession of the Union would be "very positive for Europe".
"I believe the situation is going," Barroso said.
The Turkish Parliament, which aims to boost human rights standards, adopted a new Criminal Tribunal for Pension (CEC) last week.
Turkey, which has been trying to bring its laws with the EU, has passed new laws in many areas in the past years, in which minority broadcasters have been sentenced to death sentences.
The CMUK, which is considered an important part of Turkish efforts to meet with the EU, aims to end workers and poor treatment cases.
Following ten years, police forces with broad powers will have to comply with a series of aspects, including borders that have brought the detention of the arrests.
The new law has also made clear that the "state ranking", which is abuse of tightening, would not be able to use information on crimes as an obstacle to the courts.
However, information that the country could have serious effects on the constitution, constitutional door, external relations and security may still be classified.
The law also allows the witnesses to call for the court through telephone, e-poster or faculty, and the removal of witnesses involved in organised crime cases is possible.
Under the new CCUK, prosecutors and judges can ask for the DNA and vice example of suspects, but this will be essential for doctors.
The suspects and provisions will be disclosed by women 'doctors.
The government submitted the new law as a new step on the path to harmonisation with the EU, but some of the parties in Turkey seemed a hidden rest.
According to critics, the CMUK envisions the establishment of new penalties at the State Security Court, which is now removed.

These figures were two of the figures last year.
According to Albanian officials, the Free Trade Agreement signed between the two countries in late 2003 is one of the main factors.

The business circumstances in Albania and Serbia-Montenegro are widely considered crucial for the reconstruction of relations between the two countries that reinvited diplomatic relations in March 2001.
Since then, government officials have made a series of mutual visits to discuss bilateral co-operation.
A historic visit to Belgrade in 2002, former Prime Minister Ilir Meta was the first visit to the country since 1946.
Political relations between Tirana and Belgrade have shown improvement in the past five years, but the main optimism of co-operation has come from trade.
Furthermore, the Albanian presence on the Serbia-Montenegro market was limited with biometric and mobile.
The list of exports to Albania was on the beginning of the list of wine, beaches, today, food and foundation.

The details and international observers require the tension of the Bosniak community in the Sandzak region in western Serbia.

The Bosniak National Council, led by the census Muammar Zukorlic, asked the EU to send international observers to Sandzak, as he allegedly violated "religious and ethnic rights".
This call on Monday (September 6th) was the last point in the political climate in Sandzak, the Bosniak community in Sandzak.
In the region, politics are traditional: Rasim Ljajic, the Democratic Party of Sandzak (SDP) and Sulejman Ugljanin &aposs Democratic Action Party (SDA).
Although Both Ljajic and the Ugljanin cabinet are prime minister, the parties are very sceptical and even always turned into a disputed dispute.
Following the election of the Bosniak National Council, a political institution, a third of the Bosniak National Council was revealed.
Zukorlic, head of the Islamic Community, said he would support the establishment of a new party that will work to protect Bosniak rights.
Zukorlic, Ljajic and Ugljanin have accused the ministry of repeating the interests of the public.
The two officials in the finance of the criticism say it would not harm Bosniaks' interests of Bosniaks, and that Sandzak will not be any other job without economic and political discrimination.
On September 4th, when the Islamic Community claimed it is being built by themselves, the incidents took place in Novi Luka on 4 September.
The city administration, including Bosniaks, says the resort is the municipality.
Three police officers were discovered in the unrest.
The Islamic Community asked Sandzak to speed up the process of autonomy after the incidents, and called for "the regime and the pro-regime parties" to have civilian unity ".
Mufti Zukorlic also invited Belgrade officials to launch dialogue to protect peace and stability.
Ljajic 'party officials, Meho Omerovic, rejected Sandzak to propose a proposal for foreign observers.
"The international observers that will go to the polling will not be a true problem or a discrimination against Muslims here, what will be the ruling of the Islamic community," he told SETimes.
The Serbian government has not yet made an official opinion on monitoring, but Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that "all problems that are awaiting for a solution in Sandzak should be released through negotiations."
"The police is not to solve religious and political problems," Dacic said.
Ian Bancroft, the founder of the Transparency organisation, told SETimes that the Sandzak problem should be resolved by reconciliation within the Bosniak community.
"Sandzak is not a unique place in the Balkans, because there are no basic clashes, not among the basic ethnic groups, but in a certain ethnic group.
The initiatives of Zukorlic and politics of Zukorlic, as the Bosniak national minority have seen a concrete way in the elections, are jeopardising stability in the region, "he said.
"Zukorlic has tried to change the main reasons of a political climate in the SDA and SDP sovereign sovereignty, while religious and symbolic showed a referendum with a sovereignty and separate basis," he said.
However, Bancroft said in Sandzak that the situation could still be smaller conflict. "However, Zukorlic does not support and the approach of many Bosniaks, and the Serbian government will not implement an official policy, such as Zukorlic, as he hoped."
"At this point -- the Serbian government, civil political platforms, civil political platform, religious dialogue and economic development," Bancroft said. "

The Serbian and Montenegrin police have also agreed on a joint transference on the Montenegrin coastal coastal season, as one of the most recent example of regional police co-operation, as well as to form a fight against organised crime.
"We want to show that police co-operation between the two countries is essential to prevent crimes," said Serbian Police Director Milorad Veljovic.
Montenegrin police spokesperson Radomir Radunovic told SETimes that such a approach of the crimes that do not see free movement and borders as a permanent factor.
"This includes the share of police experiences, professional education and investigations for members of the two police," Radunovic said.
Zeljko Likovic, owner of the Podgorica tourist tour Liky Tours, is one of the numerous tourist workers who welcomed the police service.
"Our judges are very important to feel confidence in Montenegro.
I do not say that Montenegro is safe, but this move is crucial to prevention, because it is one of the people want to help, "he said.
Liky Turs reserved for more than 2,000 tourists from Serbia last year and Likovic expects the number of Serbian tourists to increase this year.
Dragan Samolov, 43, who lives in Belgrade, says his family is holding a holiday in Kotor, Montenegro, and has no problem on security so far.
"In all these years, I am convinced that the cancer, some more frequent young people and more lived people.
This is not very important, but in each other, "he said.
In the past period, some people have been hidden weapons and police are fighting this problem, Samolov said.
"Still, I did not see any way that the weapons have been involved in Montenegro for 20 years," he said.
Authorities say the agreement has improved long-standing co-operation between Serbia and Montenegro police agencies.
Radunovic added that co-operation with other police services in the region is clear.
Co-operation in police is not a new thing for the Croatian police, which has implemented the Security Tourism Sea project with Slovenia, Hungary, Hungary, Austria, the Czech Republic and Germany.
As many Hungarian tourists are regular, Hungarians are the biggest group in Croatia, as Hungarians arrive in the Croatian coast.
Last summer, 40-Hungarian police officers tried to the Croatian coast with Croatian counterpart.
Bosnia and Herzegovina border police have also been working with Croatian counterpart.
This group has already been transferred to the Sava River, which is a border between the two countries.
In addition, Kosovo police have been co-operating with Albanian police for two years, while several Kosovo Albanians are working together to ensure their road security during the summer season in Albania.
Banja Luka Security and Defence Affairs Professor Predrag Ceranic told SETimes that the joint police work is an excellent co-operation, when the criminals are complicated and reinformed in the region, as well as restoring the conditions for police.
"The aircraft co-operate with their counterparts in neighbouring countries, therefore, police are essential to co-operate in order to fight them.
This will become a trend in the region and will be more difficult to operate in these circumstances, "he said.
Veljovic suggested that police forces continue to continue this trust in the region and the area.
"We want co-operation between Serbia and Montenegro in the entire region and this is an example of Europe."
Macedonia begins dialogue with EU
The EU will launch a high-level dialogue to help Macedonia maintain the pace of institutional reforms and to ensure that Greece will remain on the path to EU membership, despite its objections.

Macedonia is due to meet with EU officials on March 15th for talks aimed at protecting the details of the accession process by Greece. [Reuters]
Macedonia and the EU will start high-ranking preliminary talks aimed at reducing the official negotiation process, which must be completed to begin accession talks.
EC President Jose Manuel Barroso and Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele acknowledged the start of talks with the Macedonian administration on 15 March in Ohrid.
The goal of dialogue is to protect Macedonia into the way of institutional reforms aimed at bringing closer to the EU, the EU delegation said in a statement.
"The reason for the beginning of a commission member, Fulle, to start dialogue with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski -- to address the challenges in the reform area," EU spokesperson Konstantin Jovanovic told SETimes.
The talks will focus on reforms, strengthening the rule of law, protection of media freedom, improving the election process and improving market economy, Jovanovic said.
"Macedonia now seems to be a high-profile treatment and it is a step forward, despite the obstacle of Greece," Gruevski said.
Macedonia has been waiting a date for the start of EU membership talks for 3 years.
Greece has blocked plans to invite Macedonia into NATO in 2008 and has taken EU membership due to a long-standing name dispute in 2009.
Greece says the name "Macedonia" has meaning a conservative claim on the region that has the same name of Macedonia.
Macedonia, which accepted the UN under the "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", says it would mean the national identity of the name. More than 100 countries recognise it as "Republic of Macedonia".
As part of the dialogue mechanism, EU and Macedonian leaders will meet in two years, but dialogue will continue for the year.
In October, a progress report will be released.
"It will encourage similar mechanisms to be created in other areas," Political Studies Centre analyst Vladimir Bozhinovski told SETimes.
According to Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Teuta Arifi, the highest level dialogue cannot retain official accession talks.
"The dialogue is a cautious opinion that the EU has responded to the activities we have made since the latest EC progress report," Arifi said.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, however, said the ICJ decision on Macedonia and the Macedonian interim agreement envisions a framework for Macedonia to continue the EU integration process.
Ivanov also reflected this stance at a meeting with top EU officials in late last month -- Richard Hewitt, Eduard Kukan, Lojania -- during a meeting last month.
"This process should continue in parallel talks with Greece to find a solution to the name dispute," Ivanov Foreign Affairs Adviser Darko Kosinovki told SETimes.
Some analysts say the dialogue mechanisms will overcome the current regional bilateral disagreements and facilitate the candidates' EU membership.
"In 1981, the European Parliament decided on Greece 'EU membership, but the country was adopted because of political pressure," he said.
Other countries in the region that aims to join the EU have not been announced, but analysts say bilateral disagreements will be a problem in the process.
Belgrade and Pristina reached an agreement last month on regional representation of Kosovo, but Brussels responded to a very positive response, giving Serbia a candidate for EU membership.
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) will apply for EU membership in July.
The problems BiH faced are reforms and the relations with Serbia and Croatia on the position of Croats in Republika Srpska and BiH.
China seems to Greek vehicles
The China will cover Greek wrestlers, due to a 10-year trade agreement signed earlier this year.
By Maria Paravantes for Southeast European Times in Athens -- 12 / 03 / 12
As part of the agreement, more than 3.5 million Greek cars will be exported to China. [Reuters]
VAENI-Nai, a wine producer of 220 local wine producers, signed the biggest wine export agreement with one of Chinese leading companies.
The VAENI is pushing the way for efforts, after the China market won the Chinese market, including a "test" initiative last year, which began to send its number of 250,000.
"The key funding is to find and compete.
Now, it must be in the right way, "he said.
Macedonia is among the major wine products in the country, with Greece "xino euro" in Naxta, Greece.
VAENI has a total of 50% of the total wine production of Nax, with the exports of three million euros annually and exports to 27 countries.
"The Children are beautiful.
"There is no chance of Xinomomomomoma and this is a great potential," Fountoulis said, adding that Greek writer producers should be returned to other markets.
He said the company is in the market with the Hint market.
A writer VAENI car plans to export other Greek products, including the sold between 2 and 14 euros in China.
Since the 2004 Olympic Games, China has shown great interest in traditional Greek products.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao approved Greek waste during a recent official visit to Greece.
Wen Domaine Tselepos opened the door of Greek exports.
Several months later, donor Yiannis Tseles, the owner of Domaine Tselepos, signed a 840m-euro agreement and sent 45,000 euros to Asia in 2011.
Meanwhile, a Greek wine producer, Mihalis Boutaris, has begun to China, and local producer Mogao has established Valley Winery for co-operation with China, in west of China.
At the same time, it is extremely important to overcome Greek borders.
"Each partner trade operations or investments are supporting a more returning Greek trend, especially for China," Alexandley Boutaris told SETimes.
"Our visa-free Greek production is to ensure that we meet the expectations of Greek production, open the way for other Greek products and enable Chinese consumers to get Greek consumers," Boutaris added.
With a new justice system established in early 1980s, the EU has sparked higher standards, increasing the quality of Greek vehicles and the transfer of wine producers to international markets.
According to a 2011 report by the Greek Economic and Commercial Affairs Bureau for Economic and Commerce, Dimitris Thomopoulos, the China has become the lowest in the past three years, due to the sale of wine market, and a sold status symbolic of a number of car status.
Serbian dynamic continues to work
The Serbian national currency has lost constantly over the beginning of the year and other foreign currency units.

Serbian dynamic continues to drop in the euro. [Nada Bozic / SETimes]
The Serbian dynamic (RSD) has reached a historic level in the euro.
In 2002, the German brand was 60 euros. The foreign currency board was 110.63 RSD.
He has been repeatedly weakened over the past 10 years, but the value has increased in recent years.
The RSD continued to weaken over the past two months, despite numerous interventions by the Serbian National Bank (NBS) foreign currency disciplines.
This year, the bank said, has caused an unexpected increase in energy imports.
The amendments to the value of Dinarin has caused more effects on the domestic economy, which is based on companies for exports or imports.
While the euro has been strengthening exports companies, imports are damaging.
Mile Dragic, director of a company producing soldiers and police equipment from more than 30 countries, including the United States, said that producers based on most import products based on the weaknesses, are at risk.
"Public enterprises are negotiating only through the dynamic, without any possibility of any kind of type.
Our example is that we have been damaged by a full inflation amount of inflation in the level of inflation, so we cannot meet even a simple restructuring, "he said.
Dragic, who worked more than 350 workers, is also worried about the effect of employees on the weaknesses of foreign currency.
Slobodan Aleksic, 56, who worked at a crowd factory in Vranje, is a good example.
"It is difficult to solve the soldiers, because I am the only one that is a solid job in the family.
The initiative lost his job as the factory has been closed, and you are working in a small private company without stable.
We also received a loan from the euro and a car.
However, I don '' '' '' '' I don '' '' '' ''.
In order to avoid serious consequences of the scandal, the NBS is trying to support the use of the dynamic, reduce the use of other currency units.
Dejan Jovovic, an adviser to the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, said the measures that could be taken to reduce the value of the local currency is to increase the NBS interest rate.
"With the rise of interest rates, the loans are expensive, money supplies, the loss of money is decreased, which caused to strengthen the car," Jovovic told SETimes.

The foreign ministers of the Islamic Conference (OIC) supported an independent Kosovo at the 36th Ministerial Summit, Syria, on Monday (May 25th).
They agreed at the summit, praised "progress in strengthening democracy".
The document was drafted by the Albanian Foreign Ministry, and Saudi Arabia.
Albanian Foreign Minister Lulzim Basha described the OIC 'decision as a major success for Kosovo and Albanian democracy.
According to Basha, the decision was adopted by all 57 members.
"This is a very important decision for Kosovo and I am convinced that Kosovo will soon be recognised by many IOC member states," he said.
Since the unilateral declaration of independence in February 2008, the country has made progress in modernisation of the constitution and contributing to regional stability, the decision said.
The document calls for OIC members and international community to support the former Serb province and the economy.
The decision does not recognise Kosovo 'independence, but it is clear that the option is open to members.
The decision also points to the acceleration of UNMIK, accelerating the completion of Kosovo -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 'requests -- and the institutional framework of Kosovo.
According to the decision, Ban will submit a report at the next IOC summit.
If Serbia is working against the decision, it did not work.
However, Syria, Egypt and other countries under the effect of Russia, the IOC has repeatedly rejected the independence of Kosovo.
Kosovo Foreign Minister Smilder Hyseni welcomed the decision by a stable deadline.
On Tuesday, President Fatmir Sejdiu described the decision as a step forward in the right direction.
"We expect the new countries to recognise us and we are ready to co-operate with these countries," Sejdiu said.

Turkish writer Nedim Gurci, who was indicted in the latest route of rural and religious incidents, rejected charges against the court in Istanbul on Tuesday (May 26th).
The book "God", on the eastern of Islam in the 6th century, was published last year in Turkey.
Intelligence engineer Ali Emre Bukagal has invited the writer, saying that Georgian 'Hyz Muhamed, his wife and the Intelligence of Muslims.
"This is not possible to be criminal," Gurr, who fled Turkey during a military coup about 30 years ago, said in a court on Tuesday. "I refuse to convict that he was convicted," he said. "I am convinced with Dinalay."
Despite the decrease of accusations, the six-hour six-hour hearing was delayed on June 26th.
If he was convicted, Georgian could be sentenced to at least six months.
Prosecutors say the Bukagis is not a valuable reason to promote a evidence and writers' claim.
The court, however, rejected the decision, based on separate complaints over the first and second pressure.
Two separate cases were united on Tuesday.
He emphasised that "God" is a foundation that is the goal of convincing anyone ", which revealed questions about intellectual and violence in Islam, stressing that all of them respect.
"This book was a year of book," he told Reuters in a telephone interview. "How do you think the book reached 30,000 people?
"What is you?"
Still, the writer hoped to be acquitted, Turkey has been reminded by its decision to intervene with a report on the book of District Affairs.
It is "worried" that the mosques' mandate to control the functioning of the mosques and encourage itself, he said.
Furthermore, he noted, criticism of religious institutions, not religious institutions.
"A author can be tried to be tried by such a person," he said in a statement by the Turkish BIA news agency.
Turkey has been removing some restrictions for freedom of expression in recent years, but Georgia has only the latest Turkish writer and intellectuals to the tribunal in the past period.
For example, Orhan Pamuk, the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Nobel Prize, has been charged with charges of "insulting Turkishness" because his country is responsible for the murder of 30,000 Kurdish and 1 million Armenians.
"I think that these period has ended," Georgian DPA quoted him as saying in Turkey.

Social Democratic Party (PSD) vice-president Liviu Dragnea was nominated as the new interior minister of Romania.
PSD executive committee Dragnea approved the nomination of Dragnea on Monday (January 19th).
Dragnea was a surprise to many people.
In addition, the deputy prime minister and interim interior minister Dan Nica were estimated that Dan Nica will take office.
Furthermore, Dragnea was thought by Basescu, after President Traian Basescu took part in the Democratic Liberal Party and joined the PSD.
The final approval on any name must be the head of the state.
In an incident that now is unfortunately, the president had "terrorism" to Dragnea after his meeting in March 2007.
However, PSD leader Mircea Geoana said he had met with Basescu and Prime Minister Emil Boc before electing Dragnea.
According to Geoana, Basescu received the PSD proposal as "right and institutional" and said the new ruling coalition does not want to undermine the ruling coalition.
"Dragnea has all the qualifications and accomplishments needed for this important framework.
"The presence of the decentralisation will be confidence in a constant stance of this broad process on Romania 'decentralisation," he said.
"Everything has acknowledged," PSD President Ion Illiescu said. "It was optimistic, no optimism."
He added that Dragnea would be "very useful" in the interior ministry, where Dragnea has three times as head of the Teleorman Council.
Iliescu said the candidacy has strengthened internal affairs ministries, not the military.
Dragnea said the main goals will increase public security, including schools, and to implement decentralisation and reforms.
Although the new prime minister will have to give up the province 'letter, Giurgiu and Clargiu will continue to preserve the PSD branches in the province.
Former Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, who heads the opposition National Liberal Party (PNL), welcomed the elections, saying the PSD has shown a limited coup.
The National Anti-Corruption Agency is being investigated by the National Anti-Corruption Agency in a case on the use of EU funds, but the agency reported that it was closed later.
In 2000, the new prime minister took part in the PDL, then from the Democratic Party, the PDL, and the PSD was appointed as president of the party in 2005.
Dragnea replaces Gabriel Oprea, who was forced to resign by the party, after the Virgil Ardelean is controversial country to bring its intelligence services.

EBRD President Jean Lemierre confirmed during a visit to Tirana in early September that the institution is interested in development projects in Albania.
The Bank will donate funding in April 2005 to build a thermal power plant in the southern city of Vlora.
"We are awaiting for the construction of the thermal power plant, which will solve the problem of electricity cuts in the southern part of Albania," Lemierre said.
The work on the project, considered the most important project in the Albanian energy sector over the past 20 years, is expected to begin in early 2005 and complete in two years.
The EBRD is one of the main funding for the construction of the thermal power plant in Albania.

Romania Urges EU Economic Economy
The presence of a labour market economy is one of the key requirements the country must meet to complete its accession talks.
Romania hopes that the EU report is approaching this cheaper.
(Wall Street Journal, Rompres, Mediafax, European Commission of Romania - 20 / 09 / 04; SEE Europe - 16 / 09 / 04; EurActiv - 03 / 09 / 04)
Romanian President Ion Iliescu said on Monday (September 20th) that his country will complete its accession talks with the EU by the end of this year and get the chance to join the Union in 2007. [AFP]
Romanian chief negotiator with the EU, Vasile Puscas, voiced hope on Monday (September 20th) that the country is on the way to recognise a functioning market economy, one of the key requirements the country must meet its accession talks with the Union.
"We hope that Romania will be accepted as a functioning market economy, which will have the capacity of full functioning functioning within the EU internal market conditions, if reforms are under the EU accession date," Puscas said in a press release.
Romania, which has completed 25 of the 31 negotiating chapters so far, wants to complete its accession talks with Brussels by the end of this year and join the EU in 2007.
Nevertheless, the EC Chief of Romania, Jonathan Scheele, said in a press release Monday that the report would focus on the status of the market economy, which is one of the two economic alcohol criteria for membership.
He added that the second alt crisis -- competitiveness pressure and its capacity to deal with market forces in the Union -- will only be necessary until 2007.
As Bulgaria recognised as a functioning market economy in 2002, the EC report said that if it continues to implement the reform programme to eliminate the remaining challenges "for the country, competitive pressure and market forces should be able to deal with the mid-term."
Bulgaria completed talks with the Union last year.
The EC called for effective and continuous implementation of structural reforms on Romania, and called on the country 'effective market economy as a functioning market economy, if it continues to be determined ", the EC said in a network report on Romania.
While praising Romania for reforms that has so far been made, the EC cited the need for a continuous reduction of precautionary fiscal and wage policies and financial proposal.
The commission also called on the country to make progress in spending reforms, increase tax efficiency, resolving the budget and energy sector, resolving the problem of the short-term and long-term gas prices, which reflects short-term and long-term goods.
In late August, EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said Romania would not be "disaster" if it does not complete negotiations by the end of December.
"We still will still be a year to ensure Romania will join by 1 January 2007," Verheugen said.
On Monday, however, Romanian President Ion Iliescu expressed his commitment to complete the accession talks by the end of the year.
Iliescu underlined Romania efforts to implement reforms within the past two years, as well as incidents submitted to foreign investors.
He acknowledged that the government had two months to work in front of the European Commission to convince the negotiations.
Development Economy Reconstruction?
Free prices and competitiveness are crucial to the right distribution of resources. [SE Times] The importance of the development of former Romanian Finance Minister and economist Daniel Daianu, public administration and institutional governance.
According to Daianu, these factors are the overall performance of the economy.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 20 / 10 / 03
Free market market and competitiveness are crucial to the right distribution of resources.
To encourage the initiative and encourage commercial activities, property rights must be defined and preserved. In every area, the small budget restrictions should be implemented in order to ensure stability. In the long term, the small budget deficits must be implemented, Para is is the negative consequences for the parallel stability.
At the same time, however, it would be an obstacle to the creation of dozens of dozen policies that need to serve certain interests.
At the beginning of the year, we have been able to reach a compromise on specific issues that economists have been discussed for years.
This uncertainty could lead to a more open debate between policies and government advisers.
These issues are particularly interested in the situation of developing countries:
Although the Free trade is viewed as a reason for many economists, broad asymic monasteries and dynamic effects are caused to protect some countries that have developed.
The free trade, such as Deni Rodrik, is not always caused economic growth.
Even more than a month ago, the trade talks in Cancin have not been made, but reminded the difference between the rich countries' said agricultural subsidies (agricultural subsidies) is known to all.
Free capital flows were seen as very dangerous for developing markets.
The IMF has no longer proposed the opening of capital account, although it is not in accordance with institutional and interim conditions.
With the restructuring of a lack of co-ordination, the restructuring of the public is the beginning to be considered a logical precondition in the economic intervention.
Several financial crisis and heavy crisis, such as energy trade, are difficult to overcome serious bodies, arrangements, arrangements and legal arrangements in the functioning of markets, as well as the challenge of the state, according to some of the formation of "interim state" that markets are more preliminary.
The government cannot play a role in the supply of public goods.
In addition, some have suggested the inclusion of extraordinary and technological developments is part of the government.
A series of defence programmes in the EU and the United States could be described as an example of intellectual policies.
The monetary policy could be detailed in a world with major asylum metric methods, if surprising is frozen.
Several economic vehicles that are developed and developed are being used to achieve national economic targets, such vehicles could be used to increase internal austerity.
What is the World economy responsible for the production of public goods?
Do you think there are no communication and functioning responsibility for this issue, including co-ordination of different policies in the world economy to prevent inequality?
Economists also highlighted the importance of markets on the distribution of resources and reward initiative, while governments continue to discuss economic role.
This controversy won the new Teors, which is also admitted by Robert Gilpin,: example, for example, is the possibility of a constant bad bad balance economy, "he said." The basic stance of the mechanism [that] is the basic stagnitarian growth, such as the
New Teorists, which are based on former development economies, are attracting good revival.
Albert Hirschman, Paul Rosenstein Roden, Ragnar Nurkg, Gunnar Myrdal, Harvey Lekim and many other economists emphasised the role of institutions in poor countries, and the structural fraud that have taken part in various circumstances.
In this point, it needs a "Greeks", as Roden is defined in the 1943 concept of the development.
In an ongoing debate on the development economy, many former issues are discovered.
In this consensus, external effects that have a problem in terms of public policies are repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly, such as external intellectuals, roads, returns and "little development".
Both national and international policies are open to the success of governments, as well as the failure of the market co-ordination.
In this context, the public administration and institutional administration must understand the truth of the functioning institutions and accordance with the overall performance of the economy.
The major differences on economic performance in countries in the period of transition (post) exists from institutional structures and different functions in policies.
In most of the countries that have developed outside China and India, the economic progress in the field of economic progress has been disappointed in many of the post-communist countries, post transit transition and "control" in many of the post-communist countries, we are stopping the new development of a new development economy.
Economists, such as Olivier Blanchard, Paul Krugman, Deni Rodrik and Joseph Stiggyz, can achieve more realistic and credibility in development economies.

However, these movement has caused criticism. According to Kimler, the elections will block the existing issue -- Greece and the name dispute with Greece.
The dispute does not block the country 'invitation to join the NATO summit in Bucharest, but the EU could also affect the start of accession talks.
During the Bucharest summit, NATO leaders agreed that if Athens and Skopje reach a compromise, Macedonia could decide to invite Macedonia at the embassy level without waiting the next summit.
US Ambassador to NATO Victoria Nuland, who met with Prime Minister Gruevski and President Branko Crvenkovski, said the dispute on the name dispute should not be resolved in "months or weeks".
The issue is still on the agenda of NATO, while Skopje wants to work to ensure a consensus "benefit".
However, the opposition Social Democrats, during a long-standing debate on the dismantling of parliament, accused Gruevski of turning his allies and instead of dealing with an internal political war.
Addressing members of the law board, Crvenkovski said he had agreed that Greece should be reconciliated with Greece, and voiced hope that the latest offer of international mediator Matthew Nimetz -- the Republic of Macedonia (Skopje) -- is ready to accept its name.
In any case, Macedonia -- both NATO and the EU -- has now received a comprehensive chance of partnership with the EU.

The EU has submitted eight prices to Macedonia, and the European Commission (EC) is essential to fulfil these conditions, even to assess the start of talks.
However, the EC will be difficult to fulfil these conditions until September, when it comes to the election in June.
A new government will be formed at the summer.
Meanwhile, the distribution of parliament has also restricted bilateral talks with Greece.
The government, which has been blocking the effects and significant decisions, is now technically working.
While Washington argues that Macedonia is strong in its partnership, the United States could be able to give the Balkans less than the approach of the upcoming elections.
NATO membership is seen as an important milestone, not only as an important milestone, but also a major importance for Macedonia 'stability. Although the Ohrid Agreement signed in 2001, the country must still work on a multiethnic ethnic democracy.
The institutions have a fragile structure and uncertainty on membership, creating a negative environment for the Macedonian economy, which is weakened.
In the country, the trade deficit is 113m euros, and the unemployment rate is 35 per cent.
It needs more foreign direct investment to resolve these problems, but the uncertainty climate after the Bucharest summit does not make Macedonia more attractive for investors.
Economic shortages and institutional problems could lead to restructuring nationalist discriminations, especially after Kosovo declared independence.
The Macedonian-Kosovo border has not yet been undermined, and separate groups may be encouraging developments in the region.
"If Macedonia is now entering NATO, I am very serious that the country will continue to remain ten years later," International Crisis Group Edward Joseph said in an interview with him on March 21st.
I am very worried because I fear the Macedonian identity is in dangerous by its neighbours, "he said.
The opposition Social Democrats and Liberal Democrats are leaving the session after the vote on the distribution of parliament in Skopje on 12 April. [Getty Images]
Albanian prime minister Sali Berisha expressed concern that Macedonia will be able to overcome the radical trend in the country if it comes to NATO.
"It is a matter that should be resolved and resolved," Berisha told the BBC.
The elections in Macedonia are expected to be a substantial debate, increasing and celebrating rhetoric rhetoric.
During the debate on the dissolution of parliament, the Social Democrats charged that the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party is "violent" in the campaign.
The opposition also said the Gruevski administration has been preparing for the elections, because the ruling party -- the appointment of the new State Election Committee -- and not allowed some key laws to parliament -- such as an arrangement on the right to equal access to the state media agencies.
For politicians in Macedonia, which has been closed due to Greece &aposs Cvetu and ethnic tensions in the country, the electoral campaign will be difficult to exercise nationalism.
"Both political sites in Macedonia will fight themselves with each other, which is now very important.
"It is an extent to Europe," he said.

Turkey must strengthen border controls to join the EU, and its membership in the 27-nation bloc will have a variety of risks, a group of British lawmakers said in a report on Monday (August 1st).
Turkey began accession talks with the EU in October 2005, but many EU member states are not opposed to full membership.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule, a member of the Eurozone Interior Committee, which prepares the report, said Turkey is not awaiting to join the bloc by 2020.
Turkey will be based on the EU foreign borders, Syria, Iraq and Iran, if EU members joined the northern border between Bulgaria and Greece, the southern and southeastern neighbours, the bloc will join the EU.
English lawmakers, who have made it clear that Turkey has made it clear to EU membership, described the border with Turkey, the Muslim part of the population, as "the main illegal point of immigrants" to the Union.
"As of October 2010, 46 per cent of unilateral immigrants at the EU 'external borders were held at the border with Greece and Turkey, and officials say that nearly 350 immigrants are trying to limit the border near Orestia, Greece," the report said.
A group of experts from the EU border agency Frontex arrived in November last year to help Greece on increasing fugitives.
The number of fugitives from the border has dropped more than 4.5 months -- 7.67 in October 2010 -- dropped to 1.632 in February 2011 -- the decline in Europe in recent months.
The committee also suggested that the institution has changed amendments to the operations, saying it would create a working environment in co-operation with Turkish border agencies, while Turkish border agencies also praised the continued efforts to ensure better management of immigrants.
"Greece and Turkey, as well as the European and international security services, have to share intellectual intelligence and work together," said Keith Vaz, a member of the Labour Party and committee.
Turkish drug newspapers have said that the 27-nation bloc is a serious threat to internal security, members of the committee said, noting that 80 per cent of its predecessor from Afghanistan and Central Europe came through Turkey.
According to EU police, South American passengers from South American, Turkey and the Balkans have been increasing in recent years, according to the EU police service.
While the amount of kidnapping to the EU market is on track, Turkish officials said, the amount of kidnapping by Turkish officials has increased in the past few years, the amount of the amount that has been arrested on the Iber Pension.
Lawmakers also expressed concern about local criminal organisations' human trafficking activities, which are under Turkey, or in this country.
According to the Committee, "The EU must hold arrangements in order to fight organised crime and immigration in an effective fight against organised crime and immigration, Turkey must be able to receive some member states before joining the Union."
The new Turkish Assembly also said that ahead of the accession, the country must take effect of a database law that would provide a more high-level co-operation between the country officials and Dnevnikol.

Since Ivanovic is a member of a European Parliament (EP) that is a member of the ruling GERB party in Bulgaria.
Ivanova launched an initiative to remove Bulgarian workers' restrictions, six months after the EP appointed office in December 2009.
The initiative won a strong supporter earlier this month: Bulgarian football star Hristo Stoickov.
SETimes speaks about the initiative with Ivanovic.
SETimes: What progress has been made since the start of the campaign?
In April 2010, I proposed a mechanism to advance EU lawmakers' recommendations on the economic crisis.
He focuses on a positive effect on the improvement of enlargement and workers' free movement of workers and improvement of the internal market.
The EP 'Committee for the Protection of Ilic and Contemporary Protection approved a method calling on Bulgarian workers to review their positions of all EU member states that have implemented restrictions.
Following a meeting of our initiative on ways to boost the impact on the EU member states, Bulgarian Parliament Speaker Ttiska Tsaa sent letters to Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Britain.
I also met with the ambassadors of these countries and the EP colleagues.
SETimes: What is the realistic to expect the work restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian workers to be removed by 2012?
Ivanova: I believe it is the most realistic.
On June 18th, the EC launched a public research on discrimination in some EU member states, as well as the free movement of human and workers, as well as the discrimination of people faced in some EU member states.
The survey can focus on all EU languages and on the Internet or paper by August 12th.
The EC aims to evaluate its main obstacles and implement equal treatment of free movement and workers.
Another reason for optimism is that I am responsible for the second written to the EC.
Laslo Andor, a commission member in charge of the study, said the second transition period (2011) would require concrete and detailed evidence to continue restrictions from member states that want to extend more than two years.
SETimes: How do you think that you have the EU colleagues and Bulgarians are on the EU labour market?
Ivanova: They have full support.
In addition to the EP lawmakers, the values of the unified market is the most free movement of people and deeper it.
I was not supported by the Dutch EP member Marije Cornelen, and I was surprised in a tolerance.
Cornelissen opposes restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian workers, and organised a television debate on the opening of labour markets.
SETimes: Is Hristo Stojkov 'idea to join the campaign?
Ivanova: We have decided that this could affect Stojkov 'popular popularity, determination and professionalism' success and that the campaign can help the campaign.
The campaign, including Stojkov, shows that workers in the new EU member states can contribute to the common EU market.
SETimes: How do you plan special initiatives, such as Stojkov, to send letters to EU member states to open the labour markets?
Ivanova: Following the letter, we will hold a meeting of a partnership with the Romanian colleagues in the EP.
We want to invite popular figures who agreed to participate in the campaign, including Stojkov.
Furthermore, loans in BiH await for difficult days

Furthermore, relations with friends and families are always the end of the female movies that have not been able to repay their debts.
According to the BiH Association for Protection, 19 explosives have been excellent over the past three years.
"They signed a contract to take the debts of those who do not pay their debt, but there is no institutional protection," Association President Jovica Cvetkovic told SETimes.
Cvjetkovic said that many have been seeking to help the family, friends and witnesses, but many people are trying to help us help us.
According to the Association data, around 200,000 minutes have been discovered, mostly by friendship or labour.
In a country that faces heavy economic crisis, BiH could become a member of the group 'group.
The problems related to the hearings have revealed the privatisation of the banking sector in 2002 and the arrival of foreign banks in BiH.
The loan expansion of the public, which was created by the bottom debt, continued to give the global economic crisis in 2008.
"The banks have valuable contracts and they can be able to take the movies they are equal with debt.
Banks want to collect the debt as soon as possible, and they are aware that it could be more quickly, instead of accusing its debts to the case, "he said.
Bozic argues that the debts are created by a system that allows more banks and some loans to get loans from credit organisations.
"Initially, the BiH central bank was not a Borc Kaydon (MBK), and therefore people have the debt that they will not pay for people, but some debts have begun to avoid the excessive debt," he said.
The Association has requested a systematic solution to both sides and the BiH level, but the public has a campaign for information on the issue.
According to Cvjetkovic, the aim of the campaign is to track the films, to defend the amendments and monitoring of the valuable laws in this area, and to punish the excellent profit.
The Republika Srpska Finance Ministry has even drafted a law to protect the films.
The Association administration hopes that the bill on clients' rights and obligations in the contract with banks would prevent people 'excessive external debt to those who are excessive.
The BiH banking Agency, however, claims that this issue has been focused on the Law on Rights, and advises the judges of the death films to court.
Everybody, which acknowledges the sovereignty, has acknowledged the obligations of the main debt, and that all the problems that live, must be addressed by courts, the agency said.
Some changes have started to find a solution to the system, the agency said.
Since January, the agency has been blocking a new loan for extremist people.
Nevertheless, problems that have been given hundreds of people are under way.
"The law will be to impose institutional pressure on banks if the need to rescue the movie obligations will not be really realistic, a bridge solution, payment delays or debt payment is completely stopped.
However, all options related to the debt should be the beginning of the forecasts, "he said.

He resigned a change in civilian relations.
By Alakbar Raufoglu for Southeast European Times -- 01 / 08 / 11
Chief of General Staff Iaff Kohaner was among those who were instructed. [Reuters]
Chief of General Staff Ion Kohaner resigned on Friday (July 29th), along with the commanders of air and Mediterranean forces, sparked shock in Ankara.
The funds were announced only a few days before the Supreme Military Storm (YAS), a high-ranking meeting, which was made from August 1st to August 1st and resigned.
According to media reports, the military arrangement is now seeking early pension to protest that more than 250 officers are currently under custody against the government.
Although the prime minister and the president approved the military 'recommendations as traditional, the government and the military have increased tensions over the missile of military officers.
Addressing the "armed cards", Order General Kohaner said his mandate is impossible because of a mistake judiciary process.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has declared a new chief of staff, the Commander of the Jandarian Forces, General Necdet Ozel, without losing the time.
Furthermore, the chief of the general staff had always been commander of the force.
According to analysts, the resignation shows increasingly rights on the military, in a country that has witnessed three military couples and the army to intervene significant intervention in politics.
Salih Kapusk, the leader of Erdogan, said everything is in accordance with the procedure, but stressed that the resignation does not affect the army 'order or functioning.
"Turkey has implemented democracy and law procedures," he told SETimes, calling the resignations "no more than a early pension."
"He acknowledged the real reasons for his resignation," he said, adding that "a third entity, or even the government," when independent investigations are questioned. "
However, it has been criticised by many, because of the investigation into couple plans, politically, and arrest suspects' detention.
"This is not a part of the criminal investigation," said the CHP deputy head of the parliamentary group, Azerbaijan Hamzopen. "We are under control of the government," he said.
"The government wants to restore its own phases," he told SETimes.
Oktay Vural, the deputy head of the MHP and parliamentary group, says the investigations were used for failing to cover the image of the army, which is the most valuable institution of the country.
"There are concerns that investigations related to the government against conspiracy have been concerned that the army is destroying the reputation of the army," Vural told SETimes.
Meanwhile, the Middle Asia-Caucasus Institute and the Studies Study Programme of Studies, Halil Karavani of the Central Asia Caucasus, says the generals resigned, rather than send a coup or send secret threats.
"This is doing everything," he told SETimes.
Therefore, it is also a chance for good relations between civil authorities and the army. "
"In the long term, I expect the government to take steps to strengthen the position of General Ozel in the military," he added.
Turkish defence analyst and the Institute for Security and Development Policy, the new Kemal Kay, believes recent developments pointed to a fight against secularism among Islamists.
"The crisis seems to be resolved with the appointment of Necdet Special 'general staff.
However, in the coming days, we must expect new developments in the crisis between civil servants and military circumstances. "

He added that Serbian authorities have been searching a solution that would not show themselves in the parliamentary elections next year.
According to analyst Dusan Janjic, Belgrade has chosen its responsibilities to the international community and accusing KFOR and NATO.
Janjic told SETimes that it could "turn into new conflicts with these organisations that Serbia must be partners in resolving the crisis".
"The contention of the parliamentary declaration was dangerous," he said.
Serbian President Boris Tadic has accused some of using the international community to pressure on Serbia on the enlargement process.
"There is no better aspect of the dialogue, but Serbia will not accept any change in the north of Kosovo and Metohija and the benefit of European integration," Tadic told B92 media.
Tadic said that if Kosovo recognises independence is a condition for membership in any way, Serbia would be 'no'.
In Serbian public, there are different views on how to be done.
"I do not think that the government of the European future because the Kosovo Albanians do not want Serbia for more than ten years and that Kosovo Albanians do not want to live in Serbia," Belgrade resident Isidora Kravljanac, 38, told SETimes.
The EU said it has sent Robert Cooper as a mediator to resolve the border crisis.
Meanwhile, two representatives of the Serbian government, Borko Stefanovic and Goran Bogdanovic arrived in northern Kosovo to discuss the Serb community.
Media reports reported that the two were entered in Kosovo after the removal of the Lithuanian border crossings.

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) must co-operate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and fulfil the requirements of the EU, High Representative Paddy Ashdown said on Sunday (December 19th).
"For BiH, it is a single task that does not change the resignation and will only be postponed with the elections, which will continue co-operation with the ICTY and continue EU reforms," Ashdown said on Sunday. "We will be delayed until we do so."
Ashdown announced last week that a number of measures would be taken to resolve business and safety issues, as BiH refused to co-operate with the UN tribunal this year due to its failure to co-operate with the UN tribunal, he said on Thursday.
These measures have also found that Republika Srpska (RS), the Serb entity in the Serbian administration, has been on the list of most wanted indictees, and that Ratko Mladic, reportedly reportedly celebrated a military facility in eastern BiH earlier this summer, continued to preserve Ratko Mladic.
The measures, including nine Bosnian Serb police and intelligence officials, were removed from the post of the bank accounts of individuals suspected in relationship with war crimes, were resigned by RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic and BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic.
Several other Bosnian Serb officials from Ivanic 'Democratic Progress Party (PDP) have submitted their resignation or are expected to submit it until Tuesday.
Borislav Paravac, the chairman of the BiH tripartite presidency, said he would leave the post if the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) demands a request.
Bosnian Muslim representative of the BiH presidency, Sulejman Tihic, said RS politicians hope they would not take decisions that will jeopardise the functioning of state level authorities.
Tihic described the measures as "the interest of RS and BiH citizens".
"It is very important that the quality of the measures we have been exercised and the implementation of these resignations," Ashdown said on Sunday. "I am not the aim of the measures to punish the RS people.
The aim of these measures is open and logical -- to ensure that RS is necessary to ensure that BiH can move forward to Dayton, it is necessary for time and vehicles. "
The Bosnian Serb entity has responded from Washington to not co-operate.
During a joint press conference with Ashdown on Thursday, US Ambassador Douglas McElhaney said his country has decided to ban the SDS to enter the money laundering with the party.
He added that both the SDS and the PDP managers have been restricted to travel.

European leaders, who took a major step in the EU enlargement process, have been the green light for the signing of accession agreements with Bulgaria and Romania, Croatia and Turkey to launch accession talks in 2005.
"We have made significant consequences on the future of Europe," European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Friday (December 17th) at the end of the two-day EU summit in Brussels.
The summit also highlighted the stalemate of talks on Cyprus between the EU presidency and Turkish officials.
Furthermore, Ankara has been offered to sign a protocol that will enable the comprehensive customs union agreement to expansion Cyprus and other nine new EU members, which would mean recognition of Cyprus.
However, the two sides agreed to reach a final minute consensu
EU leaders expressed confidence that Turkey will continue the reform process and guarantee basic freedom and human rights. The negotiation process, which is expected to continue until 15 years, will also include measures that have the right to suspend negotiations if Turkey does not meet its commitments.
Addressing a coach in Ankara on Saturday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the agreement reached in Brussels opened the way for a stronger democracy and better economic performance in the country.
"I can say that we are not 100 per cent of us, but I can say it is successful," Erdogan said. "We have come at a point that Turkey has taken its efforts for 41 years," he said.
Another important step in the enlargement process, European leaders agreed to begin Croatia 'accession talks on 17 March 2005, making it a requirement for full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Following Zagreb to take the necessary steps, the EU called on the tribunal "to arrest and extradite fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina" as soon as possible and extradite to The Hague as soon as possible ".
The target that Croatia has been made more preventive is to join the EU in 2007 with Bulgaria and Romania.
However, experts believe 2009 is a possible date.
Bulgaria and Romania are on track to join the EU in January 2007, the Union leaders said on Friday, adding that these countries signed their accession agreements as a historic date for April 2005.
Both countries have acknowledged that their accession could be postponed if they do not success in implementing reforms.
Serbian discrimination problem is the target of the inspection of the inspection
The activist, which has been fighting violence for years, says the general climate is not equal, especially for women and minorities.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 25 / 04 / 11
Serbian Enlargement Commissioner Nevena Petrusic. [EU]
Serbian Affairs Commissioner for Protection Nevena Petrusic, who has been in office for more than a year, has been falling with problems such as the right.
In this exclusive interview with SETimes correspondent Igor Jovanovic, the former Nis Law Foundation, Petrusic, tells SETimes that discrimination has a society in the society, and that people will not be easy to change.
SETimes: Women, if the country has 51 per cent of the population of the country, the men working at the same time are less wage, and the law has a low turnout in judicial and judiciary.
How do you assess the reality of women in the Serbian community?
Nevena Petrusic: Women and men in Serbia have equal rights, but women are intellectual, intellectual and even direct discrimination, and even the basic reason is that they have traditional and religious responsibility for the family and society.
According to researchers, women -- especially those who are from ethnic minorities and minority groups, Roma, refugees, poverty, poverty rates, different sexual trends -- have a difficult position in each social life.
Petrusic says women employees won less than 16 per cent compared to their colleagues. [Reuters]
The data revealed that women are not involved in the process of decision. Only 21.2 per cent of Serbian lawmakers, 21.3 per cent of municipal assembly members and 18.5 per cent of the ministers' ministries.
The number of municipalities is limited to 4 per cent.
The discrimination against women shows it in economic data.
The unemployment rate in women is more than two times.
The difference between women and men 'salaries is 16 per cent.
Women are taking 30.5 per cent of the government and the economy, and 20.8 per cent of them are administrative tasks.
The economic unemployment level, a result of intellectual discrimination, is high.
As it comes to education, women are still in a weak position.
If the society must say, the unemployment between women and women and men is almost completely eliminated, but some minority groups are still at large, especially in rural areas, with children who live in rural areas and insufficient inefficiency.
With the high education levels, young women are increasingly increasingly on the level of participation and female student swimming, it is losing at the state levels.
Aand sexual violence, women smugglers and other violence based on smuggling and abuse.
Studies by NGOs are particularly undermined by these issues, because the violence based on Cinsule is not recognised by the state level.
Women who are discriminating and discrimination are discriminated by women.
The existing mechanisms that enhance legal protection against violence are not implemented in the bridge. Ne police have any protocol on the tasks of this issue, nor a multilateral connection between institutions and institutions.
Roman women are "the most dangerous part of the population", Petrusic told SETimes. [Reuters]
Women in the court process of protecting violence are imposed to a second balance, and they are not enough social assistance and support.
Roman women are seeking discrimination, especially in terms of safe homes and women, as well as their discrimination, as they use the rights of violent violence based on abuse.
SETimes: Do you have special social assistance programmes for Roma women to join the community?
Petrusic: The average life of Roma women is really really really, with 48 years of life.
The situation of Roma women in Serbia is not improved without sufficient discrimination measures.
The measures to improve the situation of the Roma population should also be developed, and private measures should also be developed by Roma women, and there are two discriminatory discrimination because they are both women and the Roma community.
The measures to provide more education and employment image of Roma women are crucial, because the judges are now used to be very restricted due to ethnic and insurance preliminary judges.
SETimes: How many complaints have been reported since the inauguration opened?
Do citizens complain the most discrimination practices?
Petrusic: We live in a country where he is widely widespread in both private areas and the public fields of public affairs, the spread of women, foreign decrease, sexual decrease, hidden and gas discrimination, even today.
Therefore, we want to create a democratic, deficit and tolerance society, democratic, open and tolerance, and we are opposed to challenges to combat discrimination.
The adoption of the anti-discrimination law is only the first step, and the second step should be implemented.
So far, more than 200 complaints have been complained, with men from the Protection Commission, and women are women and about 20 complaints from NGOs.
People are the most frequent and discrimination in employment areas, and there is no ethnic political party or a certain political party.
In addition, we also received six complaints on the incidents of sexual minorities.
Of course, our citizens do not know that discrimination is not full, and this concept is that any right is violated, violation of any right, not in accordance with themselves, and there is no situation that some judges have been sentenced.
Therefore, there is a lot of things that can understand the education of people and thus have to identify their goods and to be able to protect them.
SETimes: How do you have enough authority to determine sanctions for those who violate the laws?
Petrusic: There is a good legal framework for protecting discrimination in Serbia, and this legal framework today enables the effect of the impression of the code, penal code and cafes.
I think that this authority is widely designed to fight any discrimination, as it comes to the authority of the Protection of Affairs.
Another part of the area, concrete discrimination cases are closing.
As part of the law on the complaints of the commission, the commission is under way, and the commissioner may be able to open the case and require protection against discrimination, the commissioner has announced a crime.
I want to understand the authority of the Commission to propose a mediator in discrimination cases.
He is the fifth increase of discrimination that the actions of discrimination will take responsibility and how they have an effect on the victims of their behaviour, which is unacceptable.
I think this is the best method to prevent discrimination.
EU approves aid to Turkish Cypriots
EU foreign ministers approved a 139m-euro aid package to northern Cyprus.
The agreement could be possible after the articles allowing Turkish Cypriots from direct trade between the EU member states.
(FT, EUobserver, Financial Mirror - 27 / 02 / 06; AP, AFP, Zaman, Cyprus Mail - 26 / 02 / 06; Cyprus News Agency - 25 / 02 / 06)
"The main step that Turkey is waiting for accession is direct, with the aid of financial assistance.
This unilateral decision by the EU will bring new problems and challenges, "he said. [AFP]
EU foreign ministers adopted a decision Monday (February 27th) to open the way for the Turkish Cypriot community of 139m euros.
The aid will be used to improve the infrastructure and the economy of the island.
The agreement, which has been awaiting for 18 months because of the Greek Cypriot side 'appeal to provisions on trade between northern Cyprus and EU members, took place on Friday that the EU Permanent Committee (COREPR) accepted Nicosia' request for the issue of financial support.
"The goal of the COREPER is to create a better environment that would boost co-operation between the two communities and increase the chances of talks to resolve the Cyprus issue," Greek Cypriot administration spokesman George Lillias said on Saturday.
On Monday, Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Paris on Tuesday.
A Greek Cypriot official said the move is to facilitate the restructuring of peace talks.
Ankara, however, has criticised Brussels for charges of unilateral prosecutors.
Turkey wants the money to take part in a greater package, including direct trade between Turkish Cypriots and 25 EU member states.
"The main step Turkey expects is directly exercised with financial assistance," Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told the Financial Times. "This unilateral decision is the EU will bring new problems and challenges."
Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot authorities have expressed their withdrawal of a door rating on Friday, in which the COREPR approved by Friday, and the communities' communities would be allowed to trade with EU member states.
Ahead of a referendum on the UN plan to end the division of Cyprus in April 2004, the EU vowed that the state, which declared itself, would help foster the poor economic situation in the Turkish Cypriot community in the poor situation, which was recognised by Turkey.
In a referendum, Greek Cypriots rejected the UN peacekeeping plan, while the majority of Turkish Cypriots approved the plan. On 1 May 2004, only the EU represented the island as a member of the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot side.
The proposal, approved by the EU at the end of the month, envisions mechanisms that would allow the Turkish Cypriot community to combat direct trade with EU member states.
However, some of the fund has been given for a part, and the first Turkish Cypriots have spent 120m euros from the planned plan.

The debate over the construction of a discovered mosque during the BiH conflict is symbolised by reconciliation challenges in the eastern part of the country.

A Orthodox church in the Bosnian town of Divic, near Zvornik, includes a Orthodox church on the architecture of a time mosque.
Although the local administration has been under way to solve ethnic relations, it is said to be symbolised to symbolise the challenges of reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Muslim Muslims who returned to Divic after the BiH conflict demanded the reconstruction of the church and reconstruction of the mosque, while local authorities preferred to leave the church for another search for the mosque and leave the church.
Local governance has paid 30,000 euros as a minimum of the mosque of the Islamic community, and the human rights commissioner in BiH ordered the new mosque to the Zvornik municipality as the final judiciary.
Zvornik administrative officer Dragan Jeftic said he has already been offered two searches, but the Islamic community has rejected both.
The situation prompted the protests of Muslims and the fresh of the church.
One of the protesters, Behara Eftic, said there is no exception of the church, but added that it would be better to regain Muslims' mosques.
During the incident, Divic arrived in other parts of BiH.
The name was changed as Saint Stefan, one of the lowest Serbian market.
However, only one Serb lives in the village.
Risto Cutic has repeatedly appealed to pensions and neighbours.
He was attacked and forced to intervene police, when the airline was made.
The tensions on the Camii problem are also spread from the poor economic situation in the region.
Many of the 185 families in Divic have a diplomacy, but only a few members have continued work.
He says the people have come up with humanitarian aid and small pensions.
Serbia faces sale of power plants
While there is no money to meet the environmental standards or build a new mafia or new factory, Serbia &aposs power sector is an inevitable need for restructuring.
However, any move that the state power utility will likely face opposition.

EPS must invest 1 billion euros to meet European minimum standards. [EPS]
The Serbian government has no longer faced challenges.
Following pressure from the IMF to open a tender for the privatisation company (NI) last autumn, the government announced it would elect a "strategic adviser" for Serbian Electricity Industry (EPS), citing the average.
The move was allocated that the company will be sold to the privatisation and refineries.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, the advisory company will need to "create a consortium for the development of the company through restructuring and investment, and to determine the best privatisation model".
A 350m loan from the World Bank to open this tender, the future of EPS and the price of the public will be based on the outcome of the tender for electricity.
The price of electricity is likely to be able to cover two and a half times, but it will be one of the lowest prices in the region due to subsidies.
EPS is very clear that something should be done.
The company must invest 1 billion euros in order to meet European minimum standards, but there is no money.
As of now, Serbia could meet most of its electricity energy needs, but at least one thermal power plants and a coastal power plant in five years will need, and their goods will be changed between 750m euros and 1 billion euros.
The government has no option to raise prices to meet the costs of the EPS due to its electricity prices.
Instead, electricity prices in Serbia are at the level of "socialist", instead of defining market prices.
EPS pays at least 80m euros annually to imports of electricity, but the same electricity is sold from one third of the market market prices.
The World Bank supports efforts to restructuring the energy market, but says it should not leave the cautious.
David Kennnedy, a senior economist of the Bank, says the Bank does not want the privatisation of the EPS, but instead that any privatisation plan should be prepared.
The government was first steps in this direction with workers unions and reactions by the EPS administration.
They also charge about 40,000 people worked and that the company will be part of the company worth billions of euros.
The best hydropower plants and thermal power plants, as well as electricity distribution companies, which have an efficient payment service service, will also be alone.
Experts, meanwhile, are concerned about the efficiency of the system, and some argue that integration systems can only provide a safe electricity supply.
This issue is a problem in other countries in Eastern Europe, while the Ceks, Hungarians and Poland are even more attempted to integration their systems.
The situation is not different in Bulgaria, where the Czech CEZ company, the owner of the electricity distribution companies and potential alcohol production stations, is in the country.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose representatives of the EU Telecommunications Group, responded to the question that Turkey would have a negative decision in December, that his country will continue to be disappointed, said Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

[The Copenhagen] political] criteria continue to transform the Ankara criteria, "he said.

Most of the former Soviet states in the Balkans have made some progress in democratic development over the past ten years, Freedom House said in a new study published on June 29th.
"In terms of the census, about 80% of the people living in the former Soviet Union -- 221 million people -- still live on the basic political rights," the US-based monitoring organisation said in its annual report.
The report cites Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Macedonia over the past decade "civil society and election process", as well as "fixed progress in other areas".
The study assesses democratic governments in 2009, with the development of the 29 countries from the region from the Middle East to Eurasia.
These include the election process, civil society, independent media, national and local governance, judicial independence and corruption.
The three groups are divided: new EU countries, including Bulgaria and Romania, and the former Soviet states, including Albania, BiH, BiH, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia.
One of the countries' highest democratic development is given a overall democracy rating from 1 to 7 to 7.
This rating represents the average of the scores in each country &aposs individual categories.
In 2009, only five countries -- Belarus, Kosovo, Lithuania, Macedonia and Serbia -- have improved a total of democracy rates, while Albania, BiH, BiH, Romania, have won the previous number of other countries' report, including Romania.

BiH cited its overall democracy rating from 5.17 in 2001 to 404 in 2007.
In recent years, the new report caused a smaller drop in the country 'rating from 4.25 to 25.
According to that, BiH was classified as a "transition government or mechanism", with both Ukraine and Georgia, which ranked 4.99.
Freedom House, noting that Kosovo has improved the most frequent improvement in 2009, the report replaces the "injuries" group, including 5.97 overall democracy, Moldova and Armenia, with 5.99, with Moldova and Armenia.
"If the EU continues to be a clear strategy against each country in the region, especially Serbia, BiH could enter a slow pace, isolation and economic unemployment, and the potential of violence could be repeated," the organisation warned.

More than weeks ago, the international tournament has begun television for television.

Romania won a gold medal in three different categories, including automotiv, medicine and buyers at the Ceneva International Fair in the second year.
At the end of April, the fair was held at the Palestino facilities in Ceneva.
The fair participated in 780s from 45 countries.
Romania submitted 1,000 intellectuals.
Raluca Ioana van Morden won the best female award for his cycle, with an explosive exploitation of the cancer at the level.
Romanian television star Andreea Marin-Banica won the gold with the finance of an expansion for the price.
Student Corneliu Ntok-Bancha won the first in a car that reduced car consumption.
"The move is the test of the aircraft transfer.
"In part, the car has improved air flights and enabling a decrease to 20% in particular symbols," he said.
"I had the first movie in 2000, and then I started to test them on the car of their friends. In 2008, I revealed the transfer of air transplants, which was shot on the car of friendship," he said.
A specialised instigation in Bucharest has received support from a specialised insurance after the Stok-Bancha research survey and participated in the national intellectual fair in 2007.

What is Serbia ready for talks with Kosovo?
Belgrade still wants to repeat the status issue, but most Kosovo Serbs say they must focus on improving living conditions.

Following more than two years after the declaration of independence of Kosovo, Serbian leaders say they could be taken on the agenda of returning to the negotiation talks.
Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic is confident that the declaration of independence, expected by the International Court of Justice, is violating international law.
Authorities say the new status talks and the closure of an acceptable compromise for Belgrade could be closed if the outcome comes.
"One of the communities will have to give up up, and we are insisting that Kosovo will be," Serbian State Secretary for Kosovo Oliver Ivanovic said.
Many Kosovo Serbs, however, are on the siege.
According to High Representative Rada Trajkovic, Belgrade has no political event that must achieve a solution.
"Serbia has no clear strategy for political and security in terms of economic donors and undefined strategy for Kosovo and Metohija," Trajkovic told SETimes. "Even if these weaknesses can start negotiations on status, these are unsuccessful."
The technical talks on issues affecting the lives of Kosovo Serbs are more realistic, he said.
"If these talks are prepared, the Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church can strengthen the position of Kosovo," he said.
Trajkovic also urged Serbia to not leave any precautionary talks.
According to him, extremist Albanian groups have begun to restore extremist Albanian groups in Macedonia, and any opinion that Belgrade will appoint could lead to new conflicts.
Meanwhile, radical nationalists oppose the Belgrade talks -- which would mean the independence of Serbs in Kosovo -- to improve the conditions for Serbs in Kosovo.
"Technological talks are a lot for Serbia," Kosovo and Metohija Council Vice-President Marko Jaksic told SETimes. "We will not improve our life there, because we do not oppose the independence of Kosovo."
Meanwhile, Kosovo Serb refugees are waiting to see concrete improvement in the situation.
Many feel that Belgrade is doing less to help them, in all these negotiation rhetoric.
Since Ljijan and Strpci fled villages in 1999, Jelisavcic and Djurcevic share two rooms at the Belgrade suburb of Kalucerica.
Both families have been reducing themselves.
"The Society Bojan has two different complaints, a different model and a different model in the so-called software, and a different model in the centre-right network.
He was 38 others.
They also found a consortium in Belgrade, "he said.
"We have not been able to get children for ten years," Jelisavljevic added.
Social Affairs Minister Rasim Ljajic is opposed to the country ’ s Kosovo policy.
"Serbia has allocated 500m euros annually to Kosovo, but I am not sure that this money is the best way," Ljajic said.
Analysts say that if the negotiations continue, Serbia will likely seek different arrangements to Belgrade on its territory over the northern Kosovo and Serbian monasteries, with special, parallel relations.
"North Ireland, as well as all proposals proposed by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari in the plan are a good point," said Predrag Simic, the former Serbian ambassador to Paris and international law professor.
While acknowledging that Serbia has rejected the Ahtisaari plan, Simic noted that the 124-page UN Resolution 1244 and the Kumanovo Treaty had been accepted at a point.
Political analyst Dusan Janjic told SETimes that any aspect of the Kosovo independence issue is unlikely to change.
"The fact that Belgrade will begin talks with Brussels on the status of the crisis," Jancic said.
This would end Serbia on the path of Kosovo on its path to the EU, "he said.

The situation was very discovered and alcohol, according to the announcement.
"All this broadcaster can be able to have this broadcaster.
The Croats have made it a death issue, but one of the things in education reform is cultural differences and they have approved the law on civil currency and education, "he said.
Novi Several years ago, the political force in Brcko on whether Serbian students do not want to share the same school building with Muslims.
The Brcko problem has been forced and many agree that the Brcko education system, which has learned Croats, Muslims and Serbs.
Gunnarsdow said the parents could be a lot of behaviour.
"There are many people who do not remember their cultural heritage and their own language as long as they learned their own languages, but with other children, they can go to the same school.
The young people are not discrimination -- a worst of discrimination, and no longer closed in 2003, "he said.
Now, the canton ministries have been in order to respect the agreements.
However, the OHR finished the HDZ on August 25th to 20,452 euros on August 25th, as two of the schools did not release the legitimacy of unity until the date was set by a date.
These schools are hoping to receive an example of schools, which began last year in the municipalities of Vares and Zepce.
Another reform initiated this year is to increase the difficult education to nine years.
Furthermore, all 12 members of the 12-member currency committee, controversial mafia and restaurants from Bosniak textbooks, giving the history of war as true.

He said the next meeting of the committee would be always.

The first results of the general elections in Romania on Sunday (November 28th) showed that Prime Minister Adrian Nastase and the Social Democrats (PSD) leader, but the difference is less than the latest polls showed.
About 36 per cent of the vote, Nastase is in front of the top rival Traian Basescu, with 38 per cent of the vote in the presidential competition.
Vadim Tudor, a candidate of the nationalist Great Romania Party (PRM), won around 12 per cent of the vote, while Romania &aposs Democratic Alliance of Hungary (UDMR) won about 7 per cent.
Voter turnout was 57 per cent.
Nastase and Basescu will face a second round of elections on December 12th.
In the parliamentary elections, the PSD-Hosmanist Party, the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Party of Democratic Party (DP), Basescu is in front of the Justice and Chamber Alliance -- 33 per cent -- with 33 per cent.
The PRM has 13 per cent.
About 8 per cent of the UDMR achieved in the parliamentary elections is very close to the rate of Hungarians.
Other parties participating in the elections have failed to overcome the 5 per cent threshold of the 5 per cent threshold for a seat in parliament, and the total number of parties' candidates were 7 per cent.
However, this figure could be important in the second round.
The PSD leaders discussed their victory.
"Romania has proven more evidence that the PSD has been valuable in recent years.
We won the elections and we will start negotiations for the new cabinet, "he said.
However, Basescu said no party has failed to win more than half of the parliamentary seats, or not the right to bring Romania into the only one.
"The war... will be the second round of the presidential elections," Basescu said, noting that the prime minister was appointed and the president of the government to form a government.
The opposition also wants to open an investigation into the election allegations.
A independent group of 3300,000 observers in all countries, PSD supporters said the PSD supporters "have been abused to complain on the election irregularities until hundreds of votes were sparked by bus from a voting centre."
Following the pre-election pre-election preliminary warnings, Pobatia and other civil society organisations have said that irregularities -- 3 per cent -- could create a difference in the competition.
According to analysts, a number of cabinet scenarios is possible.
The ruling alliance, UMDR, the liberal opposition -- even some of the members of the liberal opposition -- could be united with the nationalist PRM -- if they see it as the last.
"The EU and the United States are known as this party, so I believe both the PSD and the DA Alliance will avoid," said Cristian Tudor Popescu, editor-in-chief of the Agiarul newspaper.

The 2nd Istanbul International Conference Forum, which ended on Tuesday (May 3rd) and ended on Thursday (May 3rd), found participants from around the world to invest the water problems for emergency solution.
While regional co-operation is on the basis of the meeting, the special agenda was the Middle East.
"The number of things that connect us are much more," World Winter Forum Secretary-General Oktay Tabasaran said, noting that the number of common regional interests have been united.
"Although Turkey does not have a rich country from water resources, it is not a factor, the faculty will not be a factor and will be able to meet domestic needs," Environment and Order Minister Veyim Eroglu said at the forum.
A major topic for Turkey is the check of barricades and hydropower plants that have been formed through Turkey, the number of increasing Dicle and First resources that have been able to control.
The barricades and water projects in the region of the Southeast European Anatolian Project (GEP), which has been developed in a bid to improve the economy of Turkey, one of the most poor areas of the country.
GAP supporters suggest that the project will also provide other benefits from resolving energy and economic problems, but tensions with Turkey could be used by the Kurds, sophic-economic development and integration.
According to GAP critics, Turkey will be less water to Syria and Iraq in the part of its rivers' rivers' however, so far, the problem has been caused by a smaller political problems between the three countries.
However, Chairra Ksia, head of the Arab Union for Studies and Arab Security Centre, is optimistic about the water fall between Turkey and Syria.
"Therefore, I think I am here.
Our relations between our countries are very good.
We have signed many protocol and were prepared on co-operation with Dicle. "
EU High Representative and NGOs official Imane Abd El Al is not optimistic, which assesses the offer for exporting Iraqi farmers in exchange of oil.
"We are talking about Mezopood," said Abd El Al, adding that "water imports and water [in a region], which is the balance of experience, is not a mistake, but a commercial product.
Mehmet Karpuzcu, a professor of the Gazikent University, opposed to these views, said that the countries that benefit from the barricades in Turkey must pay the price of this, and not all the water product is a product, but the infrastructure is a product.
While most of the consequences are politics, the water administration has not been a limited issue with politics.
"We have to share a fair share among people and countries, while we should not see the share of the share of any other responsibility between human and eastern," said World Chairman Loic Fauchon, for instance.

Two days after Macedonia was nominated as prime minister, Vlado Buckovski voiced confidence on Sunday (November 28th) that consultations on the new government will be completed within a week and that the new cabinet will be announced within a few days after the new cabinet is monitored.
Buckovski also promised that the opposition will be regular communication with the opposition.
After Macedonian Defence Minister Branko Crvenkovski was elected by Macedonian Defence Minister Buckovski on Thursday, the head of the ruling Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM) was elected at a extraordinary congressive congress.
The new SDSM leader will replace Hutfi Kostov, who resigned as prime minister last week.
Buckovski voted 391 votes in a second round after three candidates failed to win a slow majority.
Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska was second with 265 votes.
MP Tito Petkovski, who was competing for the letter, has won 144 votes in the first round.
"The new government is declared on December 7th or December 8th," Buckovski said in an interview with Free Europe / Radio Freedom (RFE / RL) on Sunday. "After December 15th, the new government believes it will be presented to parliament.
Buckovski has already started consultations with the SDSM coalition government, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), which ended the mandate.
LDP and DUI heads Risto Penov and Ali Ahmeti confirmed on Saturday that the SDSM will remain in the coalition, led by the SDSM after talks.
The two leaders also agreed that the coalition talks should not be more than a week, as the country expects the new government to be formed as prepared for the 2005 budget.
The VMRO-Macedonian leader Boris Stojmenov also discussed a possible alliance with the VMRO-Macedonian leader, "Buckovski said." However, the new government will not be a coalition for local elections. "
According to local media reports, only Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva is confident that the new cabinet will remain in office.
Sekerinska is not clear whether he will continue to help the prime minister.
The defence ministry is surprising about the media that the SDSM will accept this mandate to the LDP, while Buckovski is likely to take the rest of Society Minister Jovan Manasijevski, which ended the mandate.
Croatia is based on green energy investment
In Croatia, solar and beautiful energy sources are important, but they do not use the authority.

Team and wind, Croatia &aposs main renewable energy sources. [Reuters]
Croatia has a broad potential potential for renewable resources to expand renewable resources, but at least, it still does not use the potential authority for its solar, wind or geography resources.
However, this has changed in recent years.
"We are producing 40% of our power plants, which is now produced to renewable resources," said Environment Protection Minister Nikola Ruzinski.
As we have to buy about 30% of our energy, we are very poor, "he said.
The "new renewable" resources are interested in private investors, especially in the field of wind energy.
The first wind power plant in Croatia was established in 2004 on the island of Berg.
The company, on the Adria Wind Power, established 5950 square wind retail retail in the island &aposs Ravna region.
The biggest participation in the development of wind energy was held in the coastal area of Sibenik, especially in the two new plants of German Energy.
The first plant was held in 2006 in the Tratar-Krtolniqi reactions, and the first in the Orlice reaction last year.
While hundreds of regional purposes in Croatia have been removed, most of them are in the Dalmatia region, in the coastal coast.
The type of energy is a different picture, despite the broad potential.
According to data from the Hrvoje Pozar Energy Institute, about 15,000 square meters in Croatia are on the day, according to data from the Hrvoje Pozar Energy Institute.
The total production capacity of software is estimated to be estimated by about 52 square methods.
"There is no support for the benefit of solar energy in Croatia, and this job is removed," Vjeran Pirsic, head of the Eko Kahner Association, told SETimes.
The various energy clubs, including wind energy defendants, have blocked further development of the solar alternative, Pirsic said.
"Of course, all renewable energy has been given the wind wind power, and this is a very poor elections for our country, especially in the south," Pirsic said. "
Currently, the economy ministry has almost 700 applications for the development of renewable energy resources.
The completion of these will provide about 6,500 MW power production, but the current distribution system can only be able to deal with a part of this capacity.
Military energy infrastructure and tape bureaucracy is only one of the obstacles to the development of renewable energy resources in Croatia.
"The Union must get 60 different documents and allowing it to build a solar treasury on his own house," Pirsic told SETimes.
These include the idea of good product, "he said.
Despite these challenges, Economy Minister Djuro Popijac is optimistic.
"Currently, Croatia is currently spending 18 Terax hour electricity annually. More than 3.5 Teramet will be provided from energy renewable energy resources," Popijac said.
The future of Croatia is crucial for the EU, which is invested to invest in renewable energy.
For the bloc to meet energy requirements, the country has promised to meet at least 20% of the production and consumption energy needs by 2020.

"Those who expect possible reactions on the future of the president can be disappointed by the recent talks.
However, if you want to see all cards, we should not be exercised, "he said.
US officials have said their authority supports the idea of a single BiH president, but the Bosnian Serb entity, Republika Srpska (RS), the Bosnian Serb entity, opposes such a move.
"The president is not possible," said RS President Dragan Cavic, who supports the current tripartite presidency system.
A number of reconciliation solutions, including the only president of a different ethnic group, with two assistance from different ethnic groups, have also suggested.
However, RS representatives have continued their failure to change the presidential members in 16 months.
The main Croatian party -- leader of the Croatian Democratic League (HDZ), Dragan Covic, has been convinced from the tripartite presidency, with a route.
He is opposed to the Bosniak counterpart, Democratic Action Party (SDA) leader and current BiH presidency member Sulejman Tihic, who opposes the tripartite presidency.
There are disagreements about how the president or the presidency will be elected in the future.
Opposition parties, including the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Croatian People 'Union (HNZ), are being elected by the BiH Parliament.
However, the SDA stressed, along with possible aid, the president must choose voters.
Tihic told reporters that the president has made some progress on the authority and authority.
Participants agreed to represent the state president, the ambassadors' ambassadors and call for a special session of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Council of Ministers.
"It will be more difficult to reach an agreement on the reconstruction of the state assembly.
Therefore, the greatest talks have not started, "he warned.
Eight parties met in Washington in November, signed a joint declaration on constitutional reform until March 2006.
Currently, the central government has reached an agreement on a new constitution that would recognise the prime minister.
On Wednesday, the RS Parliament adopted a constitution that envisions the transfer of entity powers in the defence area to the state level.
The RS Defence Ministry and the Orthodox will be removed by January 1st and will open a single defence ministry and military commander in BiH.

All nuclear plants in the EU countries must be test, EU energy chief said on Tuesday (March 15th). [Reuters]
EU energy ministers, atom energy energy institutions and industry officials agreed on Tuesday (March 15th) that all nuclear reactors operating within the 27-nation bloc should be extended from detailed security control.
The decision was announced after EU Energy Commissioner Gunther Otinger was announced on Friday after an emergency meeting that monitored the 9.0 square earthquake and monopoly in Japan.
Since then, the Fukusama Daiichi nuclear plant, about 250km northeast of Tokyo, has taken a series of accommodations in a new disaster that the explosion in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in April 1986 has caused a new disaster.
Under the talks, the German commissioner said that the stakeholders can only be done in volunteer, but that most of the 14 member states, who are on the territory, will participate in the initiative.
Russia, Switzerland and Turkey will be invited to participate in the exercise.
"We want to organise a series of test, very comprehensive liberalisation," the Brussels Euobserver Internet news agency quoted Ottinger as saying on Tuesday. "We want to focus on our neighbours."
According to the European Network (ENS), 143 nuclear actors operating within the Union 'borders in January 2011, and 58% of them are in France, or 40% in France.

Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan responded on Monday (March 14th) to criticism that press freedom in Turkey are falling.
Erdogan accused the international media of creating "a card campaign" and urged journalists to analyse the incidents.
"There is no balance in this report," Erdogan said on a document criticised by the EU last week for criticising pressure on the media. "This report does not reflect media freedom in Turkey."
The controversy took place after seven journalists were arrested in their alleged alleged alleged involvement in the "Ergenekon" plan.
On Sunday, thousands of Turkish citizens protested the arrests, leaving Istanbul from the crowd Intelligence Street.
The demonstration was the lowest in the last period to support media freedom in Turkey.
"Several journalists have been arrested and some were arrested in prison for two years," said Golden Deldar Efe, a 40-year-old protest at the University of Information.
"They were sentenced to innocence," Irem Kayhan, 29, said in a demonstration. "We have a candidate for freedom of expression.
They argue democracy and speech. "
According to local media, 68 journalists have been arrested so far for allegedly linked to Ergenekon.
The government claims that only 27 journalists are in prison.
Most of the detainees criticised the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as clear.
In the past period, however, the arrest of two journalists, known for their stance against the 1980s military coup, and Nedim Sener, have shown many people.
Dudar Efe, who described him as a friendship, said the move was "very much for everyone here".
"You have accused Ahmet of being part of Ergenekon, and everyone are power."
Prosecutors said on Sunday that the arrest of Switzerland and Sener was not involved in the media.
However, the prosecution refused to announce that journalists were arrested.
The latest arrests have sparked some questions about whether freedom of expression in Turkey is falling.
Some journalists claim that the AKP has begun to take more cabinet efforts, since the elections were only three months ago.
Abdullah Gul, the founder of the Turkish president and AKP, has expressed his own concern over the arrests in the past weeks.
"I am impressed, that certain developments have not been taken to the public conscience are the case.
This is the level of Turkey and the image of everyone, which was achieved by everyone, "he said.

A court in Tirana decided on Monday (March 14th) that 13 people arrested in connection with allegations of illegal oil smuggling at the weekend.
The suspects are charged with allowing the two companies to sell high quality oil products at a time in mid-2009.
The suspects include businessmen, customs officers and tax officials.
The two major companies have been involved in the incidents, Euroil and Faji.
These companies have been operating in the market for years.
The size of the hospital is still unknown, as corruption has the effect of its own, vehicles and environmental effects.
If the accusations are true, however, Albania could be the biggest fugitive corruption in history.
According to local media, illegal activities have started in 2007 and continue until 2009.
The top indictees, oil businessmen Haji Elezaj and Ilyas Fugeku, are the son of the Martin Fishu.
The Albanian newspaper Moso reported on March 12th that the subsidiary of the unsuspended cafe was sold in the market for two years.
"This operation was conducted by the Euroil company, which is in co-operation with the shareholder and manager of the Fund Firi private firm, with shareholder and manager Haji Elezaj," the Albanian prosecution quoted Mapo as saying.
Customs officials are considering the documents and assist this corruption.
The profitable profit of corruption is paying millions of euros.
The former economy, trade and energy minister Dritan Prifti claimed that such activities were held last year.
Now Prifti says the investigation has been unfair.
Prifti claimed that three ministers were at least former ministerial ministers, as well as top state police officials and tax officials.
Prifti, however, is under a separate corruption investigation into allegations that 70,000 euros were bribed.
The former minister claims there is no crime.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha, the administration of Prime Minister Sali Berisha, says it is on the scene and corruption.
"The government will continue to continue an unsustainable fight against all those who are trying to harm any trafficking and damage the Albanian economy," Deputy Finance Minister Alfred Rohaj said.
Exhaj charged the opposition, saying the Socialists' unprecedented oil was made in the internal market without taxation for years.
"The newspapers who control the Petroleum are sent to the entity of Berisha," Edi Rama said on Sunday.
"On the other hand, they have allowed this genocide, and the witnesses of smuggling are in the government."
According to the Albanian representative of the International Transparency Organisation, some institutions in the country are not functioning.
The corruption should be discovered by the tax agency, customs or police, he said.

(BBC, The New York Times - 07 / 10 / 03; AP, AFP, Reuters, CNN, Anadolu Agency - 06 / 10 / 03)
The Turkish government decided on Monday (October 6th) on a positive decision to send troops to Iraq and applied to parliament to be given the authority to send troops.
Authorities expressed confidence that lawmakers could be able to decide on Tuesday.
Following a five-hour cabinet meeting Monday, Turkish Justice Minister and government spokesman Cemil Cicek said the decision to limit the mandate of soldiers to a year was signed by all ministers.
Cicek said the number of troops to Iraq has not been determined, saying it would be decided as a result of the need.
Earlier reports suggested that Turkey could send troops to 10,000.
The special issues, such as the army will be addressed, will be a negotiating market with the United States after parliamentary approval.
Sunday ’ s decision came as response to the US request for military aid to Iraq to improve peace and stability.
The move was welcomed by Washington.
"Turkey will play a major role in strengthening stability in Iraq," US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. "We continue talks with Turkish officials on the details of a possible troops that will be approved if the parliament approves the government 'request."

In Bulgaria, prosecutors have launched an investigation into several former ministers and state institutions managers for alleged involvement in corruption, architecture and other crimes.
The main opposition party, the leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party of Bulgaria, and former prime minister Sergey Stanishev, is the highest in investigation.
Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev demanded that the former prime minister from parliament on 3 November to remove the immunity of the former prime minister on 3 November, because Stanishev could launch an investigation into the disappearance of a secret report last year.
"Stanishev will investigate charges against documentary and materials, which include information on the state level, and the violation of the property of property, the state overall information," Velchev said in a statement.
The document was an internal software on the "actions of people and environmental actions", created by the State National Security Service DANS.
The scandal discovered Prime Minister Boyko Borisov last month, saying former DANS representative Alexey Petrov has surrendered him to the report.
According to rules related to the treatment of free documents, Stanishev had to surrender the document to a special department of the council, but Stanishev did not do so.
Petrov, an adviser to the former head of the DANS, has yet to win the internal software.
Earlier, the secret report was published in Internet.
The former prime minister, who claims the report has extradited the security service, rejected any charges, but said he would be voluntarily voluntarily from the immunity.
According to the Sofia city prosecutor Nikolay Kokinov, a close person, Stanishev, would be investigated as part of the case.
Borisov later told the media that the former prime minister did not extradite the total procedures for 11 secret documents, including smugglers and two documents related to the growing influence of Russia in the energy area.
The move against Stanishev was criticised by President Georgi Parvanov, who has been serving as head of the BSP.
Parvanov said the government had invited the former prime minister for a "loss", while the two world leaders have not done nothing to capture their leaders.

"How do you act with the leaders of the organised crime organisation that has become a symbolic of the transition process in Bulgaria?
"I am closed to a sharp share of the holidays that they are still immunity," he said.
The president reminded the criticism of Parvanov, Borisov reminded the number of reports that the criminal circumstances have stopped the state functioning are not 11, and asked him to intervene their work.
"We are monitoring the natural gas path: We will be able to catch the big bags, and then we will be able to drop the shopping.
We did not cover this work with the mafia restaurants, but also by the leaders of the former tripartite coalition led by the BSP, organised crime organisation.
How do not happen? "he said.
If Stanishev convicted, he could be sentenced to three years.
Borisov ’ s centre-right party won a swift victory in the July 5th parliamentary elections, due to EU aid to the European Development of Bulgaria (GERB), the country has now caused its commitment to fighting organised crime and corruption, which has now caused millions of euros.
Last four months, Borisov and ministries have revealed a number of suspects made by members of the Stanishev cabinet, and many of the suspects have prompted the prosecution office.
First, the reality that the public tender chances are violating, construction and renewal work, showing that the budget is the middle of millions of millions of millions of euros, with a contract on construction and gas methods.
Only three days after Velchev demanded the removal of the immunity of Stanishev from parliament for the investigation, the law on November 6th was demanded a similar request for former Labour Minister Emilia Maslarova.
The BSP member Maslarova will launch an investigation into the abuse of a social centre in Stara Zagora, a city of Stara and renovation contract.
The tender, worth about 10m euros, was given a company allegedly connected with the middle of the former ministry, and contract was signed as soon as possible before the end of the former ministry.
According to media reports, the renewal of 1,200 euros in the framework of the contract is even higher than the price of rebuilding the facility.
The Prosecutor said Maslarova would be charged with spending about 5m euros.
The former working minister rejected any accusations such as Stanishev, while prosecutors asked parliament to remove their immunity to do their jobs.

If it was proved, Maslarova could face sentences of prison and state officers by ten years.
In early September, the previous coalition government was the first member of the Hak and Freedoms Movement, former Agriculture Minister Valim Tsvetanov.
Tsvetanov has been charged with abuse of office in 15 supplies.
The Prosecutor also made similar charges against former director Stefan Yurukov, who allegedly committed a contract of about 2.3m euros from the state damage.
One of the first law movements of the government, Borisov has decided to postpone a decision to postpone the recent few sponsors of the country &aposs recent internal government to postpone a checkpoint contract, which allows the country to cope with public supplies in tourist areas.
The Sofia city prosecution charged another prominent official on November 9th.
Hristo Monov, executive director of the State Railways Company of the State Railways Company last month, was inaugurated on a 16.5m-euro agreement, which covers 30 second cagon.

Furthermore, Bulgaria has been transferred only 12 vagon so far, although it is paying 90 per cent of the contract.

Serbian government fall, early elections are expected
The Serbian government, which was formed less than ten months ago by the pro-Democracy parties, will be distributed due to deepening divisions on Kosovo and EU membership.
While the elections are expected to be held.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 10 / 03 / 08
"The citizens of Serbia deserve a better life and economic prospects that can only be possible in the EU," said President Boris Tadic. [Getty Images]
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica announced his own resignation at a press conference early Saturday (March 8th) and said his coalition partners had now lost their jobs due to different positions on Kosovo.
Therefore, the government asked the Democratic Party (DS) leader Boris Tadic on Monday to disburse the parliament and to call early elections on May 11th, when local and local elections will be held as a potential.
"A government that does not have a military policy has lost jobs -- this government is the end.
This means that our task should be extradited to the public, "he said.
The reason for the distribution of the coalition is unstable on Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia on February 17th, he added.
The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) has supported a controversial decision by the ultranationalist Radikal Party (DSS), which is prepared by the ultranationalist Radical Party, but if the Union promises Serbia to respect its sovereignty over Kosovo.
The partners, which advocates the fastest member of the ruling coalition as soon as possible, have rejected the DS and G17 Plus parties, which caused the government to fall.
Tadic said such a decision would be an obstacle to EU membership if Serbia cannot defend Kosovo.
He supports the early elections decision.
However, Tadic said the question of relations between coalition partners is in the EU.
"I believe the issue of the Serbian government does not have a joint stance on Serbia 'and people -- European and economic prospects.
The citizens of Serbia deserve a better life and economic prospects that can only be possible within the EU, and I am convinced that we will defend the best organisation against Kosovo independence, "he said.
Analysts say the early elections will be a referendum on the way Serbia will be monitored -- if pro-European parties won the EU, nationalist parties will be able to advance themselves.
The tackle is expected to be between Tadic 'DS and leaders, Vojislav Seselj, who are on trial at The Hague tribunal.
According to a survey published in February, the Radical Party will win 39%, DS and partners, with 38% of the vote.
According to these results, both parties will be able to form a government with the aid of coalition partners.
Therefore, if the elections are expected, the bloc, around 10% of Kostunica, will bring talks on building a new cabinet and uncertain.
People are celebrating Kosovo and the EU.
Polls say 67% of Serbs still want to join the EU.
However, 74% will not accept the acceleration of EU membership if Kosovo does not recognise its independence.
As the elections, both the economists and Kosovo Serbs are losing.
Economists believe Serbia will lose a large amount of foreign investment due to political instability, while Kosovo Serbs believe early elections will not help protect Kosovo and that political attractions are valued.

The Romanian study ministry announced in November and that 34,000 workers could lose their jobs by May 2009.
According to the government assessment, unemployment will be the worst private sector.
The head of the National Bank of Romania, the head of the country, said it is trying to reduce this estimated by only 0.5% of its power, but warned that estimates could be higher.
Political leaders argue the unemployment rate could reach 8% or about 1.2 million people, while the most affected sectors will be textile, construction, agriculture, automotiv and financial.
The figures are changing, according to the resources.
Ovijdiu Nicolescu, head of the Council for SMEs (SMEs) and Middle Employment Company, said that by October 30th, private companies in the province increased the number of jobs in the private sector to 150,000.
About 70,000 employees will be worked by mid-January, the Romanian Association of Information (ARCO) said in mid-November, noting that 35,000 others could lose their jobs as permanent as of April.
According to the ARCO, 32% of Romanian construction companies are affected by the crisis.
In addition, the Agrostar Federation asked the agriculture ministry to ratify nearly 75% of more than 50,000 employees -- as many agricultural companies do not continue production.
Several companies have announced that they would reduce production or send their activities.
Dacia, for instance, announced it would suspend its activities until December 30th, because sales dropped.
Romoil Petrochemicist, a part of the Roma oil Group, announced it would reduce production by 55% in December and January, while employees will increase 24%.
The output will reduce production by 20% and 40% after the 50% decrease in the Kimya factory, Btchim Ramnicu Valcea said.
More than 4,800 employees of the company will lose their jobs, the company announced.
Gbrbre factory Azometa ended the work of 250 employees due to the labour market.
The aircraft closed the 400-employee production unit in Romania Brasov, sparking some of the workers to Bulgaria, while Coj-Cola Iania and Oradea said they would close their units in Coj-Cola and Oradea.
Last week, President Traian Basescu visited the overall centres of firms in Dacia, Btomchim, Azometc, Ford, Daewoo, Nokia and Arcelitorory Mittal, and assured that none of the public will not be bankruptcy.
The government, meanwhile, adopted several measures that will help the economy, including the removal of the first year of license tax in new car, and the removal of 1,000 euros, which has created new jobs.

European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Thursday (May 22nd) that participation in other sides that defuse nuclear energy could benefit the EU in the fight against climate change.
"The Nationalist energy could contribute to this fight," the EC chief said at the beginning of the European Non-Energy Forum.
The 27-nation bloc, which is increasingly worried without the global global warming, aims to reduce at least 20% in the 1990s levels by 2020.
Supporters of the protocol energy insist that this energy will help achieve this target because of the less widespread use of carbondic production.
The growing dependence on oil prices and EU countries' hydrobon imports has caused calls for diversifying the bloc 'energy sources.
Barroso stressed on Thursday that nuclear energy is not only a low carbon energy source, but also at the same time, the price hikes are less damage to prices.
"The NPP is helping improve the security of the EU 'energy resources and reduce our dependence on energy sources," EC chief Czech and Slovak prime ministers Modk Topek and Robert Fico said at the conference, as well as EU environmental energy officials.
The EU, which has 15 countries with nuclear power now, has been split on the issue.
Germany, Austria and Austria are one of the most nuclear anti-EU countries, which closed their actors after the Cernol pharmaceutical factory in April 1986.
The Czech Caspian Church also warned that "there is no more time".
The Slovenian prime minister seems very important for nuclear energy in terms of European energy security.
"We do not have the energy security in Europe without the Non-energy energy," Fico said on Thursday.
Before joining the EU, Slovakia agreed to close the two retail actors from the Soviet era by 2009.
This "irresponsible decision" will have to "to import 20% of the electricity that needs Slovakia", Fico said.
The only solution is a "new agreement" with the EU.
Before joining the bloc, Latvia and Bulgaria are urging the EU to consider similar commitments.
Bulgaria has six active nuclear actors, but four of them closed.
Former energy exports are now planning to build a new nuclear power plant in the northeastern Sofia.

Only a few days after protesters claiming that an international piracy agreement violates human rights, Bulgaria withdrew its support for an agreement.
The agreement, which aims to establish an international legal framework for the Trade Regulations Agreement (ACTA), aims to create an international legal framework on stage products, narcotics and Internet branches, was signed only 1 months after the parliament, which aims to establish an international legal framework.
The proposal sparked massive protests in Europe, including Greece, Bulgaria, Britain, Italy and France on February 11th.
Bulgarian officials said they would wait for a clear position on the agreement before progress.
"I am very optimistic when there is no market vehicles that have not been dealing with the diversity, but also with sanctions," Bloomberg quoted Economy and Energy Minister Trajko Trajkov as telling reporters in Sofia.
"Youth are not on human rights," he said.
The agreement was signed on January 26th in Tokyo, including Greece and Bulgaria.
While some countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland have not taken steps to ratify, Germany, Slovakia and Estonia were among the countries that have not signed the agreement.
The ACTA must be approved by the European Parliament on March 10th 2010, claiming that "respect for basic rights such as freedom of expression and the right to secret confidence", claiming that talks should be approved by the European Parliament, which signed a decision on transparency.
The increase will be held in June.
The protesters in Bulgaria complain that the ACTA has been signed without debate in public opinion or without consulting civil society groups.
Under the ACTA, the owners of the bidder will have to announce personal databases without functioning functioning (ISP).
Observers also congratulated authorities of participating in an international agreement "that could lead to basic civilian rights and freedom", which could lead to violations of the violations of the piracy.
"The main problems of the ACTA are very extent, the mechanisms will allow citizens to use fundamental and freedom of rights," Stanislav Dodov, who organised the protest in Sofia, told SETimes.
"The removal of the ACTA is very important," Angels Samuridis, who is responsible for telecommunications with the new Greek Corps Party, told SETimes.
"The fact that it is a beautiful point to the scrutiny of different products has come to a point that will cover digital materials, and the World Trade Organisation should be prepared with a clear base in all countries," Samuridis said.
"The agreement is opposed to authorities" that a restaurant or website should be closed, and it would allow them to enable any personal database, "said Portugal guests Aleksander Georgiev.
Meanwhile, Romanian film distributors have also been repeatedly on internet fear.
Oana Stoin-Omer, the deputy director of the Romanian film distribution company and the Motion Picture Company, told SETimes. "We expect a movie to demonstrate more than 2 weeks after the official demonstration in the United States."
Vekildjan Pambuccian, head of the Romanian parliament &ap91; Assembly] Assembly, warned that ACTA has created questions about the practice of some of the materials in the bridge.
"Refugee has a problem, piracy is not direct.
And we have made an extraordinary practice to deal with these problems, we have offered the absence to the abuse, "he said.
"I recommend that the movie companies will go on the way of software production.
The illegal software has declined, while the tenijinal software procurement rate has increased.
He also criticised that the fight against postponement has been affected, "Pambuccian said, noting that the ACTA Romanian government has not been discussed before it was signed by the Romanian government.

Political parties in Serbia resume talks on whether the new government will be formed after the parliamentary elections earlier this month, Belgrade economists say the coalition, located at the pro-European Democratic Party (DS), led by Serbian President Boris Tadic, is more likely to gain the security of foreign investors.
Economists also say that a DS government with the inflation issue is under way and will protect the country &aposs economic abuse.
The government is based on the coalition of the Socialist Party of Serbia, which won 20 seats in the 11 May elections.
The Socialists began talks with the Radical Radicals and the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), but the plans were dropped.
Some leaders in the Socialist coalition are now seeking talks with the DSS and start talks with the DS.
DSS and Radicals claim that Serbia would be able to declare the agreement, claiming that Kosovo would recognise its independence through the SAA through February 17th.
Belgrade economist Sasa Cogocic told Southeast European Times that if the Serbian Radical Party and the Socialist coalition form a new government, foreign investors will be cautious until Belgrade has made its relations with the EU.
However, if the DS and Socialists are in the ruling, the DS and the Socialists have been "returned to their policies and they will not restore investors" for their future ", Cogovic said.
Economist Jurij Bajec said Serbia "needs a government that will provide a direct foreign investment to ensure a 7% GDP growth in the next year".
"For something like this, foreign investment external investment expansion of 3 billion euros annually and a total of 2 billion euros," Bajec said.
The external foreign direct investment of this car can only be achieved with a pro-European government, "the EU said, which is" the economic partner of Serbia ".
"A pro-European government to implement European standards will guarantee security and stability for investors from all world, including Russia, China and India," Bajec said.
Some, however, are different.
Economist Jovan Dusanic said foreign interests have invested in Serbia by more privatisation, and the green investments in the green light.
The new government will not be difficult to attract investments through the sale of major assets such as the oil industry and power utility, the Belgrade daily Dusanic said in a special statement.
The economist Russia and China use them, saying it is important that the country has submitted the conditions such as investors, not what it is in power, or the country is in the international process.
Do Serbia Will Legal Charter?
The Serbian Orthodox Church, which has a major security of the public, has proposed the restoration of the monarchy in Serbia.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 11 / 12 / 03
In less than a month before the Serbian parliamentary elections, Patriarch Pavle proposed the restoration of the Patriarch.
The head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Veliaht Aleksandar Karacorcevic, called on the issue to take more effective.
He noted that all galleries have shown the stage of history of Serbia, and the country seems to see a "unbelieved challenge" as the republic.
Serbia was first gold in the 13th century.
The communists, however, are 2.
Following the victory in World War II, the monarchy was transferred in 1945. In 1947, Karacorcevic was released from the country &aposs property.
The move was allowed to return to home by former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, despite opposition to the regime. In 2001, some of its property were extradited.
Public polls show that 7 per cent and 15 per cent support the return of the monarchy.
However, when the Serbian Orthodox Church has a strong influence on public opinion, this support is expected to further increase after the call for the explosion.
The return of the monarchy is "a rights and justice issue", Karacorcevic said, adding that this would be the interest of the nationality.
Veliaht believes the monarchy should be formed with the public referendum, but also with the Serbian law enforcement bodies.
"Technical, stability, unity and process," he said, arguing the establishment of a similar constitutional architecture in many EU countries.
Following the three presidential elections, he believes Serbia needs a search for institutional stability.
However, the adoption of the monarchy is also a large number of major Serbian parties -- the Democratic Party of Serbia, the Serbian Radical Party, Democratic Party and G17 Plus.
The Democratic Party and the G17 Plus' opposition to the amendment of a state arrangement in the law, which also discussed the republic.
As the Democratic Party of Serbia and Radicals, Vojislav Kostunica and Tomislav Nikolic, the Serbian presidential authorities have popular leaders that will not be easy by the Serbian presidency.
Kostunica said the monarchy was not one of Serbia 'priorities and that it could be resolved through the referendum.
Montenegrin officials have made a negative impact on the removal of the monarchy in Serbia.
Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic said that if this is, Serbia-Montenegro is not possible.
He believes that a republic in a "monarchy" is impossible to function within a single state ".

The agreement, which Serbia signed as independent, is the first practice of a double approach to Serbia-Montenegro, which was approved by the EU last year and has been approved by the EU last year, allowing Brussels to monitor separate economic development routes, while Brussels is on track to join the Union.
According to Parivodic, the textile industrial industrial industry in Serbia has around 7 per cent of the republics' GDP, while Serbian textile products are exported to EU countries.
First, the EU has implemented a certain boycott of textile products from Serbia, but only 25 per cent of the property exported from the regime were closed.
Under the new agreement, 75 per cent of the remaining 75 per cent can be exported without customs obstacles.
"This is a good message and a third of this market is to compete in equal conditions with neighbouring countries," he said.
We do not compete with Pakhstan, India or China, but we can compete in the food sector -- this is our ambitious products.
At this point, I see that the agreement has created a chance of an agreement, when I hope we will have our textile industry. "
Under co-operation with the EU, the textile industry is estimated that Serbia &aposs textile industry could reach the level of exports and third individuals from 1991.
To achieve this, Serbian textile producers must find serious partners and continue former business relations.
How every factory will be the best way to buy the agreement, and every factory has stopped its own administration.
Many economists believe that Serbia has the potential to attract significant foreign investors in the textile sector, as the production is lower than Western Europe and Eastern Europe.
At the same time, employees in the textile sector are expected to increase living standards.
About 100,000 people are working in Serbia &aposs textile industry, which means that some 300,000 people will be able to learn from the sector.

Kosovo institutions have more responsibility, but KFOR is determined to ensure a safe environment.
General Markus told SETimes that early steps will not be taken.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 19 / 03 / 10
KFOR Commander General Markus Bentler said the security situation in Kosovo is hiding and stable. [KFOR]
In Kosovo, about 9,800 NATO soldiers, including the 25-nation Alliance and seven Alliance countries, have been united under KFOR.
They won the census of the local population and fear it.
German Lieutenant General Markus Bentler insists that KFOR will continue "to ensure the safety of all Kosovo citizens in co-operation with local authorities and international organisations".
In an exclusive interview with SETimes, Bentler assessed how KFOR will work to achieve this goal.
SETimes: NATO has sold the number of soldiers in Kosovo to some 10,000.
Is it enough?
Lieutenant General Markus Bentler: KFOR is now accepting the security situation in Kosovo and stable.
A trend of the number of military warnings is a sign of confidence.
In order to respond to any threat to the confidence and security climate, KFOR has regular exercise exercises in all parts of Kosovo.
The military will not take any early or permanent step in the draft process, and will not be easy for security in Kosovo.
SETimes: How do you relations with the Kosovo Security Force?
How do you recognise the mission?
Bentler: The Kosovo Security Force (KSF) is the organisation of a multiethnic and couple of couple aid.
The extraordinary response will provide explosive ammunition of explosive ammunition and skills in civilian defence.
The KSF proved the growing authority of a civilian defence and humanitarian aid organisation in Albania.
Representatives of the ethnic minority communities have a clear factor of participating in this multiethnic force.
SETimes: We have suspended co-operation with the KSF.
Nevertheless?
Bentler: [KFOR] stopped the support of the KSF on March 6th as interim, advisory and education activities. [A week] action was made in response to a KSF Armed, a KSF honour on 6 March.
The situation shows that the KSF is not military status.
The fourth NATO flag was also attracted.
KFOR is not acceptable because it is unilateral status.
SETimes: How do you see the relationship?
Bentler: After KFOR suspended support for the Kosovo Security Force, the president and the prime minister worked with [KFOR commander] to resolve the problems.
The new agreement contains the use of military weapons that the Kosovo Security Force is reached by an agreement.
The Kosovo Security Force will not have a defence or military role, because this task is a family to KFOR.
We continue on March 10th.
SETimes: Some Serbian monuments that have a historic period are still protected by KFOR.
How can Kosovo take over this job?
They: Local institutions are preparing to take more responsibility.
A key element of KFOR 'mandate is to strengthen security tasks in accordance with their ability to prove local security institutions.
While protecting religious and cultural monuments in Kosovo as valuable goods, all Kosovo people are responsibility for the protection of them, KFOR is part of the responsibility for a safe and secure environment.
Kosovo Police (KP) is prepared to take over police duties imposed by KFOR earlier.
KFOR has managed to co-ordinate the important aspects of its mandate with institutions in Kosovo and enable the KP with EULEX.
EULEX is responsible for monitoring the KP and to advise the advisory and recommendations.
We see Kosovo Police to fulfil many tasks and willingness.
If the KP will be able to provide security in the last municipal elections, it could be said to have a good job.
KFOR continues to organise all agencies, including the KP, EULEX and the ministries of ministries.
SETimes: What is Serbia a military threat to Kosovo?
Bentler: KFOR does not see any foreign threat to Kosovo.
KFOR [EUL] is limited with the Kosovo Executive Administration. [EUL] and we are committed to ensuring a safe and safe environment in the completion of Kosovo, as well as the 1244 UN Security Council warns that KFOR enables the same security climate.
We are unfortunately and we are not involved in political issues as long as they do not threaten a safe and secure environment, and we do not comment on this issue.
SETimes: How does Belgrade supported parallel structures in the north threaten general security?
Bentler: The presence of the parallel structures is a political issue.
As part of the mandate, KFOR has envisioned stable security requirements that the shares of political problems could be resolved and resolved.
[or] are not valuable.
Still, the consequences could lead to unstable results, and even the effects of both structures.
For example, a single judicial system is not the current, but there is no legal security or climate on domestic issues.
The so-called "parallel structures" could be a political abuse, as well as a safe and secure partner of the political message on the issue, and therefore KFOR cannot be tolerated.
Therefore, KFOR is monitoring the situation in the areas where it is operating in order to respond to any threat to the security and security climate.
KFOR is close to all international and local shares, and its mandate supports the political solution as part of its mandate.
If there is a threat to the security and security climate in Kosovo, KFOR will be ready to take active measures against this threat.
SETimes: How do you control the Serbian border in the north?
Bentler: KFOR, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, has very good technical co-operation with neighbouring countries, including Montenegro, as well as on the administrative border line with Serbia.
We have a technical level of meetings with Serbia.
We control [KFOR and KP] and our union (KFOR / Serbian Together).
The control of people and goods of goods is the mandate of police and does not exist KFOR.
Among the players about how these tasks will be fulfilled during the administrative arrangement.
KFOR will only intervene when the people of Kosovo are in danger.
SETimes: Most of the people of Kosovo are more confidence in any local institutions.
Nevertheless, soldiers from countries that do not recognise Kosovo as a state.
What is this problem?
Bentler: [Tanim] does not affect KFOR 'mandate or its position on Kosovo' status.
I believe that KFOR is not only as a safe Alliance of the local population, but only a homojen unit.
KFOR soldiers have always linked the organisation 'unilateral stance.
SETimes: Kosovo has made it clear to its Euro-Atlantic integration bid.
How do you see the possibility of the integration of Kosovo in Euro-Atlantic structures?
Bentler: KFOR has not played an active role in resolving the status issue.
The organisation has avoided any debate on political issues.
SETimes: How do you see the chances of Kosovo as general?
Bentler: I am very optimistic.
In the past decade, we have achieved many things, especially in security.
This is a precondition for progress in other areas, including economic and political development.
KFOR continues to provide support, putting the remaining issues a valuable solution to a peaceful solution.
According to the EC, EU member states show little progress on education targets
Nearly one of the five targets that the EU wants to meet in education by 2010.
The progress on the other four goals is in the central level, the European Commission said in a report earlier.
By Svetla Dimitrova for Southeast European Times in Sofia -- 28 / 01 / 08
Only 1.3 per cent of the population in Romania participates in education and education. [AFP]
According to the European Commission (EC) progress report in November, EU member states must do more to meet all five education targets that have reached an agreement on 2002.
At the same time, Brussels noted that other goals continue to be a serious issue in terms of education and education systems in Europe.
In a meeting in Lisbon on March 2000, EU leaders agreed on the bloc "to become the most competitive and dynamic economy based on the world".
As part of this goal, joint targets for improving education and education systems in Europe in 2002 have been set.
Among the five targets, the decrease of the school is reduced to 10 per cent, reducing the number of writer students at least 20 per cent, and at least 85 per cent of young people are providing education.
Other two targets are the need for a climate to improve the number of higher students in the field of Maxitime, Fen and Technology (MFT), and reducing the decrease of gender discrimination and the education process of 12.5 per cent of the population.
In a annual report on the Lisbon education targets, which the EC is widely prepared to statistics in 2005, the Union has said it could only meet its targets for the MFT.
"If the current trend is continued, the number of disabled in the EU in 2010 will be spent from 850,000 students -- 850,000 students -- the number of unions in mafia, pen and technology -- from 2005," the EC report said.
The countries that have shown the best performance in the 20-29 category of MFT per cent per cent of the number of performances, Ireland (24.5), France (22.5) and Lithuania (18.9), while Slovakia, Portugal and Italy were the most powerful growth rates to change between 70 per cent and 100 per cent.
At the same time, however, the report said that there are many progress in the reduction of gender discrimination between the MFT irregularities and the rate of 30.8 per cent in 2000 has reached 31.2 per cent, compared to 2005.
The countries, which showed the best performance in terms of gender distribution, were Estonia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, where more than 40 per cent of the MFT manipulation.
The country is the highest in 2005, with 46.9 per cent of the EU candidate Macedonia.
There is no gender equality in education, according to the report. [EU]
However, the EC says, if there is no more progress in four areas, the new generation will face the risk of except from the society, which would lead to serious negative consequences for both the economy and the society. "
A 2.3 per cent decrease has been dropped in the number of students who have been living in the early school since 2000.
However, the share of the EU average of 15.3 per cent in 2006, the situation has also shown that more efforts should be made to ensure that the number of students from the school by the end of 2010 should not be able to exceed 10 per cent.
"The goal of Europe is to encourage young people to education or teachers after the difficult education process, and at least to get education.
At least at least, a education success is seen as the minimum of active participation in the economy based on the information, "he said.
Slovenia (5.2 per cent), the Czech Republic (5.5 per cent), Poland (5.6 per cent), Slovakia (6.4 per cent), Finland (8.3 per cent), Austria (9.6 per cent) and the EU member Norway (5.9 per cent) are the best performance of Croatia to join the EU by 2010.
Malta and Portugal were the worst performance of the bloc, with 41.7 per cent and 39.2 per cent, respectively.
No progress has been made in order to boost low students' author.
The number of successful students increased from 19.4 per cent in 2000 to 19.8 per cent in 2003.
The situation shows that many EU countries must be more difficult to ensure that they can include a 15.5 per cent part of the group in 15 years by 2010. According to statistics, Finnish (5.7 per cent) and Ireland (11 per cent), which showed the best performance in this area.
"The winning of Temel skills is the first step in the information community.
However, 1 million students from the EU have shown low success for the author, "he said.
The number of MFT irregularities increased by 25 per cent in 2000. [Getty Images]
According to the EC report, at least 85 per cent of the 22 groups from the EU have not made enough progress to complete education by 2010.
"The rate of those who have completed the education of the EU is around 80 per cent and this rate has been very low since 2000," the commission said.
The Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia will be the best performance of this figure, while members of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Spain were Portugal, Malta and Spain.
In 2002, EU countries decided that 12.5 per cent of the population, which is 25-64, has decided to be part of the education process, and that target was very important for the participation of the Union, competitiveness and economic prosperity and the people 'participation in the society, the task and personal exercise.
Denmark, Britain and Finland are among other member states in terms of this target.
In these countries last year, the rate of participants in the education and education and education process was 9.6 per cent, compared to the EU average of 9.6 per cent and 23.1 per cent, respectively.
The worst performance of the bloc is Bulgaria and Romania, while members of the bloc, which were 1.3 per cent and Greece, were less than 1.9 per cent.
"It is important that Europe is a information society and is the highest quality and education and education in order to compete in the world economy," EU Education, Culture and Youth Commissioner Jan Fiev said.
However, this report shows that EU member states must do more than two times to fulfil the requirements of the 21st century system in order to fulfil the requirements of education and education.
The message of policy structures of all countries is clear: we need to invest more effective in the human capital, "he said.

"They were arrested in December 1989 to tackle their names," Mircea Dinescu, a member of the National Council for Information (CNSAS), told reporters.
Ahead of the new Romanian explosion that will replace Teoctir on July 30th, the council announced plans to reveal all high-ranking businessmen who have co-operated with former secret police.
"One of them will be the Orthodox Church, and then it will be an exploration to reveal that it is a Securitate general," Antonescu said on August 9th.
On Tuesday, a member of the council confirmed that the Banat Metropolitan Church and a member of the Church of the Church, Nicolae Corneanu and a member of the Constantin Balace-Stolnyci election school, a member of the new explosion and the new explosion, had co-operated with secret police.

He made even a letter that was sent to the communist dictator of Romania, Nikolay Ceausku, who asked him to extradite him to the victims.
Plamadea died in 2005.
The AP reported on Tuesday that at least 700,000 people were believed to be working as a conservative to the Securitate.
Earlier this month, a local NGO called on members of the high-ranking paramilitary classic classes with the Securitate to nominate an explosive post in a country where the Orthodox Church is still seen as the most safe institution.
The candidates for the post will be elected by the 52 members of the Constitutional Church.

The EU must start talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on the country, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said on Tuesday (May 3rd), marking progress in the post-conflict conflict.
"The European Commission (EC) will be in place to start negotiations," the German leader said after a meeting with BiH Prime Minister Adnan Terzic in Sarajevo.
He also met with BiH presidency members, High Representative Paddy Ashdown and EUFOR Commander David Leakey.
A EC delegation will arrive in BiH on 19 May to review the progress BiH has made in fulfilling the 16 requirements under the feasibility study on its own.
A positive assessment will likely allow the EU to launch SAA talks as the first step towards eventual membership next month.
BiH is the only Balkan country that has not been able to get a green light on its path to EU membership.
While noting that BiH has achieved success in judicial and administrative reform over the past two years, Schroeder praised the country for positive steps in police reform, one of the key requirements set by the EU.
Last week, leaders of the 11 parties in parliament reached an important agreement on the principles of restructuring in the BiH police, and parties are expected to complete talks on the EC working group before it comes to the country.
He also praised another key condition for recent efforts to fulfil co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
"There are more jobs to be done," he said.
Since January, nine Bosnian Serb war crimes indictees have surrendered the ICTY.
However, the two most wanted indictees -- wartime Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military commander Ratko Mladic -- remain at large.
German Deutsche Welle interpreted that BiH 'entry into the EU would not be impossible if Karadzic and Mladic are not brought to justice.
"It is important to be a long process of partnership with Europe, as well as that it is impossible and that it is the only way to do," Schroeder said on Tuesday.
He also offered experts from Germany to Germany to prepare the new constitution and prepare for the economic reform of BiH.
Welcoming Schroeder 'strong support for BiH' EU bid, Terzic promised that his country would make an active effort to achieve its leader in the Balkans to ensure security.
"This is the most powerful support and an extraordinary motivation for the remaining reforms," Reuters quoted Terzic as saying.
Following in Serbia, Swiss Future in Kosovo
Belgrade and Pristina have increased vival for talks on Kosovo &aposs final status, which is expected to be held in the coming months, while Serbian politicians discussed the consensus.

While talks on the final status of Kosovo have won, Serbian politicians have expressed different views on the province 'future.
International Commission member of the Balkans and former Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic recently said the commission "envisions free security for Serbian and other minority rights", adding that Kosovo would be the best for the entire region.
However, Svilanovic, the other political figures and media in Serbia, which continues to be controversial controversy of independence, has been deepened by the media.
Serbian President Boris Tadic has no return to the Serbian administration in Kosovo, but said Belgrade would continue to oppose a slight independence.
"This will lead to instability in the region," Tadic said, citing neighbours.
Currently, a fixed debate is under way.
According to Aleksandar Mitic, a professor of political scientists at the University of Belgrade, however, Serbian leaders are willing to repeat "independence", instead of creating a clear platform, or to submit their positions to support their positions.
According to Kosovo Albanian political leader Veton Syoi, a similar situation in Pristina is the only difference.
"Our negotiation platform is not many of the parliament -- but independence, and independence with independence.
But both sides agree on some issues, despite their consensus on independence.
For example, the current status quo will not be more protected and is a critical issue of minority rights.
Furthermore, Serbs and Kosovo Albanians are unique for the future in the EU.
In a recent interview with Kosovo television channel, UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said talks on Kosovo 'final status will begin at the end of September or early October, and Kosovo Albanian representatives believe they will be ready for talks with Serbian counterparts and the international community.
The foundation of the consequences will be the basis of three flights -- not returning to the pre-March 1999 situation, the division of Kosovo and should not be united with a neighbouring territory.
"Currently, Belgrade and Pristina will be the most important and most effective participants.
However, nobody expects Belgrade and Pristina to agree on their own.
The international presence is necessary in the talks.
This presence is still discussed, but the final decision is still the responsibility of the BiH Security Council.
The Council will approve a decision to recognise Kosovo &aposs final status. "

The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) will be ready to present a new "civilian constitution", which was considered two years after the 1980s military coup, and will be ready to submit the end of this year.

The defendants include Orhan Pamuk, the winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Literature, and the prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink, who was killed earlier this year.
According to the daily Zaman, the AKP plans to propose the proposed constitution, the international agreement and consortiatives signed by Turkey will ensure that the country will overcome its laws.

The Kosovo government has invited EULEX to launch talks on the establishment of a broad task force that will fight organised crime and political corruption.
The offer was confirmed on Thursday (February 11th) by EULEX spokesman Karin Limdal.
The same day, the Kosovo daily Koha Ditore reported that the idea was discussed at the meeting of EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon and Deputy Prime Minister Hajrein Kuwait.
The task will include local and foreign prosecutors, as well as various police officers.
"I believe the group will be formed soon," he said. "I will support the parasal and physical support."
The delegation seems to be seen as a response to the latest meeting of the International Convention Group (ISG), which has asked to make progress in fighting such high-level crimes in Kosovo.
The ISG said in a report issued after the February 8th meeting in Vienna that "Kosovo needs more progress in fighting corruption, including corruption, organised crime in northern Kosovo [and] to establish the Law".
Laura Pula, a Kosovo prosecutor at the District Court in Pristina, says it is "more important", saying it is very important, saying it is full support.
"There is no way, there is [in other] countries in the region.
"The security of the security should be improved for people who will be part of it," he said. "It will need more protection to protect those who are very sensitive cases."
Only the number of prosecutors are not increasing, Pula said, but the persons in the task force should be forecast to private areas such as corruption, drug or human trafficking.
The prosecutor also warned that if the prosecutors and details working on certain cases are not protected, their lives will be dangerous.
"It should not be known that the prosecution is working in the case," Pula said.
The group "Civil Society" in Kosovo supports the force and final success.
"We see corruption and organised crime as the main threats to Kosovo," the group said on February 9th.
"These are blocking our country 'institutions and overall society, blocking economic spending and imposing the fragile democracy of Kosovo. [We] damage our European future," he said.

Kiro Gligorov, the first president of Independent Macedonia, dismissed many people in the first day of the new year.
However, a debate on his role in Macedonia has started.
Gligorov was given without the state ceremony on his own request, and the government &aposs central leader declared a one-day tour on January 3rd.
"Gligorov said at a ceremony in parliament that [Gligorov] is the only thing that is known by everyone," President Gjorge Ivanov said at a ceremony in parliament.
However, Gligorov told the Greek media in 1984 that Macedonians have come to the Balkans in the 6th century, and said the Greeks had no connection with the Greeks, saying he was not linked to the Greeks and no connection with the supervision.
"There are a cancer of the Roma Gligorov, while all Yugoslav people have the same Slavic rocks over 50 years," historian Violeta Achkovska told SETimes. "Gligorov is based on this unfortunate and unsolved basis for the Macedonian language Slavoslav broadcast."
"Even if the last minute, Bosnian President Izetbegovic had even offered a federation, trying to rescue Yugoslavia," Achkovska added.
During Gligorov 'presidency between 1991-1999, Macedonia became a UN member under the "provisional" referendum "of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and acknowledged the 1995 Interim Agreement with Greece and a controversial economic transition.
"We have shown the foundations of the Macedonian state," former Parliament Speaker Stojan Andov told SETimes. "They showed how the Macedonian state will manage and Gligorov will be sceptical."
In October 1995, Gligorov was elected from a assassination initiative in central Skopje.
Police are still unable to reveal that the attack had no one or that nobody has done.
"I believe that I believe that the internal structures, such as Gligorov 'close working colleagues, are still at large.
Even a single interior minister, including the most applied application, Ljubomir Frchovski, discovered the truth and failed to end the issue.
This case should not be resolved, "he said.
Jordan Nikolov, 49-year-old Jordan Nikolov, is convincing the public with the massacre of the communist state after the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia.
"Gligorov and his team would be difficult to stop Macedonia from the dramatically Yugoslavia, even if the time Prime Minister Nikola Kjusev was not.
"Macedonia is the only republic that declared a peaceful way of independence," Gligorov said. "Macedonia is the only republic that declared a peacefully declaration of independence."

Serbs and other ethnic minorities could play a decisive role in the new Kosovo parliament, which took place on Monday (February 21st).

Regional Education Minister Enver Hoxhaj told Klan on Monday that one would be four prime ministers, one of the Serb community.
"Kosovo Serbs have created a powerful votes in the Kosovo parliament, because they won, and they will have the seats who won," analyst Krenar Gashi told SETimes.
Thaci, who serves as a new cabinet mandate, will head a ruling coalition that does not have a sovereignty.
The Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), which won 34 seats in general elections, has reached an agreement with the Alliance for a new Kosovo (AKR), with businessman Behgjet Pacolli (AKR).
The AKR has made its participation in the requirement of Pacolli to become president, and the PDK had to accept this request.
The new Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, the Independent Liberal Party, Ibrahim Rugova List and minority lawmakers, also signed agreements.
The new coalition will be a strategic opposition from the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and the third largest group in parliament, the nationalist Vetevendosje movement.
The LDK has now sought to represent the new coalition of Kosovo.
The new government will be "a political minority party -- or even worse, a ethnic minority government", the media reported.
He could face a public opinion that continues to deal with the overall political arrangement of Kosovo -- corruption and other institutional problems.
On Monday, a local NGO, known as the IL Movement, protest in front of the local parliament building.
The demonstrators called on parliament to elect a president, which will represent the people, as well as represent all of everyone "clearly".
The demonstrators have extradited the lawmakers who have been investigating and doubt of the judges, citing the husband and from abroad.

The country has already won 11 gold medals in 2000, with four years ago. In 2000, Romanian athletes won 11 gold medals and ranked 11th in the country.
Apart from gymnastics, however, the Olympic team faces the problem of this year.

"Romanians have won eight, even 16 years ago, and even a generation of the Olympic medal," sports writer Lauthor Lauornei said. "In the 1989 period, Soviet Authorities were trained in a system in accordance with EU standards.
Currently, athletes are preferred to the individual anchestra, including some abroad, and there is no enough resources to get another system. "
Kriz is particularly serving in the number of athletes, such as the basketball, voluntary, water, water, routes, basketball, basketball.
"The reason that these teams do not give Athens remarks, the reason that many athletes abroad have not been able to take part in the long-standing interior period with the national team.

First property owners expect extradition
Serbia is preparing to extradite the property of the state, which was placed ahead of 1945.
Some, however, fear that the process would jeopardise its macroeconomic stability.

The former Serbian government, led by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, issued a draft law on a few days before the new ruling coalition reached an agreement on a new ruling coalition.
The bill is not expected to obtain the Democratic Party of President Boris Tadic, because it is positive assessments from NGOs who advocate property.
According to the new law, the real owners of goods will be able to cover the former goods or receive a compensation.
Serbian citizens gave about 73,000 languages for the extradition of Montenegrin swimming square and other goods.
The bill calls for the creation of development resources that must "leave" from the facilities built on agricultural areas before extraditing former owners.
Commercial buildings, agencies, industrial and retail facilities and other private retail clubs will be subjected.
Public transportation property are not extradited to the 1945 pre-priority situation, but former owners will receive compensation.
According to the draft bill, about 4 billion euros for the property minimum.
"The funds will not affect the macroeconomic stability of Serbia, because it will meet with 4.5% rates from January 1st to 2028," former Finance Minister Milan Paridovic said.
They will be used to buy state shares, paying tax payment or use the loans of state banks.
Mile Antic, head of the Belgrade Public Administration Network, believes the bill has been proposed so far, and believes that the state will reduce the minimum minimum, if the main owners of the property will have to pay.
"When the countries are extradited, the budget will increase tax revenues and will be much lower than 4m euros," Antic said.
Former head of the State Privatisation Agency, Avukat Pavlovic, says the draft is not equal to all key goods.
"The bill is not equal to the former owners who have been forced to replace the orijinal goods and forced to receive a minimum," Pavlovic said.
According to Paridovic, however, the draft law aims to protect all citizens, instead of individual citizens.
"The bill does not work to protect the absolute interests of former property owners, but the law must protect the macroeconomic policy.
In addition, residents should protect their interests and make it efficient, "he said.
The first task of the new Serbian government was to ratify the 2007 budget and end the legal transition period.
The bill is likely to meet the Parliament agenda this summer, and the real owners who want to end the historic isolation of Serbia, such as other countries in the region, are water.
The cost of goods that have been protected by private property is one of the key conditions Serbia must fulfil on its path to European integration.

Observers, Hula, 11, dead, showed that the first test of the death was H5N1.
The fourth broadcast card, which has been served as a wealthy insurance, reportedly has improved.

Croatian Justice Minister Vesna-Scare Ozbast: Croatia must be given a compensation if EU prospects.
Croatia is taking steps to resolve the problem of a compensation from Ustase and the communist regime, which has been discovered by the communist regime and to resolve the issue of compensation abroad.

As Zagreb has a long-awaited question of a long-standing solution, the Croatian Without Without the two search regime could lose their goods during the search regime and get a minimum abroad.
The total amount of compensation could cost 20m euros.
A special envoy for the US State Department in charge of disappointment, Edward B. 'Donnell, arrived in Zagreb in October.
Donnell said Washington is ready to discuss a bilateral agreement that would lead to the US citizens of Croatia to the 1996 Thracian Law.
In 1941, the Ustase regime in Croatia -- Nazi Germany -- has ordered the Croatian Jews to submit personal values, such as the bank accounts and each other.
Therefore, these goods gathered, the former German minority members in Croatia, known as the Volkdeschers.
After the war, these goods were transformed by the communist government.
Croatia is on its path to EU membership, while Italy, Germany, Slovenia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are under pressure to resolve the minimum issue.
Zagreb has been negotiating with Austria on a compensation of Volkdeutscher, who was in 1945 from Croatia.
This is why some Germany died in the wake of the cost of Croatian Jews, and this is the issue of the Jewish goods.
According to historian Ivo Gorstein, who lives in Zagreb, the number of Jewish who want compensation should not be too much.
He added, however, that the process should be returned until 1941, when it comes to property.
If the Croatian government accepts the request, it will have to give the goods as separate, or to make money.
One of the main obstacles is that the large part of the goods will be returned to households, forests and agricultural complex or access.
For example, the Ukrainian embassy building reported that a day in Argentina was owned by the Jahahudi family.
Croatian Justice Minister Vesna Scare-Ozbast says the compensation should take place as an independent of the Croatian EU aspirations.
This is an one-year problem that has been under way for more than half of the century, Scare-Ozsyt said, adding that the solution would not be able to avoid it.

The first stop was Pristina.

UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari arrived in Kosovo on Monday (November 21st) and met with UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen.
Ahtisaari will be the next meeting with the Kosovo negotiating team and representatives of the Serb community in the province.
"I am happy that there was no short time after Kosovo is not a candidate for negotiations on the future status of Kosovo," the former Finnish president told reporters after the development of Pristina.
Ahtisaari expects a difficult task to reconciliation between the two optimistic options on the future of the province, which is part of Serbia-Montenegro, but technically technically, as a technical mandate.
The ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo demands independence, while Serbia insists on the right of a sovereignty over the province.
In addition to emphasising the difficult challenge, Ahtisaari was unable to ratify the Serbian Parliament on Monday, calling for the preservation of a decision, which was called for "two autonomy" to Kosovo.
The decision reflects the formation of "more than autonomy, less than independence", as Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica wants to determine the position of its own side.
"Kosovo is part of Serbia and is not only a part of history, but this is a part of the future," Kostunica said at a parliamentary session Monday.
In Pristina, meanwhile, declared independence writers have "negotiating" -- with the earthquakes that have removed Ahtisaari to the UNMIK building.
Ahead of his visit, Jessen-Petersen told reporters that if Kosovo leaders want a quick solution to the status issue, decentralisation, minorities, and the UN must focus on meeting standards, including dialogue with Belgrade.
"The decision to speed up the status of violence could not speed up the implementation of standards and achieved in decentralisation," UNMIK chief said.
The international community, meanwhile, has also approved Serbian President Boris Tadic 'proposal for Kosovo to divide entities similar to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"I do not think the Bosnian model can be implemented in Kosovo because Kosovo has its own power," EU security chief Javier Solana told the daily Koha Ditore.
"The Dayton Accord will not be implemented in Kosovo," Jessen-Petersen said in a similar statement.
US official urges BiH political party leaders to compromise on constitutional reform
On Monday, US Secretary of State Nicholas Burns voiced hope that Bosnian political leaders are ready to return to the Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitution.
(The Washington Times, AP - 22 / 11 / 05; Washington File, Reuters, AP, BBC, VOA, RFE / RL - 21 / 11 / 05)
"We are not going to have.
"However, I am convinced that there are progress in this direction," US Secretary of State Nicholas Burns said. [AFP]
A senior US diplomat said on Monday (November 21st) that the 10th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords (DBA) continues in Washington, while Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) political leaders hope to reach an agreement on return to the constitution.
"What we hope that we hope that the country will agree on half of the political leaders as political", said US Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns. "The constitutional reform process will continue in the coming months before the 2006 elections," said US Secretary of State for Political Affairs.
Nearly ten days ago, leaders of the eight main ruling and opposition parties in BiH met in Brussels to discuss changes to the constitution, part of the DBA.
The leaders also continued their talks on Sunday, ahead of the two-day ceremony, which began on Monday with a conference titled "Dayton: the Balkans and Euro-Atlantic Integration".
"Dayton, internal divisions, a society of society, has a state, because the war is the only way to stop and organise an internal peace," Burns said at a conference sponsored by the US Partnership for Peace. "Ten years later, there are no longer to be no longer a lot," he said.
The citizens of the country -- Croats, Serbs and Muslims -- should be allowed to join the integration of different people in normal countries. "
As a result of the agreements, BiH has left two political entities, including the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska (RS), each of its own government and parliament.
In addition, a national parliament and the government have a tripartite presidency, including members of the three main ethnic groups.
In recent months, the country has been strengthening its relations with the international community, the analysts have also been convinced for reform in the system, which analysts agree that the world is one of the most cancelled political and administrative systems.
"Bosnia cannot stay as a part of a secular state, and nor no other united Europe can be part of a united NATO," Burns said.
According to proposed constitutional amendments, the two sides will continue their presence, but the national parliament and government will now strengthen its authority as well as weakened.
Instead of the three members of the tripartite presidency, the only president will be a president.
US Ambassador to the former UN Richard Holbrooke, who was mediated to the DBA in 1995, urged BiH politicians, particularly Bosnian Serbs, to reach an agreement on constitutional reform.
"I have to say that I have to say, and we are trying to avoid progress in the accordance with the existence of the Dayton Accords," Holbrooke said. "We have to help improve Dayton.
RS, Bosnia and Herzegovina is part of a single state, and should not difference as the last. "
On Tuesday, the BiH delegation, headed by the tripartite presidency, Ivo Miro Jovic and about 40 other Bosnian officials and political members of the presidency, will participate in a teacher at the host of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

The EU flag, a star on the Mavi fall, is now possible to see Albania in every part.
The signal that the Schengen zone has shown its messages to the capital.
People are removing them in Tirana 'significant circumstances.
Meanwhile, "there is no visa," the Opera and Bale Theatre, a prominent symbolic of the communist regime, says in a cafe at the Opera and Bale Theatre.
All these are part of the paper in which the EU decided to ratify the removal of visa liberalisation for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In Albania, a country that has been experienced for decades in the former exercise Enver Hoxha administration, the importance of this is how important.
Since the collapse of Rejimin, several families have been imposed to other parts of Europe -- in reality, the number of families who are not abroad in Albania.
So far, however, many have done it on illegal ways.
Hasan, a Albanian who has been trying to overcome the experience and work in Italy, believes that the major cafe is in front of the same way and doing the two staff in the centre.
"I will go when we come to me, and I will visit them.
Only a hour, "he said.
Following the official newspaper, the EC decision is expected to take effect within 20 days after Albania celebrated its Independent Government on November 28th.
Without the history, travel restrictions will be removed before Christmas.
But there is no good news.
Following the removal of visa liberalisation for Serbia and Macedonia, the EU will punish rules to implement rules and punish more than three months allowing the Schengen zone countries.
Brussels wants to be made clear if visa-free travel does not mean permanent and asylum.
Britain and Ireland are not involved in the Schengen zone and will still be visa for them.

BiH defence sector seeks to stop
Armed and ammunition producers have been working for years to restore the trade level of trade, as they have the conflicts in the 1990s.

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has weakened since the conflict in the 1990s and the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.
At the same time, the country has been closed with four factories: Pretis in Vogosca, Igman in Konjic, Vitz, Zrzec in Sarajevo, Cajec, Mostar, Novi Travo and Tesnik Institute in Bratravo, Novi Soko and Hatraso in Bratrinica and Technica.
In 1986, the defence industry has a total of 225m annually. According to the BiH Foreign Authority in 2009, it was around 30m, or 45m KM.
The effect on the force is more important.
Before the war in BiH, 40,000 people have worked in the defence industry, and today, the figure has dropped up to 3,000.
Many local economist defence industry remains "the concept that BiH continues to be the gold", but industrial violations were passed because of the country &aposs decision to unite the two sides.
"The armed or ammunition does not have a single state level of commercial operations, and all must be spent on the entity level for such a commercial operation," said BiH defence ministry spokesperson Uma Sinanovic. "The State Trade Ministry is based on the final approval of commercial operations."
Some BiH companies, who left their own women, have failed to export exports to some demands such as Switzerland, Britain and Egypt last year.
Igman in Konjic, the most successful company, has exported all ammunition of the Igman in Konjic and won about 15m euros last year.
All arms producers in BiH agree that such companies should be revived for the hospitals.
Furthermore, the state level of foreign trade and economic relations have started working to change the law on Foreign Investment policy to remove restricted restrictions in companies that operate in the defence sector recently, which should be 49% foreign shares.
BiH and Pakhstan, Romania, Romania, Turkey, Egypt and Syria were also hoping to complete inter-state agreements on defence industry co-operation.
According to Dragisa Mekic, deputy director of the foreign trade policy and foreign investment, the agreement with Pakhstan was signed and approved, while Turkey is in the final preparation for an agreement.
Furthermore, Mekic points out a certain level of co-operation between neighbouring countries' defence sectors and the factory agreements.
Furthermore, BiH is trying to boost its programme.
"Our books were part of a number of international missions in Paris, Ankara, ADabi, Kuala Lumpur and other cities," he said.
Mekic added that everything BiH needs.
"We have a long-standing experience in human resources, as well as the organisations and technology skills that need to open foreign markets," he said.
It is a huge army that needs weapons and ammunition.
More than 400,000 soldiers of the former Yugoslavia have more than 400,000 troops, and the small smaller residential ammunition has stopped for years.
The draft decision is offered more recognition of Belgrade -- Pristina talks
Western states are preparing to prepare a new draft resolution that recognises Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials on the future of Kosovo, for four months to reach an agreement on the province ’ s final status.

UN Security Council members will likely receive a new draft decision on Wednesday (June 20th) that paves the way for opening new talks between Belgrade and Pristina on the future of Kosovo.
The document, drafted by the United States and EU countries, said it would be recognised for four months to reach an agreement.
According to Reuters, the talks will not be made without the agreement, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari will focus on implementing the Kosovo plan.
The former Finnish president recommended that Kosovo has been given independence under the EU control, including the constitution, the right to become a state, battle and international organisations.
The Ahtisaari plan calls for protecting the rights of all minority groups in the province, particularly Kosovo Serbs.
According to the plan, an International Civilian Representative will appoint the implementation of the agreement.
The person, which will be deployed by the UN and the EU, will have to veto the laws and bring authorities to power.
While KFOR continues to ensure security in the province, the EU will be postponed to assist a police mission that would help "affect the rule of law institutions, fair and cleaning".
Kosovo Albanians, who have accepted 90% of the province ’ s population of 2 million people, have accepted the plan, while Serbia, which insists on continuing some sovereignty over Kosovo.
Russia, which supports Belgrade 'request for continuing talks on the province' future, threatened to use its power to block any UN Security Council resolution that would not be acceptable for Serbia.
The Western countries, who hope that the possibility of this possibility, have offered to allow Moscow to become a final proposal to appoint a envoy to ethnic Serbs, which would be changed as a model of ethnic Serbs.
Belgrade has sparked control over the province, after the NATO air movement.
Before that, Serbian forces have taken strong measures against ethnic Albanians who want independence.
During a visit to Athens on Tuesday, Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic reiterated Belgrade 'call for continuing talks with Pristina, while reiterating its stance on full independence for Kosovo.
"We have to talk, we want to speak, and we are preparing to reach an agreement.
We are preparing to see all options, because we believe that any compromise is better for any consensus, the impressive solution, "he said." Our position is that our country will not give the sovereignty and territorial integrity. "
However, there are doubts that the new talks between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders will be more efficient than the outcome of Ahtisaari last year.
Nearly 14 months of talks ended in early this year without a significant change in their positions.
The Kosovo administration, which pushed for a quick solution to the province &aposs status issue, said it is opposed to any new talks with Belgrade.
"The restructuring of the Ahtisaari package is unacceptable," Belgrade-based Beta news agency quoted Kosovo negotiating team spokesperson Smilder Hyseni as saying on Tuesday. "Kosovo status could be determined with alternative ways.
This will be the countries that have blocked the process in the Security Council, "he said.
Meanwhile, Ahtisaari said on Tuesday that Russia expects to block a Council resolution based on its own plan.
However, he said, Kosovo would likely be independence by the end of this year.
Finnish television quoted him as telling Moscow that a solution could be resolved outside the UN and the United States' support if Moscow veto.

Romva and Moldova signed a long-awaited border agreement Monday (November 8th), preparing the importance of closer co-operation between the two neighbours.
The agreement was signed at a ceremony in Bucharest, including Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi and Moldovan Prime Minister Vlad Filat at at a regional summit on the Danube River.
The agreement focuses on a number of technical issues, including the 68km border, joint construction projects, use of water resources, infrastructure and telecommunications facilities, as well as border resources and control.
The document also regular the execution of various activities, such as fisheries, disaster and forests.
The agreement was also an important time for both countries after years of negotiations.
The Soviet Union in 1940 is part of Romania, and then Moldova, which declared independence in 1991, expects critical parliamentary elections on November 28th.
Moldova was the only neighbouring country that Bucharest has not signed the agreement.
Romania hopes the border between Moldova and Moldova will also join the 25 European countries, including visa-free Schengen zone by March 2011.
"We have signed this agreement," Baconschi said in a joint statement with Palat after the award ceremony, adding that "some environments in Moldova are" detailed plans on the agenda of Romania ".
The minister said that Moldovan communists are open to constant charges that Romania has territorial claims in their countries.
The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, one of the four parties in the ruling European Integration (AIE) coalition, said Monday that the agreement would open the way for the launch of European agricultural practices in his country.
European Commission (EC) President Jose Manuel Barroso, who was in Bucharest on Monday, welcomed the signing of the agreement as "an excellent example of success when it comes to mutual interest".
At the opening of the Danube summit, Barroso noted that the move was important for Romania 'bid to join the Schengen bid, adding that it is "a demonstration that Moldova is approaching the EU".
In a statement later, Romanian minister Baconschi said he was confident that Barroso "was" convinced that the support of Barroso is "only because they would continue to restore bilateral relations within the framework of the European monitoring.
"We want the Moldovan Republic to monitor this way, and we want this border, when all conditions are fulfilled to the EU to become a internal border," he said.
Discussions could be Without EU Accession Executive Movement
[the] EU] has given Bulgaria and Romania to the EU to the Union to spread the methods that would lead to the necessary reforms for accession.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 21 / 04 / 03
At the latest EU meeting in Copenhagen, the requests to Bulgaria and Romania to show the necessary reforms needed for joining the EU.
Talks were always discriminated, but many questions are leaving.
Acis Community (a series of EU normalisation and rules) is only a technical action, with the fact that EU rules are reflected by national laws.
If the more deeply discussed, the real functioning of local institutions, social and economic performance as a precondition for the image of Acis.
Therefore, the European Commission highlights reforms in public administration and legal areas and the need to fight corruption.
The reforms that the EU wants to take place are more geographic than the need for the creation of a "classic" market economy, together with a liberal democracy.
That is why the EU is not the product of a institutional structure, designed to develop a organisational development and advance.
In particular, the first of them -- national conditions, institutional and functioning -- are aiming to develop closer economic development.
The Union needs a series of institutional warnings, which will not be demanded in a different situation.
Despite the current economic differences, the EU is a part of interest economies and communities.
Therefore, Bulgaria and Romania are facing a major obstacle, which will not be eliminated in the development of development.
In Bulgaria and Romania, the EU average is under 28%.
Inflation is not easy to meet the Maastricht criteria on the rise of interest rates, budget deficits and foreign currency change, and these criteria could block economic growth.
Even during the pre-accession period, the autonomy of the economic policy could be limited in a front, and an Ozeran economic policy could produce the capacity to deal with poor poor.
The "economic policy" is a question that must be taken in mind. In 2004, the first expansion of enlargement is likely to be done, and it is very much more than the definitely.
The EU enlargement with the future is committed to the internal mechanism of the Union, and it can have to make a difficult test to create "the deepening economic performance of economic performance and creating a joint security policy in the region in recent years, which has been based on economic challenges and created by a joint security policy, and to create different views on the internal issues of the EU" coalition.
A key outcome is that Acquis' impression will be to bring the goods that will provide specific benefits and not to reduce the decline.
"It is not easy to identify these goods and account, and that could create a confidence problem for state officials, if the price is much higher than expected.
Participation talks will be under disciplinary detention.
Reforms for the EU accession process will be more constructive and efficient.
While the reality that Acis' immunity is part of me, relations with the EU seems to be more rich with international financial institutions.
The EU could serve as an optimism for the development and modernisation of the modernisation and modernisation.
Since the benefits of institutional reforms, financial aid could be used, many major differences could be created.
The EU will also provide "fear" economic "if uncertainty and uncertainty over the world are taking place.
However, there are many issues that the map is open:
There are no political problems that are unresolved, and the option of these problems is in place, and these options should also warn the best primary external conditions, according to internal circumstances and basic foreign conditions.
The policy, which will be monitored, should be in front of a free economy (low inflation), ensuring a state control over the business climate, ensuring strict budget borders, but should not be pragmatic, when it comes to pragmatically passed.
For instance, markets should be held in effect.
The policy must block quickly decisions, because these decisions made by the repeated "prestigious voting" will be very high if they do not get the truth.
A example of this situation is the liberal liberalisation of the capital account.
The national industrial industry depends on how local sectors enter the main industrial networks in Europe.
State officials can play a role in this issue, using various policies, such as tax evasion and better business conditions for internal investment.
This claim does not mean to continue to support heavy damage and reduce the lack of successful companies.
Several improvements should be made.
For this, the EU and other experts -- especially from the European Investment Bank -- have a very important role in financial assistance.
The experience in Portugal, Spain and Greece is on the basis of the EU aid, nor can be made a major development.
In addition to the state budget, more funding for education and health care needs.
This issue will require more active interest in the coming years.
As it comes to the structure, a better functioning economy and taxes will be able to make significant progress.
The agriculture sector, which is a large number of active population in GDP and is working in the agriculture sector, will be one of the most cautious problems in the accession talks.
This sector should not be unfortunately, when it comes to the EU executive support.
The economic problem could be even more than the consolidation of agricultural areas, the young population has forced to find jobs in the city.
This could be revived, if other sectors do not provide enough employment, the former "rural census explosion" could be revived.
Given the growing willingness to work abroad, the business force could be an opportunity to avoid a major social crisis or prevent a major society crisis.
Thus, both countries must stop a type of transformation of Latin American. It is a successful issue of the problem with the EU.
In the near future, a "Great Market" could be a "in the near future.
The citizens of the transition economies who are working abroad to the EU are providing significant amounts to their countries, and this private transfer is creating a security network.

However, as part of the Serbian Capital project, the airport will be transformed into a regional air traffic network.
Today, loans or airport will be invested by 500m euros and 700m euros in the project through commercial activities.
According to Serbian Transport Minister Marija Raseta Vukosavljevic, the two international fears in the centre of the centre of Belgrade enabling the city to unite any transport way.
The reconstruction operations that aim to boost foreign and quality capacity mechanisms are not only the mechanisms, but also the restructuring of operations with the latest technology equipment.
Police and airport security began training in Belgrade on special security measures needed to create air traffic at the New York pipeline. For the first time, Serbia-Montenegro will be organised by the United States for 11 years.
The New York aircraft, which will be co-organised by JAT and Staria Airlines, is scheduled for two days.
Despite some obstacles facing passengers to the United States, the flights are expected to enter as soon as possible.
The US Transport Security Agency has even arrived in the country.
Several options are submitted to expansion industries at the airport.
A five-star hotel construction is among the plans, as well as the restoration of accommodation research, as well as a five-star hotel that would enable conference on business.
The planned railway will not only be able to connect the airport to the city, but will also be able to meet goods in the cargo centre, part of the project.
Currently, the US Agency for Reconstruction and Development has yet to be found in the feasibility study, which is prepared by the US Agency for Reconstruction and Development, but a 34 hectares of the airport could be used in the environment.
The work on the international terminal is scheduled to be completed in May 2004.
As the plans for the airport have won, the problem that the facility will be the name of the facility.
Some have suggested that Zoran Djindjic, the prime minister of Serbia, who lost the assassination of Serbia.
The most appropriate willingness is the prime minister, as the New York international airport transferred President John F. F. Kennededy, argues that Serbia is the most important efforts to open Serbia into the world.
Experts Without EU Integration with Western Balkans' Integration
Some experts say the EU is needed to develop and support its strategy for the Western Balkans.
(EUobserver.com - 19 / 03 / 03; European Stability Initiative)
Regional experts on Southeast Europe have called on the EU to develop its approach on the Western Balkans -- to improve the impact of the Union &aposs assistance to the region.
Experts who attended a debate at the European Parliament &aposs Foreign Relations Committee last month said the EU needs to show more determination to ensure the support for the Western Balkan countries' prospects for membership in the more realistic foundations.
The increase was made in a bid to prepare the Stability Pact Conference in May. The conference will also be a preparation for the European Council meeting in Thessaloniki in June.
The Western Balkan countries, which are given the safety of EU member states, will be invited to "a strategic summit" in the framework of the Greek forum.
Albania, Macedonia and Croatia signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (IOA) with the EU.
Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro have yet to sign.
Croatia applied the application for EU membership in February. In early 2007, the application was made to join the Union with Bulgaria and Romania.
Albania and Macedonia are planning to monitor Croatia in this year.
Vladimir Gligorov of the Vienna International Institute for Economic Studies, says the IOA approach is very slow, and the Union has not shown that people in the region do not support the right right people.
Gligorov is approaching a doubt that the EU is determined to provide support for the region.
In a speech to members of the European Parliament, European Stabilisation Initiative (ASD) President Gerald Kucus told members of the European Parliament that the Western Balkans region is two basic threats today. The organisation has dropped social and economic reduction.
The EU could help overcome the social and economic problems, he said, adding that the Western Balkan countries will continue to continue their reform processes and the fight against organised crime.
He also suggested that the Union is trying to develop its own alliance vehicles.
A new report published by the ESR said the summit in Thessaloniki had three measures for success.
Of them, it will reveal a concrete EU bid in the Western Balkans, which would mean more resources and more interest in the region with EU institutions.
The report said that a serious determination to ensure unity in the Western Balkans is a lot of major financial resources, while showing new aid strategies.
The second framework has so far been to demonstrate the implementation of the deeply details from the unity politics.
According to the same document, the third framework will be the determination of the level of assistance between the candidate countries -- Romania and Bulgaria -- which will not be able to grow more, as well as the Western Balkan countries.
The ESR report said it would be planned for the Western Balkans in 2006 and proposed that 500m euros, only one of the GDP in the region, but even Bulgaria and Romania are low than the same year.
A turning point on Kurdish problem
Turkey, which is increasingly opened by the state and Kurdish movements, has been a critical period on "the Kurdish problem".
By Anna Wood for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 08 / 08 / 11
The BDP is boycotting parliament and stopped the seats of the elected Kurdish lawmakers, as they gathered at the Diyarbakir, which is a majority of the Kurdish population. [Reuters]
The BDP, which supports the Kurdish population, has won 36 lawmakers in the June general elections.
Although the winner of independent candidates supported by the BDP was the beginning of the beginning, the situation was false after the electoral dismissing of Hatip Dicle, a electoral lawmaker.
In response to the decision, some of the parties' lawmakers have boycotted the decision by failing to elect a member of parliament.
Addressing the incidents since the beginning, Ley University professor and Kurdish expert Henri Barkey said the situation is very concerned.
He described Dicle as a "step forward that could undermine Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and AKP support for the Kurdish Appeals".
Benzer developments came to the country &aposs largest opposition party, the Republican People 'Party (CHP), but the party' boycott process ended in a consensus with the AKP.
However, the BDP seems to see a solution in the short term for candidates supported by the BDP.
Talks between the state and party representatives have not made any consequences until now.
The decision to enter parliament is criticised by some observers, such as the National Institute for Strategic Studies, who think the BDP has boycotted significant opportunities by boycotting parliament.
"The BDP had more promises in the amendment process, and other alternatives in the political field, both in the political field and to be legitimate to legitimate Kurdish demands," Natasa told SETimes.
According to the Natasa, the party has repeatedly convinced the candidates who have not been sentenced to prison, "could make progress in the talks and showed that they are serious about the change of the Turkish state."
Democratic autonomy
Two incidents, held in mid-July, caused the country to increase the tension.
Those incidents were attacked by the PKK in Diyarbakir, where Kurdish political activities in Turkey were conducted by the PKK, and the death of 13 soldiers.
Turkish soldiers have caused the rise of Turkish nationalism in the country to increase the outcome of PKK attacks and further deepening discrimination between Turks and Kurds. [Reuters]
This development has led to increase Turkish national nationalism with a new energy, and the rise for the Kurdish people and the BDP.
In the second case, the nationalist Kurdish movement could be described as a turning point for the development of its nationalist Kurdish movement.
The Democratic Society Congress (DTK) announced that it plans to declare a "democratic autonomy" for the Kurds in Turkey on the same day.
"This problem can only be resolved with Kurds' recognition of the people and the status of equal level.
In response to policies that threatened to continue the presence of the Kurdish people, the status quo does not want to live. "
"The problem is important that the plan is not only to end violence and conflict.
At the same time, a democratic society will also provide the governance stake. "
Tuncel also emphasised the DTK 'statements.
"Democratic autonomy has two boys.
First, we can be recognised as a peacekeeping project, and the process of resolving the Kurdish issue is resolving democratic and peaceful ways. "
"All ID in Turkey is the democracy project that would allow cultural and religious affairs to express freedom and equality," he said.
The real effect of the democratic autonomy, which he described as a "beautiful" threat to the territorial integrity of the Turkish state ", but the real effect of the Kurdish politics showed that the real effect of a new era.
The BDP, the DTK, KCK, the PKK and prison leader Abdullah Ocalan, has been divided into an extraordinary and effective division among different organisations and authors, but the nationalist Kurdish movement is developing, developing and international level.
As the state, the state, media and the public see the BDP as an extension of the PKK, concerns about the links between these groups are clearing a clear way.
According to the Natasa, the BDP should convince people, if it wants to do with the state agenda.
"For the Kurds to make more progress in the political front, the BDP or the opposition and elements of the party, assets and the Kurds' demands are not a threat to the unity and stability of the Turkish state.
However, they are now doing fully. "
A free region in Turkey could be implemented
The DTK announcement is still question: How would it be full of a system based on democratic autonomy in Turkey, and what is the current political climate?
There may be an effective solution in some areas where the tensions between ethnic or religious clashes and minority groups are among the majority groups.
Spain, which represents a roadmap for the establishment of the 1978 constitution, has been a tightening country as one of the successful achievements in a peaceful transition to autonomy.
Both host the communities that have been recognised by the state as historically recognised by the state, Bask and Katalonia are managed by the autonomy parliamentary and courts, and fear the federal government with the federal government, which is approved by the head of the government.
The deaths of the PKK have also begun Kurdish nationalism. [Reuters]
Canada could be an example of countries who fight autonomy demands, particularly in the province of Quebec.
Although controversy over autonomy level is still under way, there is no peaceful solution in the political process.
However, Turkey and the Middle East are very different, as opponents of autonomy against autonomy in Turkey, with geopolitical and diagnos-cultural facts, Spain and Canada.
One of the factors that any systems based on political autonomy is needed, is that the Turkish state has been uncertainly opposed for years: the local governance.
As official, the central state has a lot of local policies, which is both effective and most of the identity system.
In a country where the Kurdish language was illegal by the 1990s and the speech of the speech of speech can even be impossible, even if the idea of autonomy -- has been restricted in some areas.
Juha Raikka, a professor at the Turkish University in Finland, says that such solutions should be tolerated.
"Temel is a general acceptance of the solution.
Leaders agree that Quebec is autonomy.
Finland acknowledges that the Aland island is autonomy.
Therefore, regional autonomy has been working in the fields. "
KB, the founder of the bloc, a political author and the Kurdistan Committee, is suspected that Turkey is ready for such autonomy.
"How will the autonomy be possible?
Before men, Kurds must be recognised as constitutional and guarantee judges. "
According to Natasa, the situation is not ready, but also in the state level.
"Turkish authorities, institutions and political parties are based on the part of the state union and stability," Natasa said. "The idea of the autonomous Kurdistan Workers' border with the Kurdistan province in Iraq is undermining a stake in security and unity."
According to Natasa, the unilateral decisions such as the DTK have no chance for a real change in Turkey.
"Any amendment to the structure of the Turkish state and institutions, including the transfer of Gul, has to be done in the framework of constitutional and administrative reforms that Turkish people and officials will accept."
Instead, a common opinion is that any possible consensus between the AKP, which is actually complicated with nationalist nationalism to vote with the unfortunate Kurdish census.
"The constitution is here.
Unfortunately, Turkey needs a new constitution.
If Ankara does not do something on this issue, all causes have dropped. "
Meanwhile, a solution has been postponed and unstable, the chance of constructive co-operation is reduced.
"If it does not exist, the issues are difficult to stop.
People are falling the truth: because of the unexpected important developments, they have always been able to take even a simple compromise in the conflict, "he said.

The Macedonian government is preparing a new law that will change the Charter of Communities and the group to the OSCE.
However, controversial debate over the recommendations that the European Commission calls for the registration process would be free.
The current law recognises a single committee for people from a certain test.
The Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOK) is recognised as a representative of the Orthodox test, while the Islamic Community (IRC) represents the Muslim class.
The COK, the IC and the Roman Catholic Church have also reportedly discussed the continuation of the current system, instead of allowing more than one of the test to be established.
Supporters of this idea say liberalisation would increase more freedom in order to choose religious groups to choose their own type.
According to the MOK, however, liberalisation will open the door to the Ohrid Patriarch in Macedonia, where Jovan Vraniskovski, a conservative paper based on the Macedonian Orthodox Church.
Vraniskovski is currently in prison for the Idrizovo prison, who currently wants donations in the bishop area.
Meanwhile, the IC says the proposed amendments would lead to an independent Bekaci Community, which is opposed to the amendments.
After a meeting between Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and MOK officials, the talks on amendment of the law will be announced.
However, a certain solution was not elected.
The COK sent a letter to the Serbian Orthodox Church for decades to propose dialogue on the dispute.
The Serbian church continues to refuse to the MOK for a religious declaration of independence, instead of autonomy.
However, the MOK insists its own constitution and a church with its own president.

Experts are still facing significant obstacles to purchase separate circumstances in Croatia, as well as the problem is blocking EU talks.

Croatia will not participate in EU talks on free and capital transportation.
EU experts concluded that the Croatian property mechanisms are not in line with European standards and should be destroyed.
"Still, there are many legal restrictions," the European Commission report said. "EU countries do not have the necessary rights that would allow them to buy property in Croatia."
As a tourist industry, Croatia has a major market for foreigners as a potential property market.
EU citizens are interested in purchasing software houses and agencies in particular coastal areas.
However, EU fears in the country are not willing to open foreigners, with a fear that will be sold from a territory.
According to law, foreign individuals and companies who want to be property in Croatia need to be signed by the foreign ministry, the foreign ministry of justice must be signed.
This process could take years.
The foreign ministry has decided to decide on any application, while Croatia and its application is unable to be separate among the country.
The procedure for the citizens of Italy, Germany and Austria is quickly fast for their citizens.
This is a number of Croatian citizens who live in these countries.
Foreign individuals and companies cannot have agriculture or forests in Croatia.
For the first time, the federal, regional and municipal authorities are offered to protect something.
However, they refuse to use the right to purchase themselves, but the property can be offered to foreign citizens and companies.
Other EU members, who are interested in the tourism, have also faced similar problems with Croatia in the accession process.
Another example that can be given this, the negotiators can complete the country &aposs property market in seven years.
According to the agreements signed with the EU, Croatia must liberalise its market by 2009.
Turkish Cypriots undebate in Nicosia

Turkish Cypriots were discovered on Tuesday (January 9th) in Nicosia on a high-level transition point in the ethnically divided town of Cyprus, which was held in late 2005.
Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat announced a decision by the end of last year to remove a controversial chapter in the Turkish side of the Ledras Cadin, a key symbolic of Nicosia and a key symbols of the island ’ s 32-year division.
According to Greek Cypriots, the metal was built in a bid to boost Turkish troops in the region.
Talat plans to eliminate the structure were criticised by Turkish chief of the General Staff, General Jasar Bureau.
"The opening of the Ledras Cadaster is not a problem for us, but such steps must be accomplished," the AFP quoted General Talat as saying in a meeting in Ankara on Friday, noting that the Turkish military had informed the views.
After the meeting, Talat said that despite Ankara opposing, the Greek Cypriot authorities' decision to reopen the Ledras Cadaster is still valid.
"Our goal is the opening of the transition," said Ozen Murat, a senior Turkish Cypriot interior official on Tuesday. "We have to do with the Turkish Cypriots."
Among other preconditions that Greek Cypriots have suggested the reconstruction of the Ledras Cadaster, Turkish soldiers are the restoration of unrest and the restoration of neighbouring buildings.
"The aim to open the Ledras Cadasars is a safe movement and a mutual trust environment through clean and communication between the two communities," Greek Cypriot government spokesman Kristodulos Pashiardis said Tuesday.
Turkish Cypriots, who hoped to open the way to regain UN peacekeeping talks with the Greek Cypriot part, described the decision to destabilise the controversy as a good trend.
However, Pasiardis said on Tuesday that the fall of the high-flight could not withdraw on the Turkish Cypriots' island or not a compromise.
"It should be removed as an urgent climate to eliminate this law, nor should be represented with the compromises that will be given our entity," the Cyprus News Agency quoted him as saying.
A question about the Greek Cypriot authorities' plans to eliminate the National Guard in Ledras Cadardis, and Pasiardis said the government is ready to debate the proposals for a transition point on the main island, saying the government is ready to discuss the UN Peace Force in Cyprus.
Since 2003, none of the barricades have been opened in the centre of Nicosia, where the barricades were first in 1963, as the first of the ethnic conflict between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.

The European Commission (EC) announced a series of proposals, including liberalisation of trade with the northern part of the island, as well as 259m euros in donation, as well as the 259m euros, in an interview with Turkish Cypriots' support for international efforts to reunify Cyprus.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said the EU continues its long-term goal for Cyprus to unite Turkish and Greek Cypriots.
"The goal is to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and use different vehicles," Verheugen said.
In a referendum on April 24th, Greek Cypriots rejected the UN reunification plan, while Turkish Cypriots approved the plan.
As a result of the vote, only the Greek Cypriot part of Cyprus joined the EU on 1 May.
"With the best caution, the Turkish Cypriots did not leave the past," Verheugen said.
Only recognised by Turkey, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (KKTC) has lived in international ambitious and sanctions since 1974.
Currently, Turkish Cypriot products are not exported abroad under the KKTC.
However, the new proposals will be allowed to free trade with North Cyprus, including food products.
Verheugen cited the infrastructure projects in the area of tourism initiatives, agriculture and electricity and telecommunications between potential projects that will be financed by the EU.
The EU is intended to support joint projects that both the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot authorities will include, the commissioner said.
Among the recommendations that the Council of Europe will take effect after a meeting in September, the trade convention was organised through the "Reviewal Hall" of the two communities in the island.
The EC move is a key political milestone for the Turkish Cypriots, while Verheugen stressed that the recommendations have not mean recognition of the KKTC as direct or inevitable.
"We are not interested in the most frequent interest in the Eastern Mediterranean, because they see a Turkish state in the Mediterranean," Verheugen said.
Nevertheless, the proposed Greek and Greek Cypriots were spread in the entity.
Greek Foreign Ministry spokesperson George Kumikos described the EU as "a negative point" in economic issues with the KKTC.
Meanwhile, Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister George Jakovu said the package was based on the wrong political presence and concrete laws.
In particular, the Greek side has criticised free trade provisions without the right to veto.
However, Greece nor the Greek Cypriots are not expected to appeal to the 259m-euro hydrop, which must be one of the Council of Europe.

Del Ponte, who has repeatedly said Mladic is in Serbia, called for authorities to arrest him.
Karadzic is widely believed to be hiding in Republika Srpska, the entity, the Serb administration in BiH.
Gotovina, who has been in losses since 2001, has been charged with atrocities against Serb civilians during a 1995 attack on the Croatian Army.
Del Ponte claims that Croatian authorities know that the general is in the case.
"Both my office and the Croatian government know that General Ante Gotovina is in the reason," del Ponte said.
The tribunal will continue to ask the international community to assist the most wanted figures to justice, he said, adding that these persons have no success in capture and trial.
"I will not take into account the possibility of this possibility.
Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina will be arrested by the end of the year and will be transferred to the tribunal.
The court will not close the doors until Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina are in front of the judiciary, "he said.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said on Friday that his government was "no talks with General Gotovina".
"Croatian service usually know that he is in Croatia and what is," he said, adding that the fugitive will be arrested so far.

Sarkozy obstacles between Turkey and the EU
The French president has become a concrete bitter of Europe 'stance against Turkey' EU bid, but the dialogue between Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has increased prospects.
By A. Now for Southeast European Times -- 20 / 04 / 10

In Paris earlier this month, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris, cautioning that France could revive Turkey &aposs position on EU membership, but cautioned some optimism.
Erdogan met with Sarkozy on April 8th.
The strong opposition of the French president has created a continuous problem to Ankara.
Turkey has the largest sixth GDP in Europe with 64.8 billion euros, and its growth has reached around 6.5% over the past five years.
This figure is not only higher than all other candidates from all other candidate countries, but also has an inefficient level for many EU member states.
Turkey and European partners have played significant role in tasks such as Iran 'nuclear crisis, the security situation in Afghanistan and improving stability in Iraq.
Nevertheless, the country has not begun the role of a growing preliminary plan.
Sarkozy argues that "Europe is undermining its borders" and that "all countries have to be a European member."
The French president insists that Turkey is not in these borders.
This was the official stance of Sarkozy, since Sarkozy arrived in power in 2007.
However, a recent visit by Erdogan -- which Sarkozy will monitor the Ankara trip -- could signal a change to Turkey.
"The most important outcome of Erdogan 'visit is that Sarkozy accepts Turkey this year," Dr. Cengiz Meditar, from the Bahjesean University in Istanbul, told SETimes.
"Sarkozy has changed the idea of tobacco policy issues outside Turkey since the presidential mandate," he said. "However, at the last time, the French business sector, which has lost almost all competitors against Turkish markets.
"We can now see that Sarkozy is now in a way to give the strong opposition to Turkey."
Erdogan said all aspects of bilateral relations, including the French president and military relations, have discussed the possibility of co-operation in resolving regional and global problems.
"I hope that we will develop Sarkozy this year and we will discuss our steps towards the future," he said.
Turkey and France have similar views on the NATO allies and many foreign policy issue.
Nevertheless, the latest French official visiting Turkey was former President France Mitore and former President France in 1992.
The predecessor of Sarkozy, President Jacques Chirac, was seen as Turkish friendship.
With Chirac 'support, Turkey began accession talks with the EU in 2004.
However, Sarkozy opposes full membership in Turkey, blocking the opening of the 35 necessary chapters of accession talks.
Ankara has not been a strong political support from France in its efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue, but another problem.
France, he says, is not France, but "Sarkozy" is France.
"Sarkozy aims to win the support of voters from Islam, which can also oppose Turkey," Sarkozy said. "If Sarkozy is losing the 2012 elections, Sarkozy said." Sarkozy could be elected from a new policy that will have a new policy or elected president to Turkey. "
Other EU members, such as Britain, Italy and some northern European countries, have strong support for Turkey 'full EU membership, emphasising the geographical importance that the country has a bridge on the Islamic world.
Germany, meanwhile, has offered Turkey a "impressive partnership" that is not acceptable to full membership, so Ankara has offered a "efficient partnership".
One of the most powerful supporters of Turkey 'EU membership is Spain, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
The chapters on education and food safety are likely to open for Turkey by the end of the year, Spanish state minister for European affairs Diego Lopez Gaido said recently.

The international community has made it clear that the chance for BiH to Euro-Atlantic integration depends on full co-operation with the ICTY, including the transfer of indictees indicted for war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict.
RS has not yet arrested a single war crimes suspect, and has not been able to co-operate with the tribunal recently, BiH has not been invited to join NATO &aposs Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme.
Karadzic, one of the 20 ICTY indictees in the situation, has been frozen since 1996, and has reportedly been hiding in the eastern mountains of one supporters.
Following NATO decision to postpone its participation in the PfP, the top international envoy in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, announced a broader measures targeting co-operation with the ICTY.
Under the measures, 59 Bosnian Serb officials believed to have blocked the process were last.
These include the leader of the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), the leader of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS), and RS Parliament Speaker Dragan Kalinic and the entity interior minister, Zoran Djeric.
On Tuesday, the government is urging all the necessary changes to the interior ministry to ensure that the entity police will have operational power to capture war crimes indictees.
The document also urges BiH to prepare a bill on the establishment of a textile textile that will be investigated during the BiH conflict, investigations, documentation and assessment.
In addition to full support for NATO 'participation in Euro-Atlantic structures through the PfP and EU Stabilisation and Association Process, lawmakers also called for "condemning" the representatives of all constituent citizens in BiH "to condemn war crimes committed by representatives of the citizens.
Earlier in the day, 44 of lawmakers participating in the special session Tuesday chose Dusan Stojicic, 40, the new president of parliament.
Stojicic, a SDS spokesperson, is not believed to be among those who helped Karadzic evade justice, the AP reported.
However, Ashdown urged RS on Tuesday to implement the decision on the geographical islands of the BiH Constitutional Court in February.
In a letter to RS Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic, Ashdown cautioned that the amendments to the removal of the RS cabinet recently passed to the RS cabinet have not been sufficient to the court decision.
In particular, he noted, the cabinet has left the couple of Foca / Srbje, especially as the double Foca / Srbje.
Ashdown said the court decision is clear and difficult, adding that Mikerevic had a personal responsibility in ensuring the crisis.

This will provide a different, more poor Balkan image.
Furthermore, it will recognise us as an advocate of the system, "he said.
Before the Copenhagen decision, Peshcheja worked on March 30th in Albania to open a 14 Macedonian border areas, including Polikastro and Medisiopoli and Kustendil municipalities in Bulgaria.
The foresee studies in Macedonia are being conducted by the Macedonian public utility, and the establishment of the Authority Treaty included the action plan.
This year, the board celebrates the UN 'decision to declare 2011 as the Agriculture Charter.
"More than 65% of the 38m-euro network, which is an excellent rate in creating this network.
European standards are successful to an average of 35%.
We have a greater success rate in the first years, but now we have a comprehensive approach and we have a higher quality, "he said.
He said Macedonian authorities are planning to export their readiness to countries in the region, as many of them do not have sufficient tools and other elements needed.
"Macedonian Orthodox supplies are sufficient and the agency is preparing to help other countries, especially Kosovo and Bulgaria.
Nevertheless, the countries must focus on legal practices in accordance with bilateral co-operation, "he said.
Authorities predict that citizens are 44m euros, including the latest Agriculture Bajramp.
Macedonia has been charged as a national exhibition and heritage, protected by the constitution.
The country signed a number of international agreements and consortium affecting the forestry sector, and approved them.
Although the NGO was recognised and organised by the NGO, all ministries of the Agriculture Agency are repeatedly supported by the Macedonian government, including the Local Government Agency, municipalities and the public utility Macedonian Orthodox.
This year, the ambassadors who served in Macedonia, attended the Agriculture Bajramp.

The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday (November 23rd) unveiled two new aspects of the 17 Eurozone countries' authority on national budget and strengthen control over the members facing serious financial problems.
The regulations are part of a three-option plan to resolve the crisis in the Eurozone, which is part of a joint euro plan for the "Stabilisation Team civilians", which defines the economic priorities of the EU in 2012.
"In order to return, EU member states have to increase their quality, as well as to boost their quality, as well as to the Eurozone," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
"The targets of this package -- economic growth, fiscal stability, budget disciplinary -- are linked to one," Barroso said at a joint press conference with EU Economy and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn. "We need to strengthen the existence of the existing situation in Europe, which we need to strengthen peace."
In one of the two new arrangements proposed, the Eurozone countries' budget adoptions for the next year and the Eurogroup will then submit their own parliament.
The countries must do so before October 15th, when they must announce their budget plans for the next 12 months.
The second legal measure will allow the Eurozone countries who live serious financial problems or help from other countries in the region to replace the European Financial Stabilisation Fund or the IMF with the IMF.
Earlier this year, the Eurozone has suggested a joint euro bonds as one of the purchase of the crisis in the Eurozone.
The EC presented the issue on Wednesday with a 38 page Judiciary Belene, which submitted a detailed analysis of the three electoral analysis for the Stabilisation Team civilians, supported by the 17-nation club.
The final decision is expected to participate in all stakeholders and after a broad consultation that ended on January 8th.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who opposes the idea of monitoring the euro, reiterated his stance on Wednesday.
Merkel also reflects calls for the European Central Bank (ECB) to expand its role in efforts to deal with the debt crisis.
"It is very important that the commission has already offered a variety of euros to recommendations for various euros, one of course is inappropriate," the German parliament quoted him as saying.
In an open increase in the same day, Germany could sell a decade of 10-year bonds worth only 3.9 billion euros from the market.
This academic sparked concerns that Europe is unlikely to prevent it from the crisis.
The threats that France, the second largest country in the Eurozone country in the eurozone, has increased in recent years, when the threats that France could lose three SAA credit rating.
"The crisis has been deeply deepened, while Merkel is one of the survival policy of this job," Bloomberg, a senior member of the Council of European Foreign Relations in Berlin, quoted Sebastian Dullien as saying in an telephone interview Thursday. "It is only the last spring of the euro, or even more than the
The strategy has failed. "
One of the main searches against the idea of a joint Eurozone, Berlin will be able to catch the financial problems of the major country &aposs debt.
Petar Ganev, a senior economist at the Institute for Economy (CEE), is expected to discuss a serious debate in the coming weeks.
"It is clear that there are different positions on the issue," Ganev told SETimes. "The question of the huge debts with the unit of the Middle East member states is a new debt that will be completed by all eurozone countries.
The new debt will be a little stage to believe that the current debt, which has come to a unsustainable level, will help solve the problems that have made the current debt. "
Other experts and analysts believe the steps to resolve the Eurozone debt crisis would be an important element, but stressed the need for further measures.
"There is a panic about the global debt and this is why we are in a liquidity crisis (both countries and the banks," Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies, told SETimes. "The Likidic crisis can only be able to foster the ECB crisis.
However, the ECB could do it only if more fiscal integration and the euro is estimated.
Therefore, the euro bonds may be one of the basic elements of any crisis. "
Former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu expressed doubt that the Eurozone would not act quickly to revive its common policy and not to take a deeper fiscal integration.
"Financial rules, as well as sanctions.
However, financial rules are not sufficient, but not enough to keep a common treasury, "he said." It is not enough to replace a financing that would admit the provisions and penalties. "
Furthermore, the Eurozone needs a joint currency that met to stay in order to live. "
The policy should provide "a common arrangement and control of financial assets, as well as a deeply financial integration" through joint decision mechanisms, Daianu said, noting the need for a "common treasure" to cover joint euro bonds.
According to Daianu, a deeply deeply political integration for all.
"A currency union, sufficient fiscal support (radical organisations) cannot function without a joint arrangement and financial markets," the former minister said. "Eurozone bonds will be a step forward on this issue."
EU leaders are expected to discuss the package and their ideas at the summit on December 9th.

Romania aims to increase use of EU funds four times
Is the country achieved great improvements to EU funds?
Leonard Orban, the name of a new ministry on this issue, says the matter is on the issue.
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 25 / 11 / 11
Minister Leonard Orban (left) speaks with SETimes correspondent Paul Ciocoiu. [Victor Barlic / SETimes]
Former EU Commissioner Leonard Orban was appointed by the European Union Ministry in charge of a efficient use of EU funds established by Romania recently.
Romania is the most difficult of the bloc members.
SETimes correspondent Paul Ciocoiu speaks about the challenges of the issue with Orban.
SETimes: What is the decision to form a ministry to withdraw EU funds as special?
Leonard Orban: This questionnaire will give the paper because I do not have a trip to the media.
SETimes: How do you think the problems that have led to insufficient level of EU funds?
Do you think it was wrong?
Orban: We have been in charge of the management of EU funds, and we have made an important assessment, including the authorities.
We have decided to take a series of measures aimed at improving the benefit rate.
Various sources and challenges -- insufficient administrative capacity and a lack of certain experience in this area.
The state institutions are aware of the differences and better performance of state structures, the previous funds that Romania joined the EU are managing pre-accession funds.
Others face major challenges in the direction of these funds.
At the same time, we were preparing the projects of the reformist entities and then identified the challenges facing.
These challenges include more complex procedures from normal.
In addition, there are challenges about the participation of the private sector, such as the banking sector.
However, I am clear: If I have to speak with diplomatic language, we are facing specific unions in the system.
SETimes: How do you have any statistics on the Hillary projects?
Orban: We are not happy, but there are such incidents.
The fight against corruption agency has a clear vision on projects or projects under investigation.
However, even if they do, the number is not important.
SETimes: However, what is the census decrease?
We do not have a really coastal coastal coastal, because we have the risk of such incidents.
In public bureau, the European Commission has had problems with the system.
Therefore, we have changed this system.
SETimes: What is the main measures of the Public procurement system and are the main measures that have been taken to tackle?
Orban: The legal changes in the tender are under way, and the changes in the system are under way.
The second consists of two state structures in charge of public procurement mechanisms.
This means that the two institutions will be responsible.
So far, no one has been responsible for their decisions.
They participated in the system, and they must be able to make them responsible for these institutions if they are seen.
For the first half of the next half of next year, we repeatedly reminded the risk of suspension of EU funds for six months.
Therefore, we are the main priority to reform the public procurement system.
SETimes: What are your main targets for your post?
In order to benefit from EU funds, I have been targeted as a target of at least 20% of the use rate by 2013.
This means that 3.1 billion euros are now affected by the end of 2012.
This figure is compared to 716m euros, which has been spent so far.
SETimes: Some environmental surveys in the EU argue that the countries that have not failed to withdraw a key part of the funds forecast from the 2013 EU budget should get less than the 2014-2020 budget.
Orban: Yes, this is a search used by member states who want to reduce their share in the EU budget.
Do you think that much money has been given to Romania, Bulgaria and other countries?
We will have to submit two arms against it.
First, if we need to improve the benefit rate and improve the internal situation, they are the most needs to be the EU in poor countries.
The EU is in the interest of the EU to reduce differences among more developed countries.
If I do not happen, the EU cannot move forward.
SETimes: Do you think Romania could be better solving the economic crisis?
Orban: No?
I see Poland, which protects the high level of EU funds.
They acknowledged that economic growth is high.
And they do not invest only in infrastructure, but they invest in projects that have created economic growth.
Of course, infrastructure is essential for a country such as Romania.
This is a precondition.
We need to invest in the fields of development, which has most of the economy.
SETimes: Roma see the EU funds very complex and bureaucracy.
How do you think the projects and the project are to tackle election criteria?
Orban: It is not easy to attract these funds.
We have to deal with many challenges that are difficult to overcome complicated procedures and eliminate.
In this field, however, I realised that at least in the road infrastructure, improvement and quickly development perspective.
The procedures needed by European regulations are completely complicated.
However, we have made it more complicated than these procedures.
One of the preliminary candidates is to press them and we analyse it.
We are also undermining, because we need to be more flexible.
The first requirement is to implement a greater fiscal management.
Therefore, we will not simply simply simply simply simply to jeopardise this type of fiscal management or not to reduce the situation.
SETimes: A debate on the new administrative arrangement of Romania is under way.
One of the vehicles in this measure is that the EU funds will provide better benefits.
Orban: We reviewed the lack of a systematic approach of different province guests with one of the projects.
In addition, even in the same province, we are aware of a connection between the projects that have been provided.
Another major public enterprises could lead to a systematic approach to the creation of the zones, and could help facilitate these priorities that can be financed with EU funds.
Because of the discrimination, a cancer pipeline project took place after a highway construction project, which must be destroyed by a new road.
More than one of the most different interests -- they have more visas and option, and such as an agreement cannot be reached.
As a result, we can withdraw the financing of projects that have not been implemented at the time.
Serbia pre-election pre-IMF inspection
The IMF was the first textile in the precautionary stand-by arrangement.
However, the main question is that the ruling coalition is not responding: What will the parties' financial resources?

The IMF mission, headed by Mark Alandson, who visited the country this month, was part of the precautionary stand-by arrangement of 1.2 billion euros, which discussed Serbia on 29 October.
Everything has been beautiful.
The agreement is defined and Serbia &aposs banking system is stable.
With the leader of the National Bank of Serbia and a good capital between the banks in the pre-crisis period, inflation is under control of public spending.
The IMF District has left Belgrade for confidence that the Serbian budget will be reduced by a low level of 4.5% of GDP, which is determined for 2012.
Serbia is satisfied with the ratification of a higher deficit, which was set only three months ago to be approved by 3.9%.
This is "ratified" of 25m euros to the fragile economy of Serbia.
Therefore, Serbian Central Bank of Serbia (NBS) Deputy Director Ana Gligorijevic said that this money would be used only if internal economy is instability, but Serbia will have the first loan in December 190m euros.
According to NBS analysts, Serbia is now in such a situation.
The inflation has dropped since May and has dropped to 8.7% in October, compared to 14.7% year-on-year period in April.
The Central Bank hopes that the planned 4.5% target for 2011 will be held in the first quarter of 2012.
The problem is still depends on two cities: the success of agriculture facility and the low electricity, natural gas, fundamental services and main food products, which control the state direct or inevitable roads.
The current inflation trend is encouraging.
This trend allows the NBS to reduce its main policy rates since the beginning of last year (2.5 per cent).
On the other hand, industrial production does not leave many of the optimism.
All of the World market -- at least, the sector is being discovered by extremist pressure, due to the decline in the EU, which Serbia has exported most of its products.
The economic growth of this year is limited with 2%, but it is expected to decrease to 1.5% next year.
"The decrease of imports is decreased, and this means that the crisis in the production field would mean a deepening," Vladimir Vukcevic, director of the same economy tennis Hungarian Anrosis and Trade (MAT), told SETimes.
"There is no optimism, industrial growth will take place at 1%," he said.
Another major concern is that US Steel will close the second explosion in Smederevo.
The first opportunity was in six months.
The company, the largest exporter in Serbia, is responsible for about 16.5% of Serbia &aposs total exports in the first nine months of this year.
In a country where unemployment is over 22%, there are 5,300 workers per company.
Alkalin, a IMF mission mission from Belgrade, noted that public spending will be likely to affect politicians due to the approach parliamentary elections.
The government said it plans to improve tax evasion, gain profit from public enterprises and increase the weapons on public purchases.
However, the success will be almost impossible to continue external debt.
"The current 7.25% interest in the state bonds is extremely expensive for a country where GDP growth is 1.5%," economist Miroslav Protojevic told SETimes. "Spain and Italy -- at 1.6% and Italy -- are not just a long term for the next EU countries."
Papandreou said Israel will help develop business relations with the EU.
ATINA, Greece -- Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Thursday (February 10th) that Israel will help develop economic relations and co-operation with EU member states.
"This will be crucial for the Israeli economy, not only for the Israeli economy, but also for strategic security," Papandreou said after meeting with representatives of the Conservative US Jewish community in Athens.
Greece wants to co-operate with Israel in tourism and defence sectors, he said. (Nafatherine, Eleftherapia - 10 / 02 / 11)
World Bank warns effect of the population living
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have warned on Wednesday that their countries of the Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union must reform the long-term economic impact of the population.

The World Bank warned on Wednesday (June 20th) that economic growth in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union countries could stop if governments do not take steps from the challenges that the regional population is accelerated.
The Bank said in a new report, titled "Women": First European and former Soviet Union ", many of the 28 countries in the region will be among the highest population in the world by 2025.
About 300 pages said the total population of the region in the next year is expected to decrease by almost 24m euros.
At the same time, the number of people in 65 will be higher than in 2000.
The nine countries, including Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), will be over 65 by 2025.
At the same time, both reasons for the decrease of the population and live, the eastern cheaper has so far been unprecedented and increasing average wages.
Bulgaria is the second country in Ukraine, which is expected to decrease by 18% in the next 20 years, when it is expected to lose 24% of the current population. The population of Romania is likely to be reduced by 2025, or 10% of Croatia.
In the region, only eight countries, including Albania, Macedonia and Turkey, will increase in the next 20 years.
In BiH, the rate of women in 65 is expected to rise at almost two times by 2025.
More than five Bulgarian countries will have 65, and Slovenia will be one of the most influential population in the world, the report said.
The governments of many Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union will have to reduce pension expenditures in order to meet the rise in the population.
Another outcome is that people in this group will have to increase health spending to meet the demands of patients, hospitals and gymnastics.
Apart from the fast life of the region, the report said, the poor population and the golden market economies are facing the problem.
"The more rich and more developed countries, such as France, Italy and Japan, are better than the Eastern Europe and the former Soviet countries in order to meet the challenges of life," World Bank for Human Rights Director Arup Banerology said.
According to Bank experts, the best way to balance pressure to create pension costs is to increase the pension rate in the region, especially in Albania, Romania, Serbia and Turkey.
Another proposal is to change social assistance rates.
"There is no increase in public spending, but the couple is possible to fall.
For this, the number of countries in the region must reveal policies that will be sustainable, even if the number of pension systems is increasingly increased, and take preliminary measures to finance long-term climate, "he said.
Although countries in the region want to continue fast growth and meet the standards of living, a strong production will be essential, the report said.
These targets could be achieved with reforms that will bring the financial markets to expand financial markets and make better education and to improve the labour markets through promoting life and spread of innovation.

In a move aimed at boosting the capacity of the Macedonian state, the government will receive 2,000 people from 2010 to 2010.
The plan, which is part of a key document in relations with the EU, was part of the National Investment Programme (UMUP), has sparked criticism for the Union 'governance and Euro-Atlantic standards.
The UMUP has been a task of how a country will be harmonised with the European legislation, the process and institutions, nor how many people will be spent, and will be taken into jobs.
The implementation of the UMUP will cost the government about 210m euros.
The plan envisions the work of about 2,000 people to work in order to make significant areas of administration in line with EU recommendations.
In the next three years, judicial and fundamental rights sector, justice, freedom and security sector, the environmental sector and rural development sector will still be worked within the plan.
The Information Technology will also include new employees in food security and regional policy sectors.
However, the public is worried that the move is more extraordinary to the public administration, which has been criticised for more irregularities and inefficient.
Finance Minister Trajko Slavevski, however, says there will be no new increase in unhappy figures due to the pension of 900-1,000 people annually.
In particular, the sector, which is working on European membership, has been set up to the criteria for failing to exercise public administration.
Experts will be made to work on each chapter of the EU legislation.
The purchase plan will also reduce unemployment rates.
According to official statistics, the unemployment rate of around 37% in the country is an important problem among the young professionals who have the university diplomacy.
Experts believe the UMUP will increase its prospects, because young and education will be taken.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks to the council on Wednesday (April 13th). [Reuters]
On Wednesday (April 13th), Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected charges that the government has restricted freedom of expression.
Erdogan argued that the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has removed restrictions in this area as part of democratic reforms, which has been implemented since it came to power in 2002.
"In the past eight years, we have given the biggest priority in the fight against any law, and we have also strengthened the most important rights and freedom as possible," the prime minister said in a Strasbourg organisation.
"The pressure on media over the past period has not reflected the truth of restrictions or laws.
I have to say that I have to say, there are some media agencies who written reports about the regulation of some ancient democratic forms, especially in the newspapers and mafia for eight years ago, are continuing freedom. "
The recent investigation, which has been charged with Ergenekon, a secret criminal network charged with the government, has also been detained, Erdogan said, noting that none of them have not been arrested for their professional activities.
"We are aware that some recent arrests have been taken as intervention in Europe," the Turkish leader told PACE lawmakers.
In this consensus, I would like to remind the coups and reminded journalist and newspapers who are not in Europe, "he said.
Erdogan also invited the Council of Europe to send representatives to Turkey to assess media freedom.
"We hope that European and European institutions will continue to spread the developments on this issue by certain environmental reports, but not more unbiased resources, and that the situation will be assessed," he said.
After talks with Erdogan, Council of Europe Secretary-General Thorbjorn Jagland said he accepted the invitation and would send a envoy to Turkey "as soon as possible" to assess the situation.
"This constructive approach is a step forward in discussions on media freedom in Turkey," said the head of the 47 countries' rights organisation.
Among the arrests in March, the newspaper Ahmet Sahin, who was detained on suspicion of the Ergenekon connection with Ergenekon.
Police organised the office of the house, which is planning to broadcast the book of the Swedish Army.
Following a move by the Istanbul court, police stated all draft the book of Sapin.
Nevertheless, a book was released on the Internet.
"I am not the person who was convinced the book," Erdogan said on Wednesday.

After the UN Security Council accepted the proposal for a peacekeeping force under the European commander in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the new force has announced its readiness to work together with SFOR &aposs commander.
"This is a number of work between NATO, the EU and BiH authorities," SFOR commander Brigadier General Steven P. Schook said at a joint press conference with EUFOR commander Major General David Leakey on Tuesday.
"After the motion and ideas were sent from Brussels, we will work together on the best way to make it," Schook said.
SFOR commander said the union will complete its mission on December 2nd, after meeting its mandate for security and labour in BiH.
NATO will remain unchanged without change of its long-term political determination in BiH, Schook said, noting that a decision to be established under the commander would be a permanent military presence in the country.
The NATO headquarters in Sarajevo will continue to support BiH defence reform and will take other support, including the fight against terrorism activities and assistance for war crimes wanted by the UN tribunal in The Hague, Schook said.
The inauguration ceremony of the NATO Convention in Sarajevo will be held on December 2nd, when EUFOR opened the Camp Butmir base.
More than 500,000 soldiers from 43 countries have taken over the past eight years in the long-term peacekeeping mission in NATO.
EUFOR will be the same as SFOR, but will also include the EU political role, aid programmes and ongoing police and monitoring missions to help BiH move forward on its path to Europe.
The EU force will also be headed by High Representative Paddy Ashdown, the top international community in the country, which is currently holding the EU Special Representative to BiH.
Ashdown will also be transferred to the Office of the High Representative in the EU.
Leakey said EUFOR would provide 7,000 soldiers and power from 33 countries, including 22 member states.
"The national contributions here are completely convicted of EUFOR and optimism," Leakey said. "All operations that EUFOR will here have been convicted.
The Berlin Plus agreement allows EUFOR to cope things such as communication and telecommunications structure and architecture, architecture and architecture.
We share intelligence because NATO has a full intelligence bank and facilities here.
In addition, we also share some contracts for the basic support that NATO has already been formed.
Both Schook and Leakey stressed that the main responsibility for the arrest of war crimes indictees is BiH officials.
However, Leakey said, EUFOR will continue its intensive search to connect NATO headquarters.

He is a member of the centre-right National Movement Party.
However, the deputy head of the National Security Commission, Memet Yelvacoglu, said the administration is on the right path, despite criticism.

As a Muslim regional leader and a Western alliance, Ankara is a strong skept to fight terrorism, he added.

The fourth round of negotiations in Belgrade and Pristina on Thursday (May 4th) will begin on Thursday (May 4th).
The agenda of this round is the Kosovo Mitrovica issue, which has been divided among ethnic communities, and has been on the issue of documentary Mitrovica, which has been dealing with clashes for years.
As for other important problems on the agenda of the status talks, the two sides have their positions on the future of Mitrovica.
The Pristina delegation will defend the establishment of two municipalities in Kosovo, which will be responsible for the establishment of an international manager in the coming years.
Serbian negotiators are willing to be completely separately two separate municipalities, as the proposed Serb municipal group that would include close relations with northern Mitrovica.
The Kosovo side opposes this approach, as an initiative to the province by creating ethnic enclaves.
Participants described the previous round of negotiations as sincerely and constructive.
Nevertheless, the parties have not been able to extend different views on Kosovo.
The deputy UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari, who headed the talks, described the stalemate as "excellent".
According to Rohan, Serbs predict a great autonomy and central government for municipalities, while Albanians want a stronger role in the central government.
The decentralisation should be applied for all municipalities and should be based on ethnicity, Rohan said, while Serbs insist on implementation of all municipalities where a ethnic Serb majority is a majority.

Kosovo has been under UN administration since mid-1999, when Serb pressure on separate ethnic Albanians on NATO ended with a air operation by NATO.
Although Kosovo is part of Serbia, the final status has not yet been set.
In April, the Contact Group said the status issue should be resolved by the end of this year and that a solution should be accepted by all citizens.

"We can say that the Greeks do not respond to enough response -- this is that" he said.
In July 1995, an unit of 370 UN soldiers, which was ordered to flee shelter weapons, was given to the UN to protect Srebrenica, a "safe region" declared by the UN.

"Our international community, which does not allow us to be in front of our full observers," Straw said. "I am convinced that, I am afraid.
And it is very happy for this. "
Among other international officials participating in the treasury ceremony Monday, UN war crimes tribunal chief Theodor Meron was former US diplomat Richard Prosper and former US diplomat Richard Holbrooke, who was mediated in the Dayton Peace Accord, which ended the war in BiH.
In 1995, Meron called for the arrest and surrender of the massacre architecture, said the crimes committed were not only murder.
"These were targeted by a certain human group to destroy them.
So far, they are the best of them: genocide, "he said.
He added that if Karadzic and Mladic are not arrested, the court will not be able to facilitate justice in the region and complete a compromise.
Sulejman Tihic, a Muslim member of the BiH tripartite presidency, called for the arrest and punishment of ICTY indictees indicted for genocide of the Srebrenica massacre.
"It is the only thing that we can do so, the losses and killings are in an extraordinary way, and to make our efforts to punish those responsible for this crimes.
In addition, the list of war crimes indicted Karadzic and Mladic, "he said.

Fatos Nano, leader of the ruling Socialist Party (SP), who refused to adopt the truth, plans to appeal to the consequences in the 30 electoral code.
Given the vote in 97 of the 100-seat electoral zone, the DP won 55 seats in parliament.
The SP won it with 40 seats, while former Prime Minister Ilir Meta 'Socialist Movement of Socialist Movement won former Prime Minister Ilir Meta, an independent candidate.
According to Albanian law, 2.5 per cent of the remaining 40-seats will be distributed by the parties that have overwhelmingly overwhelmingly disbursed the vote in the country.
According to the DP and allies' ideas, the additional seats won the system are said to have a majority of at least 73 seats, allowing the government to form.
The SP and allies will receive a total of 64 seats.
The elections are seen as a serious test of the country &aposs prospects to organise free and fair elections in accordance with international democracy standards. Since the 1990 communism, the five-vote in Albania showed a stage of elections, violence and intimidation.
More than 400 international election observers to monitor the elections, the OSCE said that "international commitments and democratic election standards" are only part of the recent elections ".
EU security chief Javier Solana urged authorities to launch an official investigation over irregularities.
The CEC said it must investigate 230 complaints from parties and independent candidates before the final results were announced.
As a result, Berisha could decrease the number of seats and weaken power in the 140-member parliament.
"There is no result of the Socialists' authority or winner, but I will accept the election courts and the Central Election Commission as possible," Nano said Sunday.
The government of Nano will continue to ask the country until the election results are documented.
Without Srebrenica Rights in Serbia
After ten years after the army, Serbs are still uncertain about the Srebrenica massacre.

The attempts to respect the victims were also taken by threats.

"We are convinced with this crime.
We have to show the message between citizens and war crimes.
"The future of Serbia depends on this," he said. [AFP]
In the 10th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, the worst massacre in Europe since World War II is still uncertain.
Many questioned the ideas by TV teams should be autonomy, but that is all sides involved in the conflict, and everyone must express conscience from any other.
Some, however, tried to reduce the importance of Srebrenica, citing other incidents where Serbs were killed.
Several people, mostly those who live, have produced a lot of products.
"They should be free from us," he said.
The media or two divided.
Some TV channels such as B92 and Studio B were transferred on Monday, while Serbian national television did not do so.
However, all channels gave the first half of the news programmes.
The papers cited a visit by Serbian President Boris Tadic to Potocari, as well as on the events in Srebrenica in July 1995, and broadcast the rebels.
The Serbian Parliament convicted the victims of Srebrenica, Bratunac and Skelane, as well as the explosions in London last week.
But representatives of the ruling coalition were only in parliament.
The Democratic and Radical parties were except because they were not given an action to lawmakers.
A new political withdrawal could be a experience.
The most open message came from Tadic to the Potocari loss.
In the previous speech, Tadic said his visit was to present the respects of the victims.
"We are stopping this war crimes.
We need to demonstrate the message between the citizens of war crimes and the future of Serbia. Another reason for the region is the need for full confidence and co-operation among the countries in the region.
Several war crimes against the Serbian people have been charged, and the justice is expected to prove.
However, we have to condemn war crimes committed against another ultranationalised war crimes against us, "he said.
Currently, the two incidents have revealed a division of war crimes in Serbia.
On Sunday, 100 people from the "Women" organisation stood to organise a ceremony in Belgrade for the Srebrenica victims.
However, the threats have found a group of young people who attacked the threats and attacking the liver.
In Novi Sad, meanwhile, the organising team of the Exit Festival plans to published a peacekeeping message Sunday night.
Annie Lennox "will be given a message after ten years," Prosecutor The World Today "said." I have promised that our children, Srebrenica, Bratunac, Vukovar, Oluja, Djakica, Staro Gacko, Staro.
"However, in the last minute, local police have decided to leave this part after warning the threat of the bombing threat.

Romania ratified a new law on the National Investment Agency (ANI), a state agency, which is authorised to control the assets of politicians and other visitors, and has taken a step towards meeting EU justice standards.
The country targeted criticism of judicial reforms in a report by the EU in July.
"I can be seen as a positive house," ANI Secretary-General Horia Panescu told SETimes after the vote last week. "I believe the latest EC report on the judiciary has created a great impact on the votes of the votes."
The ANI was paramilitaries after a decision by the constitutional court in April and cancelled some parts of the previous law, which has cancelled the functioning of the agency.
As a result, more than 4,000 cases were suspended.
While Brussels entered unrest, Brussels called on Romania to move and proceed the law.
"Parliament was aware of the importance of the consequences that this report will lead to the political security of the public, as well as the external consequences affecting Romania 'interests," he said on 24 August. On 24 August, parliament adopted the new law with 78-0 votes.
The Social Democratic Party, however, preferred to attract optimistic.
According to party leader Victor Roberta, the revised law does not solve problems with the law.
"We will be optimistic in the vote until the Romanian government and the European Commission &ap91; demands] and the Constitutional Court [comes to a bill that is in line with the decisions of the Constitutional Court," he said.
PSD policemen attended the parliamentary session to ensure enough majority votes.
The new law is also on a number of cases that have been removed before.
These include the establishment of an investigation committee to the Contact Court and the establishment of a single presence that includes the accounts and property sectors.
The law also envisions the requirement to reveal any contracts with state authorities.
The presence is clear that I will be able to find a lot.
Furthermore, the new law gives authorities to investigate the ANI over the next three years.
The bill is now going to President Traian Basescu.
"The most important winner is still open and the expenses are still open, and the Romanian president is an extraordinary medicine in the fight against the conflicts of the public purchases, which enjoys a transparent transparency of state financing contracts," he said.
ANI expects the law to be appealed, he added.
Those such as the earlier court decision have been frozen, they will restore some of them to bribery.
"All these investigations must be closed," he said. "The two years of work was sparked.
Many investigations will be registered because it is limited to three years. "

American football football is slow in Serbia, and the new European Future Federation (EFAF) has proved it.
The EFAF was the first time a Serbian team, Kragujevac Wild Boars, on the list of the Best in Europe.
The American football football is unilateral in Serbia.

Following the end of the year, Wild Boars attended the first meeting of the American Futoglu Federation of Serbia and won Serbia ’ s first national championship in 2004.
Since then, Wild Boars won the championship of seven national champions.
Club secretary-General Vladimir Gajic told SETimes that nor one of the team was formed for personal winners to win one or two polls.
"It will remain the last stage of the club and sports, as a result of the actual interest in this athlete and our governance," Gajic said.
Wild Boars helps the development of the players in early years, helping them learn to learn their playing a radical football player.
The young teams are the first team, and the first team played ten young players in the first ten team this year.
Aleksandar "Alff", the top player of the first team, is Ristic.
According to him, the team of American football must improve the physical and heritage performance of every actor.
"We are aware of this principle, so we are the best," Ristic said. In the 2009 season, Ristic won more than 1,000 in the 11 matches.
Manny Diazz, one of the three Americans in the tender, told SETimes that Ristic has deserved its share in the winning of this year.
"Of course, all the players have met.
It is the team 'team and spirit, a real athlete, "he said.
He appears confident that the team will continue its success.
"Nemanja Calija told SETimes," There is no need to stay in a place, which means any stalemate, "President Nemanja Calija told SETimes.
He acknowledges, however, that Wild Boars expects various challenges.
"We have to find a constant voting stage, even after the five national championship wins," he said.
Kuland EFAF wants new US players and gallery to win the poll.
Kragujevac, a host of Wild Boars, supported the team since the beginning of Belgrade -- 120km south of Belgrade.
First, Kragujevac Mayor Veroljub Stevanovic pledged to continue support the club 'financial and logistics and build two new stones.
"The club is working on the bureau, and they [have] asked them to recognise itself through excellent performances," Jovan Pavlovic, deputy director of Stevanovic, told SETimes.
Kragujevac was chosen to host a preliminary tournament for the European Youth Championship in Spain next year and 23 August.
The Serbian team defeated Great Britania 13-12, the Netherlands 28-15, and will play a key precondition in Paris.

According to the prosecution, Boskovski has a commander of command, while Tarculovski has a conviction of convictions, planning, destruction, and abuse of aid and punishment.
The prosecution used "unprecedented", he said, claiming that the defendants had not operated any of the crimes.
The defendants are Macedonian citizens, who are charged with violating the court ’ s tradition of war.
Defence lawyers claim that prosecutors did not prove that the detention was responsibility in the case.
Boskovski ’ s legal representative, Edina Rasidovic, said the former interior ministry is not a evidence that he is under attack or is direct influence on military soldiers in Ljuboten.

Balkan countries welcomed the outcome of the parliamentary elections, which the United States and the EU welcomed on Monday (May 12th) in Serbia, when the Democratic Party (DS), led by President Boris Tadic.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic stressed that the victory of a "European Serbia" coalition against nationalist forces is unhappy for the future of the entire region.
"The outcome of the elections shows that we will have a neighbouring country, which is not focused on the past," Mesic said.
Other Balkan countries, including Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo, have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly celebrated Mesic 'remarks, celebrating the most important elections since President Slobodan Milosevic' regime took over the October 2000 democratic forces.
He was a surprise surprise in Sunday &aposs pro-European coalition, because the pre-election survey showed that the coalition is the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), in the survey.
The state electoral commission said on Monday that a European Serbia won 38.4% of the votes and that 250 seats in the country &aposs parliament will receive 102 of the 250 seats.
The SRS, with 29.36% of the vote and 77 seats.
The Western governments and senior EU officials, who are satisfied with the power of Tadic, praised Serbian voters for their support for European integration.
"The Serbian voters are doing what they are in Europe," the US embassy in Belgrade said on Monday.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn participated in high-level diplomats at the 27-nation bloc in celebrating the success of Tadic, signaling that Brussels is ready to support further progress in the accession process.
"The European Commission welcomes the success of the reforms that share European values," Rehn said. "The EU is ready to speed up the country &aposs EU route, including granting candidate status." He and other EU officials have called for a meeting of a new cabinet.
"I hope that a new government will be formed soon, in order to implement the reforms and to meet the conditions for continuing progress towards Europe," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Monday.
However, the coalition of Tadic has not allowed the SRS to provide a majority of 126 seats, and both seek coalition partners.
The fourth edition of the elections -- 7.6% of the vote, and the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), led by the Milosevic Milosevic, will be seen as a party, which will be postponed.
The coalition between Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and the New Serbia Democratic Party of Serbia, which won 30 seats in parliament, has said it is ready to join a coalition government in the SRS leader.
The SRS leader met on Monday to form a joint cabinet with Kostunica.
The two parties will have a 127 seat majority with SPS seats.
Observers acknowledge a coalition between Tadic and Kostunica, as the majority of the dispute between Kostunica and Kostunica on the country ’ s EU membership bid is deeply unimpossible, due to the deepening of Kosovo independence.
Therefore, the president will need some of the Socialists and some of the ethnic coalition to ensure the majority of parliament. Cedomir Jovanovic, who won 13.24% and 13 seats in parliament, agrees that the pro-Western Liberal Democratic Party is against the SPS.
Bank of Greece Says Economic Relations
The Greek government faces financial challenges, the possibility of violating the EU and the strike of public sector employees.
Meanwhile, elections are approaching.
By George Anagnostopoulos for Southeast European Times in Athens - 25 / 11 / 03
In a letter to National Bank of Greece Governor Nicholas Garch, Prime Minister Costas Simitis expressed concern about Olympic spending, the growing budget deficit and new social aid commitments, warning that Greece &aposs next government will have a huge building.
According to Garganas, the budget deficit will not allow public debt to delay and will slow the inflation rate, which has declined competitiveness.
The inflation of inflation, which was 3.6 per cent in 2003, will be 1.5 per cent higher than the Eurozone average, he noted.
In the first eight months of this year, the financial deficit in the public sector reached 5.5 per cent of GDP, estimated 150 billion.
GDP deficit was 2.6 per cent of GDP last year, and the figure is expected to increase more than two times.
The government 'deficit has increased from 1.9 per cent to 4.6 per cent last year.
Economy and finance ministries are at the same level.
The increase in the public has shown a lot of things for citizens, but the deficit shows that Greece is a step forward in the financial administration.
With Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis' rejection of the strike, including school teachers, university professor, police officers and nurses, financial concerns, the government also fear the greatest cheaper from the EU.
The upcoming elections are not applied for the ruling PASOK party, but the financial crisis has come at a time when all staff in the public sector are seeking more and more social assistance.
In the public polls, PASOK is at least 5 per cent of the opposition, Christodoulakis is now entering a solution to the financial problem.
However, the ministry has no chance to choose more votes, if the deficit will not be allowed to increase growth.
The reason for the reinformist of the fraud and the opposition party is the reason for the interest of New Democracy.
Opposition economic spokesman George Alogoskoufis has criticised the government 'efforts to sell the Post Savings Bank for sale, saying the process is not transparent.
Alogoskoufis is also charging that the 2004 budget, submitted to parliament on October 6th, is not safe.
Because of the budget deficit is set by Maastricht Pakdi, the government could be able to take an official sanction from the EU, due to the failure to limit the 3 per cent of GDP.
Greece may have already won a little time, because the Eurostat unexplosive explosion has been discovered and Germany and France are not part of these actions.
Do you think there is no economic growth?
Of course, we say that economic growth is complete with political stability.
According to former Romanian Finance Minister and economist Daniel Daianu, this is not always to do.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 06 / 11 / 06
In one of the demonstrations in Budapest city in October, Hungary showed an interim rhetoric model, as well as police who have been under control.
Political scandals in countries that join the EU have been surprised by many observers. [Getty Images]
The latest developments in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland are concerned by observers in the world.
Nevertheless, after internal politics joined the EU?
In the post-accession process, the government and coalition parties that do not comply with one of the democratic politics, are being part of the government and coalition, which are not complicated with the unit. In Hungary, these political tensions are caused to be sparked in public opinion.
Following developments, many are surprised.
However, these countries are part of the dynamic part of Europe, and the annual economic growth in many countries in the EU is higher than the time (1-2 per cent).
In countries where economic growth rates are high, economic growth rate has a greater chance of social stability and security in the country, the overall chances of politics and the economy.
In addition to the move, the majority of the population has made concrete economic growth over the past decade, and the ruling coalition must be supported by concrete economic growth.
At the same time, the foundations of the young liberal democracy are expected to strengthen.
There is a more effective effect that must be taken.
The citizens of the former communist countries, including Portugal and Spain (Portugal) in many EU-15 countries, have lived in the power economy.
Therefore, these people will be expected to find better facilities for democracy and cheaper populist rhetoric rhetoric in the scandal, or in the left cancer.
The two days of democratic life is thought to be more active in countries who have been convicted over the past years.
The relationship between the basic elements of economic growth and prosperity of democracy is a debate between economists.
Authorities argue that growth has come before all, even if serious diversification among the parties in the society.
Others say sustainable economic growth should not deepen social competensation and that the public property should be produced at a sufficient level.
Both the public sector and positive practices in the private sector, as well as an effective fight against corruption.
In the post-communist Mitteleuropa (Central Europe), high growth rates are not enough for a free social and political life.
Most of the citizens in Central and Eastern Europe can be said to be said to be in their countries where they are in the economic competition or not benefit from the second plan, and that the disappointment of citizens live, the disappointment of the disappointment parties that live and lost political bases.
Economists continue to discuss good relations between democracy and prosperity. [Getty Images]
With the support of EU membership, it is possible to say that the force is more effectively affected in the period that the countries hope to join the bloc.
This hopefully, politicians who have different ideologies have ordered the citizens' return to Europe ".
Most of the citizens "returned", meanwhile, has meanwhile, an unhappy society that will begin the economic benefits.
Now people have not been a simple improvement in any issue since May 2004, even though they see that efforts to comply with EU regulations have made additional challenges.
The move was inevitable.
This is even more frequent because of the "economic patriotic" in the EU 'main members, the economic patriography was classified with panic pulations that the EU has been implemented on candidate countries.
Eastern European countries have repeatedly monitored many markets in the EU -- including the intelligence and functioning of the Union -- for example, financing services and public services.
Eastern European countries have been more liberalised in these sectors, according to Western European countries.
As the EU seems to do with its heavy psychologists, some political circumstances in Central Europe are not power to predict the disappointment of some political circles.
Therefore, the economic nationalism in the West has caused economic nationalism.
Poland is also on other issues, such as Germany and Russia, who are working in the energy field, a very sensitive issue.
People are not beneficial for political freedom and are disappointed.
However, the life is very easy to forget these freedom.
The young people who have no personal experience on the communist era cannot know how it is.
They are aware of the referendum points, and some young people in the West are the news, such as the second world war and Nazians' Jews.
The truth democracy in the books is aware of the real democracy.
The announcement is democracy, executive and the good function of the judiciary forces.
The real situation of the Democracy is that political leaders are in line with their values and responsibility, which could be celebrated in some conditions.
According to some, there is a democracy problem in EU member countries, and there is no actual political and real state businessman.
"What is" no "in the new Europe is not only a couple, and that is not only a few psychological barricades, and that means such a reflection in the psychological churches or the groups.
The overall level of interest in Eastern European countries is a lot of EU members.
In addition to the other Western European countries, they are facing structural problems such as the lives of the population, the prosperity system, ID cards and rising pressure.
A bigger economic growth is not a huge medicine.
Although the governments do not show the capacity to deal with the social problems in the world, the government cannot be blocked with high economic growth rates.
There is no way to solve these problems, and politicians are awaiting a serious test in the coming years.
The steps will affect their internal policy and the economy.
Moreover, those in Central Europe are also a warning for the Balkans.
In Southeast European countries, all prospects and disappointments are the transition of the liberal economy from communism.
Due to economic problems such as unemployment in the region, the EU has become an extraordinary violation for some countries in the region, due to "enlargement materials" and other obstacles.
Observers in these countries have led to instability in Central Europe, but there is no need to make their decisions on their route.

Macedonian voters have elected the fourth presidents since their country 'declaration of independence in 1991.
According to results, 97% of the votes were supported by the ruling VMRO-DPMNE coalition, Ivanov won 437,000 votes, supported by the ruling VMRO-DPMNE coalition, while SDSM candidate Ljubomir Frckovski and the same professor Ivanov, who voted the book in the school.
The first results of the local elections showed that the VMRO-DPMNE won the mayoral mayoral (31st) in the second round.
The SDSM and two independent candidates supported the mayors, while the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) found eight municipalities.
The opposition Albanian Democratic Party (DPA) won the key Tetovo city.
The city won the mayor of Skopje, VMRO-DPMNE.
The victory of mayors in major cities, such as Ohrid, Centar, District and Struga, was only dozens of votes.
In his victory, Reuters quoted Ivanov as saying his main priorities would be resolved by NATO and EU membership and "the name dispute with Greece".
The party leader and Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, who thanked President Branko Crvenkovski for their co-operation "despite disagreements that ended his mandate", said his strong support for the VMRO-DPMNE "came from the victory, as well as the creation of a obligation against all public."
The VMRO-DPMNE congratulated voters because they participate in democratic and peaceful elections, and stressed that they are very important for NATO and EU membership.
Frckovski congratulated the winners, while SDSM leader Zoran Zaev stressed that the VMRO-DPMNE is no longer happy, but also with it.
The SDSM praised the upcoming elections, particularly the VMRO-DPMNE.
Earlier the delay, however, the party has taken a lack of justice: problems on the electoral list, inefficiency and citizens' voter votes are inappropriate.
The 43% turnout was the lowest rate of the presidential elections in Macedonia.
International observers from the OSCE / ODIHR have expressed dissatisfaction for the elections, but are still awaiting full reports from all over the country.

A official from the ruling coalition member of the ethnic Albanian party, DUI, said the party supports Ivanov, but that the vote is owned by voters.
Some experts said the lack of support of ethnic Albanians would be a serious obstacle for Ivanov.
Lajcak announced measures to strengthen BiH institutions
The top international envoy in Bosnia and Herzegovina announced on Friday that the process will bring the state more jobs.
(Office of the High Representative, DPA - 19 / 10 / 07; Fena, Office of the High Representative - 18 / 10 / 07)
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak [OHR]
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said on Friday (October 19th) that Bosnia and Herzegovina "has taken a series of measures aimed at installing the system" in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and to boost the functionality of the country &aposs institutions.
Addressing the measures as the first step towards this goal, Lajcak called for amendments to the BiH Council of Ministers' Council of Ministers and the state parliament 'Law on the functioning of both assembly, as well as measures to bring co-ordination with the ruling coalition.
If Bosnian politicians do not implement the proposed amendments by December 1st, the High Representative said, they have no other vehicles to impose them and impose sanctions against them.
The proposed measures aim to facilitate the mechanism of a decision in the government and parliament and to eliminate obstacles facing the laws.
The government will allow the government to take decisions even if some members want to block a specific decision in the past, they would select their way to join the meeting, which has not been applied to participate in the past.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is very clear that it does not function.
"The goal of the international community is to change it -- a normal state," the country said. "The goal of the international community is to change it.
We have not been completed without changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, stable, European, democratic, multiethnic society. "
The best way to achieve this goal is to be European integration, but Bosnian politicians are cautioning that the country cannot reach an agreement on police reform, which the EU cannot agree on this path, he said.
"Last Thursday [politicians] showed that they are not ready and clear that they will not move on the path to Europe and will not be able to move forward," Lajcak said. "All sides of the European principles have been agreed that they do not have a solution to a solution within the framework of European principles.
In addition, despite the prominent and volunteers that they have made a database, it is not possible nor half of the necessary agreement today, "he said.
The EU extended Bosnian politicians to reach an agreement on police reform by October 15th, as the 27-nation bloc can sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the end of this year.
Following the leaders' failure to fulfil this requirement, the key agreement adopted as the first step towards eventual EU membership could be postponed at least a year.
"However, it is not difficult to move forward on the path to Europe -- that is ready for European integration," Lajcak said. "Although local politicians are awaiting for European integration and are waiting, it will be closed until local politicians decide to impose a road."
However, the international community has to work towards strengthening the Balkan country, as well as its responsibility for its own language, it must be a new approach to turn it into a stable, modern and democratic country.
"The work of Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions is obvious because the agreements do not do and resolve solutions.
They are not given the laws, "Lajcak said, noting that only three reform laws have been passed within the past 12 months.
Only one witness was interested in EU membership.
"I think that the current situation is questioning what we will go to the EU, not the people who will go to the EU," the chief international envoy said. "Today the measures do not eliminate the rights or responsibilities."
"It is the only people who believe that this country could undermine its functioning," he said.

(Zaman - 13 / 02 / 08; BBC, Turkish Press, Bianet, Reporting Journalists - 12 / 02 / 08)

Turkish authorities criticised Turkish authorities on Tuesday (February 12th) for failing to respond to demands that all involved in the plan would lead to a full investigation into justice, in which Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was involved.
Following the start of the trial against 19 people indicted for the murder of the weekly Agos newspaper and editor-in-chief of the Turkish and Armenian newspaper in Istanbul, observers began more doubt that the truth will be revealed.
"We repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly urge the Judiciary system to do its mandate in this case," the Paris media monitoring organisation said on Tuesday. "We are regret that the conditions are not necessary to be revealed."
In these conditions, we doubt that the judges will continue to determine the responsibility and crimes of different leaders. "
Dink, 53, was killed in front of the daily newspaper on January 19th 2007.
In July 2006, six months in prison sentences were sentenced to six months after the World War II indicted "genocide" of about 1.5 million Armenians as "genocide".
Oday Samardzon, the main suspect of the trial, was the radical nationalist, who was born in the Black Sea city of Trabbzon, has repeatedly appealed to the murder, and also showed him on the Armenian issue.
Among other defendants, Erhan Tuncel, one of the Law on Hayal and a police officer.
Following the murder, media reported that police have lost more violations on the murder, but did not take action to prevent it.
The lawyers of the Dink family have repeatedly claimed that the events have been discovered and authorities refused to launch an investigation over the country &aposs security forces' fears in the plan.
"The document, which includes information about more than 6,000 telephone consultations that some of the defendants are doing, cannot be made in a difficult way because police officials in Trabzon are not displaced," said lawyer Erdal Dogan.
The trial was attended by the Dutch member of the European Parliament and the head of the Turkish-EU National Assembly, Joost Lagendoski, who attended the hearing.
He criticised the Turkish government for failing to fulfil a dozen investigation to reveal all people about the incident.
"Police officers and security services have nothing to do so, but some of them have taken part in the plan," he told the BBC. "
All these points should be addressed in this case, or there is a lot of widespread willingness to the image of Turkey, "he said.
Judiciary efficiency and judicial independence challenges for Macedonia
For Macedonia to fulfil the requirements for EU and NATO membership, the country must be deeper and serious interest in reforms in the judicial system.
By Goran Trajkov for Southeast European Times in Skopje -- 13 / 02 / 08
EU and NATO membership depends on judicial reform. [SE Times]
Judicial reform is one of the main challenges Macedonia must be taken to NATO and EU membership efforts.
Furthermore, two channels of the problem are the efficiency of courts and the independence of the judiciary.
In Macedonia, the most proceedings in the other chapter are under way by ten years, at least ten years.
According to the constitution, meanwhile, the judges are likely to have direct political influence on elected by parliament.
"The state Judiciary Council members must be provided by the judges who are elected by the judges," said Renata Suppka, a lawyer.
"The political parties in parliament must be aware of this process because of the European integration aspirations, not only because of the European integration prospects, but because of the Macedonian citizens' dependent judges and inefficient political processes every day," he said. "Political parties must be able to reconciliate the interests of the public and make a greater consensus for
The education of people working in the Judiciary system is a key factor.
As the country is on its path to membership, the judiciary will serve as a mandate for European and international law enforcement.
New organised crime judges will be called for building a more efficient system.
In order to achieve that, it must be enough education.
According to experts at the courts, reforms will be very deep.
The amendments in the Constitutional judiciary will also increase funds and authority, and will be implemented in implementing "constitutional complaints" as the last post in the defence of people in court.
Experts say reforms will need to be done before.
The door for Macedonia to join the EU is open, but it could not be clear.

Bulgaria has declined media freedom in the country since Bulgaria joined the EU in January 2007, a international media monitoring organisation said in a report on Thursday (February 5th).
"Organised crime groups … increase their rights on the media," said Regional Journalists (SG) in Paris.
Bulgaria ranked 59th among the 173 countries in the latest annual press freedom of expression of the group, with the highest level of EU member states.
Since 2006, the country has dropped 24 pages since 2006.
The SG prepared a 14-page new report on the country &aposs base on the basis of media in 2008, following a number of radical immunity.
In April, Many Stoev, an expert in organised crime, was killed in Sofia.
Addressing the Frog News website in September, Ognan Stefanov, director of the Frog News website, stood in three days.
The same month, the State National Security Agency (DANS) found a number of lawmakers and journalists' telephones.
According to the SG, corruption and news manipulation showed that corruption and news manipulation has removed from violence through the first half of the 1990s, but Stoev and Stefanov are still at large.
"Some journalists have to stop themselves, while others continue to resist pressure from business and political circumstances," the media monitoring organisation said.
The organisation added that Stoev murder and Stefanov, "the regret task of the risks" for those who are doing such pressure ".
In addition, the SG says, a 1998 law that banned members of the country ’ s National Security Agency in the communist era to be implemented in executive positions in the media.
The group also found that the official Bulgarian Journalists have a little authority, and journalists remain part of a major paper of the communication law.
For instance, some conservatives are doing to accept "business sculptures" because the journalist does not respect more respect or not a winner.
According to the group, the country journalists live in two levels of press freedom, and their colleagues in Sofia have more liberalisation, while strong figures are not tolerated to the top journalism with local officials.
Asen Yordanov, a gas journalist, told Yordanov SG that the situation has gone in the past 15 years.
According to Yordanov, the most sensitive issue is high-level corruption on top officials in the judiciary or interior ministry.
"However, the number of issues [such issues] are growing in the new controversial society," Yordanov, who was based on Team and physical attacks.
The European parliamentary elections in June will test Bulgarian authorities' commitment to ensure their jobs, the group said.
Gazprom balanced euro for weakness Serbian dynamic
Russian Gazprom supports the Serbian economy of 400m euros and supports Serbia 'difficult currency.
However, most optimistic experts see the effect.
By Georgi Mitev-Shanik for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 09 / 02 / 09
After Gazprom announced the announcement, the dynamic has increased. [File]
The Serbian dynamic was an increase in the euro after Russian Gazprom announced that Serbia will pay 400m euros in a 51% stake in the national oil company (NIS). As of Friday (February 6th), 92 dynamics were equalised, while all of the lowest levels of 9.3 euros on January 28th.
In Serbia, nobody expects Russia to restore its power in the first day of 2009, which was considered in the first day of 2009, and the 1 per cent of the euro is 8.6.
Experts expect the decline to be 24% in the eurozone since 1 October -- the largest two months since October.
The Turkish port, the second fastest monetary unit in the region, has dropped by 17% in the same period.
Serbian experts have been divided over the truth value.
The optimistic expects the euro to an exchange of between 90 and 95 per cent to 95 per cent, while the exports fears that the foreign currency exports could be low by 150 to 1 euros.
A fixed foreign currency board has created reality on Serbian people, companies and the government.
Serbia, such as other Southeast European countries, has also been dependent on importing imports, is high inflation.
Furthermore, inflation expectations are increasing prices of companies importing the materials.
The consumers who pay hotels and car loans through the euro need to win more cities.
In addition to the commitments, Serbia has no easy treatment of fundamental macroeconomic experiences.
The lack of foreign investments and the trade deficit of 8.2 billion euros in 2008 is creating the country ’ s current account deficit.
The Serbian central bank is seeking to pay its foreign debt to the country.
Even though Gazprom has the euro, the bank does not have the assets needed to pay foreign debt and promote the dynamic.
The National Bank of Serbia (NBS), Serbia (NBS), sold 1.2 billion euros in 2008 to sold 420m euros so far, but it has no effect.
Moreover, the NBS lost another weapons of weapons to banks who buy valuable networks from the dynamic.
Darale fears, NBS reduced the rate, but has no longer the most frequent search for banks to sell the euro.
NBS Director Radovan Jelasic said the bank will not continue to defend the dynamic.
"These intervention, planned privatisation revenues of the government, which are responsibility for achieving, external investment or new loans from abroad," Jelasic said.
NBS warns that the dynamic decrease is a sign of the need for a serious deficit in the economy and that Belgrade has no money to spend the money.
The bank says the budget cuts, external investment conditions and export increase -- which means a rise in the quality of products -- and will attract inflation.

As of this month, EU citizens will have the same opportunities with Croatian nationals who are selling to sell property in Croatia.
Furthermore, EU citizens have to cover long-bureaucracy procedures and numerous legal conditions, such as the foreign and justice ministries to buy property for years.
Croatia, which took effect this month, has fulfilled a requirement for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement to recognise equal rights in the purchase of property in Croatia.
However, the new bill is not included cultural and national property under agricultural and protection.
Journalists outside the EU have to get a month to buy citizens from foreign and justice ministries.
Despite the beginning of the past few years, property prices and the global economic crisis have begun, observers are waiting for continuing exchange in sales for foreigners.
Experts found Croatia as a long-term house document and a long-term house.
In the past, a foreigner who wants to purchase special property must be allowed to be allowed from the two ministries in the food.
Although at least 98% of the incidents were allowed, the process was very slowly slowed, and the process was able to last two years.
Another problem was a clear name for the search, because the government is in the upcoming Sicilini only a few years.
Currently, this internet can be done.
According to the Croatian Economy Study, more than 3,500 foreign property have been allowed to buy more than 3,500 foreign property over the past decade.
In this area, Germany (2,000) has been leading, while the Austrians (700), Hungarians (120) and the growing number of numbers.
External buyers who flee them are preferred to Dalmatia and their name to Istria injury.
Although the official figures are not true, more than 70,000 foreign nationals have been invited in Croatia, and said they have been able to receive an extraordinary boycott of a foreign company or not a special allowance.
In an interview with the Zagreb Economy Institute, Marusa Vizek of the finance department said the foreign affairs had requested by 1,500 people annually, adding that foreign nationals would not change the price after the liberalisation prices "are expected to be made in accordance with the Croatian property market".

Marko Milosevic, believed to be hiding in Russia, was sentenced to six months in prison because his family had threatened the Otpor movement against the regime of Pograevac.
Earlier this month, however, Zoran Milovanovic withdrew a statement about the incident.
Several days later, all legal charges against the son of the former Yugoslav leader were restored.
The rest of Milovanovic came less than a letter that he wrote to Kostunica and Tadic and said his family had no longer been based on the threat of death threats.
On Friday, Tadic called on Republican Prosecutor Slobodan Jankovic to examine the withdrawal of the charges against him and to release a clear report on the public.
Jankovic returned to his summer holiday on Monday.
Nenad Konstantinovic, a member of the DC executive board, said Jankovic should respond to the questions of the party by Tuesday, and also said that justice minister and other officials on the case should be cleared.
Constantinovic said the party would ask the resignation of the prosecutor if it does not do so.
"Of course, it is not applied for Marko Milosevic and Mira Markovic, who applied for others," Belgrade Radio B92 quoted Konstantinovic as saying on Friday.
Local media say the goal of these developments is to facilitate a family meeting in The Hague, where Slobodan Milosevic is on trial.
Meanwhile, Serbian Service Investments Minister Velimir Ilic denied allegations that he intervened in the case.
Ilic said he recommended Milovanovic that the former Yugoslav president would "ask his son".
"I said Milovanovic." I have the arrest warrant.
In the past, they have been reluctant and seem to see the crowd, "he said.
Serbian Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic, a leading member of the ruling coalition, described the removal of charges against Marko Milosevic as a "extraordinary movement" and a blow to pro-democracy forces in Serbia.
He also said on Friday that Jankovic would like the party to ask the resignation of the prosecution, although he had intervened in the case.
G17 Plus will also require a meeting of the government coalition to discuss the issue.

Montenegro Approves Foreign Investment for 2005
Montenegrin Minister for European Integration Gordana Djurovic is pressing the government to prepare a plan that would give Montenegro to the FDI in 2005.

Montenegro wants to increase the Foreign Investment in 2005, after the disappointment figures achieved this year.
According to European Privatisation Minister Gordana Djurovic, the government hopes that privatisation campaign will be finalised with a 150m-euro FDI for green investments and other development projects, according to European Integration Minister Gordana Djurovic.
Djurovic said authorities would have to work very hard to promote Montenegro through the campaign and bilateral talks, which targeted potential investors in the global capital market due to difficult competitiveness.
For many international experts believe the FDI will begin in 2006 and 2007, the next year is considered very important.
This year, the Agency for Investment Support was established.
The agency is expected to start a key role in the upcoming privatisation of major enterprises such as the state telecom and alcohol factory.
FDI increasing production is an important factor in reducing unemployment, improving infrastructure and improving living standards.
Despite the ongoing privatisation process, Serbia-Montenegro and other Balkan countries such as Poland and and the Czech Republic have already attracted foreign capital -- officials have linked to the SEE countries' markets and transition processes.
International demonstrations show that Serbia-Montenegro has no significant investment rating.
Among the countries in the region, Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania are in the tense.
In response to the question, Podgorica holds foreign advisers to assess the possibilities of the general investment climate and business development.
A recent report by the Foreign Investment Administration Agency (DODD) in Montenegro "highlighted some challenges facing the FDI.
In addition to a low-income market and interim transition period, investments in the republic are also undermining the lack of structural weaknesses in industrial industries, macroeconomic instability and corruption.
However, DODD experts noted, however, that Montenegro has a good geographic consortium, rapid economic reforms, bankruptcy and rapid privatisation.
According to the DHR, the potential Montenegro has to be fully recognised by government activities.
Therefore, the government must prepare a clear strategy that will use this potential, according to Djurovic.

"The government has passed a few chapters in the last period of parliamentary procedure and even blocked some economic reforms part of international financial institutions," Kostov said.

Prosecutors in Republika Srpska (RS), the entity under the Serb control of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), have arrested eight people indicted for war crimes against Bosnian Muslims during the 1992-1995 conflict. Following the arrests Monday (November 15th), the entity has taken the first step towards arrest war crimes indictees.
However, none of the 21 fugitives wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) are not among the arrests.
Following the move by the Sarajevo canton court, RS special police forces Jovan Skobo, Svetko Novakovic, Momir Glisic, Goran Vasic, Zeljko Mitrovic, Veselin Cancar, Dragoje Radovanovic and Momir Skavac.
Two of them were charged with genocide, Skobo and Novakovic, while others have been charged with crimes against civilians and war crimes, according to the court official Slobodan Nikolic.
According to local media reports, the individuals were arrested in raids in RS special police forces, Pale, Lukavica and Foca.
He said that all eight indictees were transferred to the court in Sarajevo.
On Tuesday, local media suggested that the arrests will be held under a month.
According to Judge Mito Crnjak, the ICTY and the Sarajevo canton court have agreed to be tried as local.
The arrests came as a pressure by the international community to continue to extradite indictees, including RS officials, including Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander, Ratko Mladic.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown on the UN Security Council last week criticised RS authorities for their success on this issue.
Ashdown warned that the situation could jeopardise the chances of BiH to join the EU and NATO.
He welcomed the arrests Monday as a positive step, but stressed the discrimination between local and international claims.
"Although there are serious crimes allegedly committed by those indicted by those indicted by the Hague tribunal, the crimes suspects indicted by The Hague tribunal are hiding," the BiH daily Dnevni Avaz quoted Irena Gurelova as saying. "The RS authorities will be based on the evaluation of a final assessment of war crimes committed by The Hague authorities."
RS officials said on Monday that the arrests are a sign of their commitment to co-operation with the ICTY.
RS Interior Minister Darko Matijasevic promised additional steps to fulfil its obligations to the tribunal.
Meanwhile, the Council of Europe announced on Monday that all those indicted by the ICTY have decided to expand all financing and revenue resources, including Karadzic, Mladic and fugitive Croatian General Ante Gotovina.
Among the new figures, 17 ethnic Serbs, as well as Bosnian Croat Miroslav Bralo, who was transferred to The Hague after the recent surrender.
Public newspapers in BiH wrote on Tuesday that all indictees outside Bralo have banned their entry into the EU.
"We welcome the EU decision.
"We are awaiting a new step that will restrict the areas of movement and obstacles," he said. "We expect BiH authorities to keep the same as The Hague indictees to foster their assets."

The majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) citizens, which were disappointed by the 1992-1995 conflict and are disappointed by politicians that are spread by nationalist and corruption, are being monitored by the Berlin Wall.
"Some say the socialist Yugoslavia is destroyed with the Berlin Wall," Sarajevo legal professor Zdravko Grebo told SETimes.
The political reforms in 1965 have caused a wide market economy, which caused the borders to travel, Grebo said.
This system was removed by domestic pressure and tensions.
They have a strong social guarantee, intelligence and parallel quality education and health services.
"Yugoslavia is aware of other communist countries in Europe.
However, the disappointment of the Berlin Foundation has no positive difference. "
Children has changed Europe, but it was not seen as a major news agency in BiH.
"However, the new obstacles have started to convene soon after Rir Perta was discovered.
Sarajevo has been under way for more than three years. Today, BiH citizens still face visa liberalisation to travel in Europe, "he added.
He says he is difficult to say whether he is more freedom and rights from the former city today.
"There is no media and freedom of expression in Yugoslavia.
Now, there are a multiparty political system, judicial and media independence, but more guarantees for the majority of the public, economic, cultural and education.
The situation in human rights is a disaster. "

While no time is not a member of the communist party, Prlenda said, "one should have to have to be communist in order to be" deeper or politically politically ".
"We have much more criminal, corruption and unemployment in BiH today.
There is no reason that people are in the past. "
Hajdar Arifagic, 62, a journalist, says expectations on the fall of communism are not done in BiH.
Arifagic believes Yugoslavia would be the first Eastern European country to join the EU and NATO.
"There is no freedom of movement to travel abroad, we do not have a peaceful state and the most developed economy, but we do not have a policy [free], freedom, equality and broadcasting.
Each idea of the French state is that I do not see the global level, but the success in BiH, "he said.
"I feel that the Berlin Foundation was the last swimming star in BiH," he said. "I feel that the process has dropped in the swine of the entire car."

Greek leaders expressed satisfaction Tuesday (December 8th) with the EU foreign ministers' decision to postpone Macedonia 'date for membership talks.
Greek Alternal Foreign Minister Dimitris Drutsas said the name dispute between the two countries should be resolved.
"There is no way to start negotiations without a solution," Droutsas said, adding that Greece is ready to help the accession process when it comes to a solution to the ongoing problem.
In order to avoid a final coup from Greece, EU ministers decided to replace the issue in the first half of 2010, when Spain will take over the EU presidency.
Sweden, the head of the current presidency, presented a draft proposals for a starting date, but failed to reach a compromise on strong objections from Athens.
The Skopje decision was not delayed.

Gruevski stressed that open problems between the two countries will not be resolved with the consequences and obstacles.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki described the outcome of the EU meeting Tuesday as "a new cycle of Greece".

According to Eduard Kukan, a member of the European Parliament, the new Greek government has been elected by the electoral chance.
"If the new Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou cannot make progress in the administration, I do not know how we can solve the name issue," Kukan said.
Kukan, the head of the European Parliament &aposs delegation for relations with Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo, has warned Macedonians to foster nationalism.
He noted that the Gruevski government has a very powerful public support.
"This could be used in two aspects: the bottom that will be taken on the name issue, approval of procurement political decisions, or nationalism," Kukan said.
Last week, Gruevski met with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to discuss the situation.
Barroso said he believes the possibility of a real solution and that both countries should show political will in order to achieve it.
"EU membership is the most important goal of the country 'foreign policy with NATO membership," he said.
The latest direct talks with Papandreou were in a positive airport, but not concrete results, Gruevski said.
"There are dialogue … but we still have made serious progress [on the issue]," he said.

The Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) is expected to receive a decision on Tuesday (February 4th) to support the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) candidates in the parliamentary elections on Wednesday (February 4th).
The conservative DSS, the most conservative member of the four democracy parties that won seats in December 'elections, has already begun support from the Socialists, when the new government has been blocked since weeks.
Following talks with the DSS on Monday, the leaders of the "National interests", the SPS said the parties that indicted war crimes indictee Slobodan Milosevic, who are the official president of the conservative conservative deputies, would be the basis for parliamentary candidates.
However, a SPS official said the issue of talks is likely to be formed by DSS leader Vojislav Kostunica.
"We cannot support a political platform that opposes the values of the SPS represents," said Ivica Dacic, head of the party &aposs central committee.
According to SPS member Milorad Vucelic, the party will require a review of the privatisation process and to send Serbian citizens to The Hague.
Dejan Mihajlov, vice-president of the DSS, confirmed that the talks were made "and will be done more."
In addition, he said, four political forces involved in the democratic bloc will not continue with a coalition talks with the Democratic Party (DS) and the coalition.

The party was second in the elections after the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), headed by war crimes arrest Vojislav Seselj.
The Socialist Socialists of Milosevic have 22, SRS, 82 seats.
The ongoing coalition talks between the four parties in the Democratic bloc have failed, despite many experiences.
The DS, which plays the leader in the last government, is supporting Dragan Marsicanin of the DSS 'parliamentary candidate. On January 27th, the DS and SPS were not elected as the DS and the SPS did not participate in the vote.
The DS also opposed the government to propose a solution after the three other democracy parties began to work before the parliament began.

Police said the banks are one of the best places where they see their rating, but more than the orijinale is spread.
According to Central Bank Chairman Ljubisa Krgovic, however, the criminals would be difficult to do with the market in Montenegro, as well as millions of euros.
After a transition to the euro in 2002, Krgovic said the Central Bank has been trained to recognise the regional branches and banks' banks' rating.
At the time, only a ancient bank rating was discovered, but it was only two banned banks, not only one.
The truth Operation Operation Interpol, as well as co-operation with Bulgarian and Serbian police.
Police expert Marko Nicovic said the operation was the positive answers in the region and other countries in the police services.
He said Montenegro has been punishing criminal groups due to a major tourist and foreign entry.
As a result, it is important to co-operate with other police services in the region, as well as close co-operation with international police organisations such as FBI and Scotland, he added.
Police Director Veselin Veljovic praised the operation.
Veljovic said the end of the operation has shown that Montenegro is on track to have a modern police force.

Companies and friendly NATO members Greece and Turkey have made a new initiative to boost relations, even if disagreements on the Aegean issue remains a problem.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit Athens in mid-May to meet with Greek counterpart George Papandreou.
"We hope this will be a historic visit with a new visa-Greek relations … with a new vision in Turkish relations," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said.
Davutoglu and Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas recently announced the establishment of a high-level Turkish strategic co-operation council.
The council, proposed by Erdogan, includes foreign affairs, energy, the EU, transport, internal affairs, education, environmental and cultural ministries.
The two countries' presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers have also reached an agreement on the sidelines of international conference.
Meanwhile, change programmes for young diplomats will also be implemented.
Davutoglu said Turkey and Greece want to develop a new vision based on mutual interests, not on threats.
"If we have managed to build this common future, the defence requirements will also be eliminated," he said.
Analysts say such comments are proud, but implementation is difficult.
"These are convinced decisions," said Sami Kohen, an embassy on foreign policy. "However, two things are necessary to implement them: the political will, the first time is mutual trust."
Ankara and Athens have long long problems on the Aegean, including cars, air space and oil rights, the Ukrainian Information zones and sovereignty over their islands.
The countries arrived in 1987 and 1996 in the war, and the dangerous military incidents have been taken to boost confidence measures to prevent dangerous military incidents, but air and Mediterranean forces are still unregulated.
A senior military resources Hurriyet quoted a senior military funding as saying the chance to resolve the dispute is still weakened.
"The reality of a security reconciliation in the Aegean, when the current conditions are met," he said.
However, countries can make progress if they are focused on common shares.
Both countries, for instance, are under pressure on the continued military budget.
Greece needs a huge international aid package to save the economy, while the EU is urging the country to reduce defence spending.
In late March, German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested that two sides of regional opponents would end much money to spending.
According to the Stockholm International Research Institute, both Turkey and Greece have expended a total of 15 billion euros in 2008 -- 8.7 billion euros and 7.2 billion euros, respectively.
Greek initiatives feel crisis
Local factories, victims and markets have more than a rescue package for Greece, local factories and markets said.

At a time when a debt crisis that has frozen the country, it is both a partner and emergency: Ne, if you have to do and do so?
The situation is very difficult.
"We see that a historic period of historical withdrawal is not always, but we see the biggest problem," Yiannis Paretzoglou, a woman in western Athens, told SETimes. "We are not the biggest problem."
The comments of Paretzoglou arrived on April 27th, covering Standard and Poor '' '' rating on Greek bonds' status, 'Kara' said.
We will also present a record interest rate between Greece and German counterpart bonds of a decade of annual bonds and the reduction of the Athens Stock Exchange by 6%.
"The fact is that something is that one will go to a certain audience," Paretzoglou said. "It is a concrete prevention."
In the first three months of 2010, he said, about 20% decreased in revenues of the factory in the first three months of 2010.
The decline in a disease skills in the north of Athens has been accounted for more than 25% since the beginning of the year.
Vangelis Katsiadakis, a medical manager, asked Papandreou to do what his government wants to tackle the situation.
"The businessmen do not think the measures are taken, but it is important that the measures are taken.
"The situation has not been affected by consumption," Katsiakis said. "It is a great unemployment.
If the IMF has been taken, it is not important, it is not important that they are, but in two months, "he said.
Katsiakis said the clients -- primarily companies and owners -- are still missing their jobs, while most of the operational costs, particularly the revival of commercial circumstances.
In addition to the prices, the VAT hikes -- will be able to get 23% as part of the proposed bailout plan -- have been ordered by businesses and not reflected to their clients.
Stefanos Lekatsas is a car of medium-medium-medium-medium-medium-medieval car and a territory in Athens, Patras and Agrinio, the west of several women.
Lekatsas said that something that the government and politicians need to avoid danger is to "avoid terrorism and panic".
"The exploration and investor safety is very important, but it is a death of death," Lekatsas told SETimes.
In the first three months of this year, he said, 2009 has managed to increase revenues from the same period, but it is able to decide on its goods and stock.
However, the increase of a 12% increase in revenue growth has been too much, while Paster has increased sales in the holiday resort on March.
"If the main effort is, the revenues are high," Lekatsas said.
He also warned that "victims in the areas" are not decreased.
Furthermore, the owners of small-smaller victims have already begun with a large rise.
However, due to the crisis, the Lekatsas has not been legal, but did not increase the polls.
Ian Gourley, head of the Greek Iranian Business Association, said that if any decisions were taken, the "inclusion" is not the need for an inclusion ".
Gourley, whose Greek exporters are tightening at least a measure that would affect direct and more effective, noted the implementation of a electronic customs monitoring system.
Apart from Greece and Poland on April 1st, Gourley said that every part in the EU has been transferred to the internet.
The IMF package for Romania two years ago has created spending on the economic fall, he said.
Gourley said the same should be used if it will help Greece.
"We have a positive atmosphere in Romania," Gourley said. "Co-operation has begun, and economic growth targets."
Albania Anti-Economy Relations
Albanian officials are taking part in a project aimed at reducing the transportation economy in the country and to prevent tax evasion.

As part of efforts to build a modern financial system in Albania, public employees, including police, will not be transferred. [AFP]
One of the obstacles to Albania 'economic growth was the presence of a major registration economy.
According to the IMF, this is the 50 per cent of economic activities in the country.
Albanian Central Bank officials, meanwhile, predict that 26 per cent of the money in Albania is above the banking system, but the number is still high than international standards in recent years.
"This is a result of the lack of information on the banking system between the public, and is linked to economic and financial crimes," said Bank Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Fatos Ibrahimi.
The government is seeking to reduce registered economic activities as part of efforts to build a more modern financial system.
One of these measures is to leave public employees as a transfer.
In June 2004, the National Bank of Arbaviation held a pilot project to disperse salaries through bank accounts.
Authorities are now planning to dissolve the wages of about 1,000 officers working in the state administration with the second hand.
These banks are participating in a intensive market process, which aims to include public system, reducing new vehicles, reducing commissions, ATM machinery and other services.
Many banks have already submitted the service of public services through bank accounts.
Under the new initiative of the government, clients will be able to pay telephone, electricity and water bills.
It is expected to create an important impact on the expensive system through the banking system.
Several research, conducted by BoA, shows that Albanian citizens who use bank accounts are still low.
However, this is likely to change the bank account for many people who are trying to receive their salaries as a transportation.
Fiat Without Fiat 'Exchange, Serbia' Tzech Authority Anti-Policy Anti-Corruption
Zastava, Serbia &aposs problem cars producer, received an exploration in August after Italian Fiat accepted 72.5 per cent of its debt.
Nevertheless, the future of the former Yugoslav sector leader is uncertain.

Serbian car producer Zastava is still difficult, despite the debt exchange rates. [File]
Since the coastal American project dropped by the end of the 1980s, Serbia 'car manufacturer Zastava, a leader of the time, has been discovered.
Although every election campaign has been taken on the agenda, the governments who have managed to rescue the firm debt and excessive labour costs.
In September, the municipal campaign was not different: only a few days before the elections, municipal candidate Zastava promised to spread its debt to the state.
However, the stagnosed car producer was formed one of the biggest debt in recent months.
In August, Italian Fiat adopted 72.5 per cent of the 41.5m-euro debt, an obstacle to a strategic partnership of the company, Kragujevac.
According to an agreement, drafted by the Paris Club of the countries that submitted to Serbia-Montenegro, Zastava has 12 months to pay 11.5m euros for the rest of the remaining 11.5m euros.
According to Serbian Economic Relations Minister Predrag Bubalo, who heads about two months of talks ahead of Fiat 'decision, the state will not guarantee another guarantee to Zastava.
"We will help it achieve resources that will sell some part of the company to sell and pay its debt in time," Bubalo said.
Is Serbia 'only passengers producer, and do you wait for more days?
It is difficult to say.
The exchange came more than two years after the government disbursed the Zastava Holding and disbursed all over 20 companies from the weapons.
Although the state has promised to end these distribution, Zastava continued to send a subsidiary of about 6.5m euros over the past three years.
Ahead of the agreement with Fiat, the value of company assets -- including car products -- state, local credit companies and employees -- were 20 per cent of the value of company assets.
The talks with the previous government plans for privatisation and the Peugege-Cnen Group have not been opposed to Toyota and Volkswagen, with Zastava to invest in order to sell and develop investments. In 2003, 4,500 vehicles produced to 500,000 vehicles have not been able to seek a model for a foreign producer Zastava to
However, such a huge government intervention is more necessary: especially in particular, a 240m euro loan for the planned repayment of eight years.
The blueprint plan, which has been submitted by the Zastava administration last month, has increased two times, and is essential for production of 40,000 cars in the first year.
In the first half of the year, the problem has managed to produce 5,500 of the 18,000 vehicles planned for 2004.
Nevertheless, the head of the assembly 'industrial committee, Veroljub Stevanovic, said the Zastava plan would be acquitted.
However, Serbia cannot remove a expensive balance so far.
US Defence Minister Says Romania 'Black Sea Together
Romanian officials gathered US Defence Minister Donald Rumsfeld to a military traffic tour in the Black Sea, where Pentagon can join plans to be more flexible.
The final decision is expected in 2005, US officials said.

US Defence Minister Donald Rumsfeld, who began his trip to Romania on Monday (September 11th), visited a air base in the Black Sea, where the US military is believed to be used by the US military.
While the decision has been given months, a team of US experts is likely to visit Romania in the coming months to discuss more details.
The wife of Defence Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu visited Mihail Kogalnnosanu air base near the Kystadium port.
He also tried a military facility, which will soon be discovered by a Romanian piane.
Kogalnnnnosanu served as a provisional conservation of 3,500 US military staff in the preparation of the move in Iraq in early 2003.
About 7,000 US soldiers were transferred to northern Iraq during the early period, with flights from the air base.
As the new reality, US President George W. Bush announced a change in US military policy earlier this year that the major permanent bases in Western Europe will be transferred to smaller education facilities and crisis areas.
As part of the plan, 70,000 American soldiers will be changed from Europe and Asia over the next ten years.
"The disaster of our new global attitude is to catch the crisis points of asylum," a US official said on Monday.
Speaking on the rise, a senior US defence official said Romania 'offer would be addressed with allegations, because Koggalnnnnosanu has now spent an additional 3m funding for modernisation of the air base.
"We can use it as an important education scene," the Washington Post quoted him as saying, adding that facilities in Bulgaria will create a strong US presence in Eastern Europe, which is likely to be united with two bases.
A official said that there is no major military unity for renewal of the US military presence in the neighbouring Romanian military base or the neighbouring Romanian military, but more soldiers should be subjected to their common education exercises.
Authorities from the US Defence and Foreign Affairs are expected to visit Romania and Bulgaria in November to visit what we want to really do ", a senior defence official told New York Times.
Another question about the possibility of the accord, "Pascu said." I hope that we will be.
However, this is not something that we do. "
Rumsfeld will meet with senior officials, including President Ion Iliescu and Prime Minister Adrian Nastase, before NATO defence ministers joined a two-day meeting in Romania.
Rumsfeld, who was a short visit to Macedonia before arriving in Romania, cautioned that the referendum on local governance laws recently adopted in NATO "on stability and economic growth" has found a clear vote between the future and a future, which would be able to return to the past.
In addition, he signed a co-operation agreement with Macedonia on preventing most of the weapons of arms.
Under the agreement, equipment and education will be provided to Skopje worth 258,000 values.

PACE wants to resolve issues in the Western Balkans
North Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are politically political areas in the Balkans.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times -- 14 / 10 / 11
As part of the decision, the PACE chairmanship committee is seeking "putting the dialogue process and eliminate the tension" in the region. [PACE]
The Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe (PACE) decided last week that North Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania need a solution to the political situation.
"The political stalemate in northern Kosovo on the security and free movement of persons and trade goods and free movement of the national government in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a serious concern among the main parties in Albania," Bjahn Sydow, a Swedish member of PACE, told SETimes.
As part of the October 7th decision, the incident, which took place at the Judiciary control point on the Serbian border with Serbia at the end of September, envisions a deep and unilateral investigation.
The decision said the problems in northern Kosovo are the way for e-Belgrade talks under the EU mediator.
In addition, the "dialogue process is offered to create a delegation in the committee of the PACE presidency for the" removal of tensions and elimination of the tension ".
The delegation "is increasingly politically politically and can work to take steps in accordance with European Council principles," said Von Sydow.
Ian Bancroft, a founder of Transflict, stressed that Northern Kosovo will protect as one of the fundamental issues and should be discussed as part of talks.
"If the problems in the north are resolved, the chance of achieving talks with Kosovo is very low," Bancroft told SETimes.
"It is crucial to the EU, because the talks can be successful," said Kosovo political analyst Seb Byci.
As Serbia is now in the EU candidate status, the EU could have a greater pressure in this context.
If Serbia wants to make progress in the talks with the EU, Serbia will remain really facing its messages that its obligations against the EU and the improvement of relations with Kosovo, "he said.
Another concern is the ongoing political stalemate in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"The stalemate is that foreign direct investments in the country have been reduced by the international financial institutions, which have dropped the country 'credit rating by 75 per cent since 2009, the unemployment rate is higher than 43 per cent of the population," the decision said.
According to Von Sydow, the solution of the problem is "that the rival forces discussed the situation," they do not block the country [more] than the international financial support, and not to stop the national economy at the point. "
Bancroft notes the deepening divisions within Bosnia and Herzegovina, noting that all of them have a chance to find a solution to the problems of the country.
"The Republic of Republika Srpska has refused to strengthen the government at the state level, eliminate the new ministries of ministries to be resolved, while it will not be able to solve the basic problems, and would lead to further deepening the current divisions."
"All the political parties in the country are encouraging their democratic functioning, work for the normalisation of the political situation in the country, and in parliament to initiate the political dialogue, which must be addressed and fulfilled the necessary political dialogue," PACE said, praising the outcome of the 2011 local elections.
However, analyst Young Mlloja says it is very difficult to make such progress.
"The two main political parties in the country [the ruling Democratic Party and the main opposition Socialist Party] have made any action, but they have made any action, despite their willingness to eliminate the degree," Mlloja told SETimes.
Hundreds of Hundreds of Hundreds Together Over former Bosnian Lids
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) President Alija Izetbegovic, who played a key role in the end of the war, joined about 150,000 people at the funeral ceremony in Sarajevo.

Hundreds of laws gathered in Sarajevo on Wednesday (October 22nd) to fulfil their latest duties against former Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) President Alija Izetbegovic, who died in the age of 78.
Izetbegovic will be repeatedly reminded as one of the signing of the Dayton Peace Accord, which ended the 1992-1995 war.
Izetbegovic was elected in the first post-war elections in 1996 to represent the Muslim community in the first quarter of the three-member presidency and was the first head of the authorities in 2000 because of the health problems, but was replaced in active politics.
"President Izetbegovic said," President Izetbegovic will remind the historic role of protecting Bosnia and Herzegovina and the establishment of the Bosniak state. "
"Izetbegovic was a very proud leader for the people," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said, adding that Izetbegovic "played an important role in the end of the war in his country, under the difficult conditions in the Balkans".
The death of doctors at the University of Sarajevo, Izetbegovic, said that the long-standing shelter has caused a comprehensive rhetoric in the recent house.
Police officials said the funeral ceremony in the BiH capital is expected to join foreign officials, including Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, as well as Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul.
A special trends and dozens of vehicles have been seized to transfer Sarajevo to Sarajevo, where BiH is a majority of Muslim population.
Police sources told Agence France Presse that there are expectations from Croatia and Slovenia to come to Muslim.
Izetbegovic will be discovered at the Kovaci House, where hundreds of Bosnian Muslim soldiers were killed during the 1992-1995 siege of Sarajevo.
The former president was in the BiH presidency at the hours of hundreds of hours, and he was injured in the wake of the building.
Organisers are planning a formal funeral minimum in the Sarajevo city centre, before the funeral community 'reputation of a funeral unearthed streets.
However, a two-day law was admitted to the Muslim Croat federation of BiH, while an official delegation representing Republika Srpska, the country ’ s entity, Republika Srpska.
Some Bosnian Serb officials, however, were expected to join the funeral ceremony.
Izetbegovic, the founder of a law and founder of the Muslim Party of Democratic Action, was elected president of the Yugoslav republic in 1990. In 1982, the book "Eastern and West" was named by the Slav West, which faces Muslims living in a country.
Yugoslav authorities sentenced Izetbegovic to five years in prison for defending "Pan-Islamic movement".

Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said on Tuesday (June 27th) that Serbia is ready to compromise on the future status of Kosovo, but would not accept a consensus based on the army.
"The stand-by consensus is not a consensus and Serbia cannot accept a compromise based on Serbia," Kostunica told reporters after talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The two leaders discussed various issues, including Kosovo and EU membership, as well as the 45 minutes of Serbian interior and economic ministries, as well as the head of the Kosovo Co-operation Centre, Arda Raskovic-Ilic.
Britain is a member of the six-nation Contact Group, including France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States, who played a key role in the process of determining the final status of Kosovo.
At the same time, Blair and Kosovo, Kostunica made it clear that his country seems to see "real autonomy" as the only possible solution.
He said this would be more autonomy than the province has any region in Europe, while Serbia will not change its borders and that the rights of the Kosovo Serb minorities will be protected.
While Kosovo is still part of Serbia, Kosovo has been under UN administration since the end of the 1998-1999 conflict.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanian officials have participated in direct talks on the province 'final status since February, but many progress has been made so far, and their positions are still major differences.
Kosovo Albanians, who account for about 90 per cent of the province &aposs population of 2 million people, want Kosovo to become fully independent from Serbia.
While the international community expects a solution by the end of this year, some widespread forces have announced support for the Kosovo Albanian majority independence.
The move, Kostunica said on Tuesday, has not been among the options, insisting that a move would destabilise the region.
The British daily Financial Times quoted Kostunica as saying that if such a solution is based on Serbia, it would "be rejected by the Serbian Parliament" and "would create an inevitable turmoil point in Serbia 'relations with the rest of the world."
Addressing the EU bid for Serbia, Blair reportedly urged Belgrade to speed up co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to move forward in the process.
In early May, the EU stopped Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with the country, after Belgrade fails to arrest and hand over former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to the UN tribunal in The Hague on 30 April.
Since then, Brussels has made it clear that the SAA talks, considered the first step on the road to eventual EU membership, would be sustainable.
Croatian Journalism Award for Journalism
SEEMO received the first prize last month: "Dr Erhard Busek-SEEMO" nor Croatian journalist Denis Latin "in Southeast Europe. [unfortunately], he could be difficult to be a journalist in the Balkans.
A journalist must always be a generation.
However, this is not an easy job if the ethnic conflicts do not comply with the discrimination of ethnic conflicts, or if politicians are doing their jobs or mafia residents.
By Let Bartet for Balkan Times - 18 / 11 / 02
A journalist in the Balkans may be difficult.
A journalist should always be a generation of integration and should not be able to see all of the incidents.
That is why you have been touching, in the past years, they are not an easy job if the conflicts of the conflicts, or the husband of politicians or politicians' vessels.
Thousands of journalists in the Balkans have to live and take part in the consequences of the generation statement.
Now a new organisation has decided to difference journalists' efforts by Southeast Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO).
Last month, SEEMO received the first award: "Dr Erhard Busek-SEEMO" in Southeast Europe. A jury of media professionals about 400 candidates has won this year as Croatian television adviser Denis Latin.
Latinica, a television programme drafted by Latin, announced on several controversial issues of the normalisation of refugees or normalisation of relations between Croats and Serbs.
"Serbian tourists should be dismissed in the Adriatic Charter of Croatia?" Latin said in one of the recent programmes.
The concert was doctors' house.
Serbs and Croats in the former Yugoslavia have seized their holidays, along with Croatian sites.
Both communities were proud of fruitless, insufficient circumstances and damage.
However, since the war in Croatia in 1991, many former Serb places have been able to restore resorts in this holiday resort.
Several times ago, Serbia was opened to the West and revealed as an option to the swimming swimming of Croatia in its cleaning buses.
This is not surprised, when the war was in the Dalmatian coastal coastal coastal.
Latin decided to reveal the issue.
Both sides of the Sddapest have made: dissatisfaction between Serbs and Croats, and the ultranationalists who do not want Serbs to take a step towards Croatian territory.
The tension between the two groups has always reached the point, nor everybody agrees on the time of reconciliation.
SEEMO secretary-General Oliver Vujovic said that Latin was affected by the willingness of the Croatian media to address issues that need to be a major part of the Croatian media.
However, Latin is only one of the many newspapers working to improve mutual understanding in the Balkans.
SEEMO has revealed over 400 candidates to give this award, saying "Bay Latin has been very working to reach a decision", adding that "Bay Latin was more beneficial for many other journalists who are nominated."
The new award, also supported by Southeast Europe Special Co-ordinator Erhard Busek, is only one of the events of SEEMO, which also includes journalists' legal framework of the climate in the event, and is also part of the credibility of the laws that will be in line with international standards in some of national governments.
The SEEMO has no problem to withdraw the public interest, but it is uncertain that the SEEMO has made a position or made it clear when it comes to a top media professionals in Southeast Europe. But it is not a diplomatic approach, if it is repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly, it is a diplomatic approach.
The SEEMO has made it clear that a political party created several months ago has decided to open a local Slav Macedonian television conference in Tetovo, Macedonia.
Vujovic was linked to the party &aposs leader, stressing the importance of the media meetings to be open.
The party leader did not respond to this approach: the party leader has promised that the decision to adopt the law would not be removed, and that was free from television.
SEEMO is also supporting journalists in danger of personal security.
"Journalists have changed problems facing the country, however, are the biggest problems in the region that we live in the region, with people who are linked to mafia and mafia," Vujovic said.
Police are not willing to journalists, and they are not reluctant to journalists. The Serbian female journalist Slavko Djurija was three years after the murder of his house, but they have not been unable.
The wages of journalists in the region do not have enough resources to make the integral research journalism of the media.
"Each journalist who is good [he] has to think that [his] will be repeatedly to respond to the written," Vujovic said. "It would affect the outcome of this."

Russian Gazprom is in the final phase of talks with joint countries in the South Stream pipeline, expected to be completed in 2015.
Among the forces, the public and political opposition have expressed concern about the effects of the partnership with Gazprom.
Serbia has great expectations on South Stream that South Stream can do.
The project promises Serbia to exercise natural gas fees.
Gazprom Vice-President Aleksandar Medvedev says Russia will guarantee 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas annually from the 47 billion cubic metres of natural gas from the pipeline expected to Serbia, while the disagreement between Russia and Ukraine is proud for the country, which has a lot of energy factors that live in the Balkans in 2009.
Serbian public opinion, however, has failed to announce that Srbijagas and Gazprom will initiate a second joint initiative to build a 400km part of the pipeline in Serbia.
Nevertheless, questions in the cafes, Switzerland, Switzerland, where the initiative could reach Serbian officials.
Experts and opposition leaders have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly that the second initiative will be in Switzerland, when it comes to the annual transition fees of 200m euros, the pipeline will not be built and question the current Russian joint initiative.
In recent months, the Russian delegation, who was in one of the post, visited Belgrade.
Meanwhile, the delegation also expressed their hope for the voice of Serbian energy co-operation, supporting Serbia ’ s stance on Kosovo.
Medivedev, a recent revision on the South Stream contract on March 28th, assured the Serbian people that a recent revision would mean "an increase of natural gas from our territory", the daily Vecernje Novosti said.
Nevertheless, the majority of Serbian citizens have not dismissed their resignation, but continued to believe that Belgrade 'Serbian public oil company NIS is sold to Gazprom for a very low price in the field of diplomatic support from Russia.
Last December, Gazprom 'company, Gazprom, bought NIS to invest 500m euros by 2012, with its obligation to invest 500m euros.
Experts noted the real value of the Serbian firm, together with two refineries and 400 gas stations, as well as other assets, as well as the real value of the Serbian firm.
As Moscow is in the position of the energy future of Serbia, the bilateral partnership is slow.
Following the NIS accepted its priority, the banks announced a financial report in 2008, suggesting 47m euros, instead of a 28m-euro profit.
The latest promising company on the issue will be KPMG.
In addition to scepticism of a close partnership with Russia, Serbs are now demanding a court in Belgrade to cancel public enterprises, as well as the previous NIS administration of the Serbian police service to the NIS 100m euros.
Gazpromnefti NIS also opposes the previous sale of a 6.6m-euro stake in Belgrade 'Hatt Retey.

Croatia won a seat at the UN Security Council in 2005 for last week, in the general vote.

President Stipe Mesic defeated Croatian relations with Africa and Asia countries and the former Yugoslavia, defeating their relationship with members of the unilateral movement.
The vote is "an extraordinary recognition of Croatia and his foreign policy", he said.
For the first time since Croatia won independence, Croatia has the opportunity to play an important role in the global decision.

"We will seek justice for all victims," Sanader said.
The prime minister, meanwhile, stressed that Croatia will not use its position to Slovenia to pressure the two countries' bilateral territorial claims in the Adriatic.

In addition, parliamentary sessions will be able to be prepared by at least 184 of the total 550 deputies.
"I see that the people participate in the referendum and expressed their preference on constitutional amendments and that we are very important for our country and democracy," President Abdullah Gul said on Sunday 'vote.
Following Ahmet Necdet Sezer in late August, Gul will be the last president elected by parliament.
Some experts, including the Turkish Election Council head Muammar Aydin, said the referendum results could have to regain Gul and that the current parliamentary mandate could be part of a year.
If Gul does not have a candidate, the task will continue five years.
After that, Turkish people will go to the polls to choose the next head of state.

Although the ideas should be negative, the ideas should be reflected, "he said." I do not know how the Constitutional Court will be possible to take this issue.
"We have to do that."

Teacher strike in Bulgaria
In Bulgaria, the teacher has been more than a month since the official start of the year, while teachers have been falling in most schools in the country due to the strike, which teachers continue to require a salary increase.
(Vidi Den, News.bg, Darik Radio, Focus News Agency - 23 / 10 / 07; Sofia News Agency, Sofia Echo, Dnevnik, Mediapool - 22 / 10 / 07; BIRN - 18 / 10 / 07)
Bulgarian teachers met last week in a national protest in Sofia. [Getty Images]
Following a member of the Grev committee condemning the latest agreement, teacher strike in Bulgaria was not high on Tuesday (October 23rd).
The government has tried to end economic pressure on teachers, Vidi Den, who wrote to the Internet on Monday on the proposed agreement, presented by Nikolay Nikolov education ministry, told the daily Vidi Den, who was broadcast to the Internet.
The strike continues and teachers will hold a new rally in Sofia on Thursday, Nikolov said.
Nine days after the school began an official official on September 15th, teachers strike in the country.
Studies are now demanding a 100% increase in their salaries, which are currently under the average of 200 euros per month.
In addition, the government also wants to represent 5% of GDP in the 2008 budget.
The government rejected the possibility of achieving this request, arguing that inflation would be stopped in August, arguing that a 13% fear was reached.
In addition, the long-delayed education needs to restore efficiency reforms and the recent decline in education.
Any move to increase teachers' salaries should also bring significant reduction in the sector, the government said.
At the end of the tension talks, unions said on Monday that teachers would accept a deal that envisions the entire sector 'average monthly salary, including staff staff from July 1st 2008 to reach about 325 euros.
The government 'latest agreement envisions an average of 325 euros for teachers in the second half of 2008 and only teachers.
On Tuesday, Nikolov said the government is trying to accept the previous proposal, which would increase its salaries by 10% in every season.
The two sides' failure to reach a consensus has caused more than a month, while many of them are concerned that they could not get the first half of the students.
The biggest school from the crisis will be affected by the end of the year, with 7th and 12th classes that are waiting to be affected.
While the opposition parties in parliament have declined a chance to find a bigger autonomy, opposition parties submitted a proposal last week against the government.
During a parliamentary meeting on Monday, the head of the centre-right Bulgarian Democrats for Democrats and former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov was responsible for the government of the strike.
"This is the biggest strike in Bulgaria and the teachers who acknowledge 13 of the 15 reform proposal that the cabinet has been proposed," Kostov said.
He criticised the overall approach of the tripartite coalition cabinet and the failure of Stanishev 'party to stop the salary rate before the elections.
As the government has a 168 seat majority of the 168 seat majority in Bulgaria &aposs 240 seats assembly, the cabinet is expected to be able to vote on Tuesday.
More than half of young people in Kosovo want to take
Kosovo is one of the most young population in Europe, and many of the population are below 25, and the number is growing.
Several young people are taking to other countries.

In addition to uncertainty about economic problems and the status issue, Kosovo faces another problem: the majority of the young population wants to go.
More than 50 per cent of the young people in Kosovo want to take to other countries, according to a UNDP report last month.
If the young people are thought to have more than half of the population, it is very serious.
The UNDP research – 800 Albanians, 200 Serbs and 200 of them -- are closing 1200 people between 15-29 and 29.
"The great part of the economic and social problems in Kosovo affects young people who live here, which is why the young population is not participating in the young population, and even even if they want to remain in Kosovo," said UNDP representative in Kosovo Frode Mauring.
Mauring says young people are very important for the future of Kosovo.
However, we are all defendant, poor and power, and there are no good models for the prevention.
The UNDP report is third of the reports on this issue.
The report focuses on the problems and opportunities for young people, the role of the Kosovo progress process, education, employment, social integration and a whole society.
The report is scheduled to be used by statistical databases such as poverty, unemployment, unemployment and immigration, and the authorities to increase the chance of a better life of young people, policy structures and development.
"The opportunities for young people and the opportunities for them are in terms of humanitarian development," Mauring said.
Young young people have revealed that many Kosovo young people feel that they are expecting them.
"The government is responsible for us to ensure a better future and a development perspective of young people," said Prime Minister Agim Ceku. [Getty Images]
"I do not know because there is no business opportunities," said Milaim Bilalli, 24, from Pristina to Southeast European Times.
According to Bilalli, your connections in the right places to find jobs in Kosovo are essential: "My teacher and some of them are not influential."
Lulzim Berisha, 25-year-old maximum scientific scientific scientists, says "I do you see the possibilities?"
I know my teacher as teacher, but I have always won 180 euros per month, and I can you do so with this salary? "
UNMIK institutions are more hopefully hopeful because they think they will find jobs in EU institutions that will be established in Kosovo in the future.
"UNMIK is taking place, but the EU is coming.
I think I can find a business, "he said.
"I will not be able to learn even if I can win more money since 1999," he said.
"I think that the OSCE mission in Kosovo will remain more safe, because the Kosovo Serbs are not ready for some other sectors that have shown democratisation process and the OSCE," he said.
However, everyone does not have a job in an international organisation.
The 27-year-old Mentor Gashi, who said he did not get the business, is a majority.
"If I [a business] this summer [, I will] experience the brother in Germany," Gashi told Southeast European Times.
The figures in the UNDP report have been concerned by political leaders, who are willing to impose the number of Kosovo Serbs who want to impose other countries at a time that the future of the region is determined.
Kosovo leaders are now trying to change the ideas of young people, to make the situation a long-term and hopes.
In addition to the UNDP report, Prime Minister Agim Ceku said "The government is responsible for us to provide a better future and a development perspective.
Youth employment, strengthening civil society organisations for young people, widespread education, participation in the society and integration of young people, education and education, "he said.
Kosovo leaders also say the chances of economic improvement will not be separate from the status issue, a political problem.
The major obstacles that can be resolved without resolving this issue will not be eliminated, the number of opportunities will continue to be insufficient, and the region will continue to live with a hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hours in the middle of Europe.
EC Anti-Terrorism
At a meeting with members of the Council of Europe (EC) and observers countries' justice ministers, EC Secretary-General Walter Schwimmer launched a joint initiative to create a joint legal platform to prevent terrorists, investigation and trial.
By Emil Tsenkov for Southeast European Times in Sofia - 21 / 10 / 03
The justice ministers, who met with 45 members of the Council of Europe (EC) and five observers in Sofia earlier this month, agreed that terrorism is a crime that must fight national borders and international consensus.
Speaking at a conference held on October 9th to October 9th, EC Secretary General Walter Schwimmer launched an initiative aimed at establishing a Capital Terrorism Convention.
The consortium "will provide a joint legal platform that will bring the obstacles to terrorism attacks, investigations and trial", Schwimmer said.
"The fight against Terrorism is unstopped, but the message of our message that the Council of Europe will continue to respect the values represented," Schwimmer said.
Schwimmer was also repeated by the European justice ministers, who stressed the importance of international co-operation.
Another point on the meeting was implemented by international standards on protecting witnesses and abuse of special investigations.
The ministers also supported the strengthening of the fight against terrorism victims and their families, as well as the fight against terrorism funding, which envisions a compensation for their families.
The ministers also reiterated the European Commission for the Administration of the Administration Team, which the national judiciary systems have responded to reactions.
The former Pan-European company, the EC, which was the most recent years to begin with the Convention of Terrorism in 1977, has been highlighted over the growing border threat of terrorism. In recent years, the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks repeatedly reiterated the importance of the global problem.
In order to assess the current vehicles and prepare a report on the organisations' activities in the fight against terrorism, the International Terrorism Conference was held at the International Anti-Terrorism Group.
The UN General Assembly praised the EC for its contribution to the implementation of terrorism and financing, as well as its contribution to the implementation of the 1373 Security Council resolution on the actions or declaration of crimes.

UN special envoy for Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari announced on Friday (February 2nd) that Belgrade has announced its status proposal. After the January 21st general elections, there is no government in the bridge of Serbia.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has denied that he is no longer the most important state issues, refusing to meet with Ahtisaari &aposs envoy in Belgrade.
Currently, Belgrade authorities' legitimate representative, President Boris Tadic.
Following the proposal, Tadic described the plan as a permanent way for Kosovo independence, which has been managed by the UN since 1999.
"No Serbia, nor we can accept the independence of Kosovo," Tadic said.
Belgrade analysts say the Kosovo issue will increase pressure on the establishment of a democratic Serbian government.
Tadic and Kostunica will have a coalition majority of the pro-Western G17 Plus, with the support of the pro-Western G17 Plus.
The parties, however, have not been able to reach an agreement on whether he will be headed to the prime minister.
Furthermore, Kostunica 'Democratic Party of Serbia (DPS) is essential for Kosovo to take part in any cabinet that will be formed.
The DPS has demanded that coalition partners would never recognise an independent Kosovo.
The relations between any country that recognised Serbia and Kosovo will be "inevitable", the party platform said.
Some analysts have interpreted the DPS move as a sign that the party is closer to the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS), which could have a majority of the parliamentary majority.
Radicals, however, have refused to form a government with Kostunica so far.
Meanwhile, the waste is on the rise.
The EU has been sent clear signals to the democratic government that will be formed to continue Stabilisation and Association talks with the EU.
The talks were stalled last May because Belgrade did not co-operate with The Hague tribunal.
Kosovo Serbs, meanwhile, have been under pressure on the parties in Belgrade to do their differences.
Representatives of Serb municipalities in Kosovo demanded the establishment of a government that would fight Kosovo 'potential independence.
During a meeting with the president on Monday, Parliament parties agreed on the willingness of a new parliamentary and a negotiating team that would stop a new parliament and more forced agreement.
Revenues in Croatia help election campaign
Both of the main political parties in Croatia are seeking to increase its chances this year with the aid of prominent campaign experts.

Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader is Irish P.J.J.
Mara is working with Mara.

Mara, the top political adviser to Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who has been elected for two times, is one of the most vulnerable campaign experts in the country.
Mara 'efforts have helped the HDZ won the final elections, and the party hopes it will not be able to do so.
The approach of Mara is focusing on personal personality, the party is based on the best way it is under the spot spot, and that is the best to benefit.
A clear message sent to voters: a person who is not fear of political comments, and a single target must be a permanent leader of democracy, which is on the interest of the country.
However, the HDZ competitiveness could decrease this time, because a prominent political campaign expert, the opposition decided to keep British David Evlic.
In 2001, the British Affairs Party was successful to the election campaign and established its own company in communication and political market in 2001.
Tony Blair has worked with a controversial political name and prominent political adviser, Alistpol Campchl, who helped win the elections two times.
The SDP hopes Evre will help them get a similar outcome.
In particular, the party is in particular, developing communications and relations with the people that would allow their messages to better broadcast.
More than 1,000 parties have been registered to participate in the education texts of Evre.
Now, the new skills are taking place and prepared to test the strategies of the HDZ opponents.
Everything has not yet been forecast, but the Croatian politics' reputation has changed.

In August, the Slovenian company Hit Montenegro has found 10,000 delays at the protel Maestral hotel Germany, Britain, Ireland, Italy, Slovenia and the United States, with many tourists.
Budva, a rich event, such as the flu festival and the international bottom festival, wants to keep tourists in the city after season, urging tourists to stay more than in the city.
This is an unprecedented situation for the river, which has been closed to the next season of hotels to prepare for the next season.

Only hotels and other official accommodation units can only be registered.
In addition, the effect of the tourist economic impact on the economy is increasingly likely to buy tourists.
Nevertheless, a joint meeting of tourism officials in Montenegro is a great progress in the tourism sector.

Youth and Education Terrorism Serbia "Tehdied
Unemployment, low salaries and opportunities are some of the factors that cause young people to leave Serbia.
Some organisations are trying to stop this image.

The number of young people who want to leave Serbia in recent years have been seen as a clear increase. [AFP]
According to the latest survey by the Centre for Employment Studies, young people in Serbia face a series of challenges, such as unemployment, low salaries, households, concern economic damage and career development.
These factors cause the immigration of the country.
In the past, about 300,000 young people left Serbia every year, including successful university students.
The figure showed a significant increase in 2003, while a survey between 16 and 35 young people were ready to leave the country, even though 43 per cent of them were the opportunity.
In order to slowly slowdown, university students have established the Best Studies Association of Serbia, which helps youth to assist.
Another organisation has chosen 73 people last year, while only two of them chose to leave the country.
The centre is planning to fulfil the students' hands in the main highway next year, selling a sold area on the highway, while successful revenues will be achieved.
Branislav Aleksic, a student of electricity engineering, says Serbia will not remain in the country without a better life.
"Children in all other countries have been seen since the beginning of the beginning, and any investment has been invested," Aleksic said, adding that Serbian citizens should not wait more than their countries.
Andjelka Zecevic, a maximum student in Benzer.
"I will have to go to go without full change," Zecevic said, although he was his city and friends.
According to prominent sculptor Srecko Muklovic, young people in Serbia are in a "limited youth" by delay, as the majority of the opportunity and encouraging point.
"The Society is leaving them with the minutes that they live," he said.
Another sculptor, Smiljka Tomanovic, is a comprehensive name on the situation of young people.
Tomanovic says independence of the parents, the basic condition for the revival, does not be achieved in Serbia.
As a result, young people have developed a postponement strategy, ensuring business in university work, thus do everything to do children.
Polls suggest that 77 per cent of the young men and women live with an expanded family, including their parents, are likely to become part of a expanded family structure.
Discussions on these issues have been blocked, Tomanovic said, adding that the recent survey would "drop from the ideological levels of power in society by the ideological levels of people and bring something to bridge for young people".

Albanian authorities are working on the reconstruction of the internal air transport network as part of a general strategy to encourage trade and tourism in the country.
In the northeastern city of Kukes, an internal airport is built with 13.6m euros from the United Arab Emirates.
The project will be completed by June.
The airport will be used for more goods.
Officials in the south, however, have been negotiating with several international companies on a possible intelligence agreement on construction of two airports, particularly for tourism in the Vlora and Saranda coastal city.
"We think the country is not enough to develop the economic development of economic development in these areas, but also as the possibility of accelerating domestic air transport," Albanian Transport Minister Sedak Poci said.
Currently, Rahia Teresa Airport in Tirana serves as the only airport of the country.
The expansion and modernisation of the facility over the next 20 years is expected.
In November 2004, Albania signed an inefficient agreement on the consortium of 82m euros, with a consortium of the US-German Tirana Airport.
The project, which continued for Mother Teresa Airport, is a good example of efforts to develop air transportation, Poci says.
Given the country &aposs poor road network, domestic airline transportation is very important for the country to make foreign investment more attractive.
Authorities say the establishment of the airport to Vlora and Saranda will open the way for construction and development of the planned facilities for Gjirotra, Corca and Shkodra.
In Albania, air traffic began in 1930. When Tirana, Vlora and Kucova arrived in 1944, Korca, Kukes, Gjirotra and Shkodra were working in Tirana.
At the time, the domestic air traffic has been operated by foreigners and foreigners, and about three mostly flights of the capacity to transport the most ten passengers.
During the communist era, internal flights were stopped outside military flights.
Today, Romano, Milano, Athens, Frankt, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Sofia and Istanbul are offering transport options to the rest of the world, including Istanbul.
According to Transport ministry data, the number of passengers increased by 13 per cent last year, while the number of passengers increased by 18 per cent.
EU Says Croatia &aposs Membership Talks
The EU foreign ministers called for Croatia to extradite fugitive General Ante Gotovina as soon as possible to the UN war crimes tribunal, reiterated on Monday that co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal remains a key condition for the accession process.

EU foreign ministers said fugitive General Ante Gotovina should be extradited to the UN war crimes tribunal as soon as possible. [AFP]
Following less than a month before the start of Croatia &aposs EU accession talks, Zagreb was under pressure Monday (February 21st) to prove full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and to extradite key war crimes indictee General Ante Gotovina.
"The Western Balkan countries continue to be one of the basic conditions for their progress towards full and unconditional co-operation with the ICTY," EU foreign ministers said in a statement after a hearing meeting in Brussels, adding that "the latest indictee must be brought to The Hague as soon as possible."
In December, EU leaders gave the green light for the start of accession talks with Croatia on 17 March, when it comes to full co-operation with the ICTY and extradited Gotovina.
Gotovina, one of the most wanted indictees of the tribunal, was disappeared in mid-2001, after UN prosecutors charged him with war crimes against the murder of at least 150 Krajinje Serbs in Croatia in the end of the 1991-1995 conflict and the murder of 150,000 others.
In a letter to the EU presidency last week, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said authorities "do not do everything from their own".
Del Ponte also accused authorities of falling the network that he described as "limited, health and effective".
As a result, Croatia cannot approve full co-operation with The Hague, he said.
Authorities in Brussels said that Croatia will welcome EU membership in December, but that the requirement for co-operation should be met.
"There is no surprise here, there is a precondition for the start of these talks," said Jean Asselborn, the foreign minister of Luxembourg, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Croatian authorities said they have accelerated efforts to capture the fugitive, but insist that no information has been proven that Gotovina is in the country.
"Our artefacts remain more intensified with the assistance of international experts.
I am convinced that we will find it, "he said.
"I am convinced that we have to show that we are in charge of transparency, and full respect in this case," Reuters quoted Croatian Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic as telling reporters in Brussels on Monday. "I am convinced that we will not do the EU."
The next rotating meeting of EU foreign ministers will take place on March 16th, when Brussels must decide on whether the talks with Croatia will begin and start next day.

As the first month of 2006, Albania is approaching a key milestone.
The European Commission (EC) said it is intended to complete its Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) talks with the country this autumn and open the way for eventual EU membership.
However, the commission added, the SAA agreement depends on progress in implementing the necessary reforms.
The SAA process of Albania has been more difficult than the other countries in the region, according to Sandender Minovic, director of the Tirana daily Gazeta Shqiptare.
"Albania is under way for three years of agreement talks, and talks are completed on technically," the American Storm told American. "However, there are problems related to internal political stability and electoral processes every year.
As a result, the EC has been linked to its response. "
Albania will organise local elections this year and the elections will be a test for the country ’ s ability to organise fair and free elections in line with international standards.
Political parties are expected to start talks on electoral reform, a more difficult problem in the past decade.
He said the previous elections were a poor rural: Each time, the process was organised, the political parties comprised to criticise political parties and change the election law.
"The latest local elections were held today, according to the rules package, which is unacceptable by many actors.
The vote depends on political parties' ability to find a joint language, but also the role of the international community.
I think that this role should be more important so far, "he said.
Another issue of the inspection is the fight against corruption.
In 2005, Prime Minister Sali Berisha has come to power with their commitments to the fight against corruption.
According to analyst Andi Busati, corruption must be really tackled, but the Berisha cabinet is not possible to do so.
"Corruption should be based on the political will of the authorities and the public have seen their results.
I think the government should not abuse this fight.
If the government wants to fight corruption, it cannot do so without other independent institutions, "he said.

Republika Srpska cabinet under pressure
Following a coalition member and the rest of the 2006 budget proposal, the Serbian Democratic Party has not been seeing in many parliament.

"After these results, I cannot expect the government to resign.
This would be an untrue movement for the future of the crisis, "he said. [AFP]
Dragan Cavic, the president of Bosnia and Herzegovina &aposs Serb entity, has lost parliamentary support, but instead of the government.
Cavic, who heads the ruling Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), also warned that his party would not be part of the new cabinet if the current cabinet is distributed.
The Republika Srpska (RS) government has not been sufficient since the end of the spring of the Democratic Progress Party (PDP), led by Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, decided to leave the ruling coalition and participate in opposition stages.
The SDS cabinet, led by the SDS, seems to have the power to stay in power after the 2006 budget proposal rejected.
Despite that, Prime Minister Pero Bukejlovic refused to resign, insisting that the budget stalemate is a result of the fight against corruption.
"After these results, the government cannot expect resignation.
This would be an untrue movement for the future of the crisis, "he said.
The 10th government has been selected by 11 months ago, when it has been in the post.
The cabinet is part of the SDS ministers, as well as individual representatives of Bosniak and Croatian communities.

Party leader Milorad Dodik said a move against the cabinet is close.
"We have a house to change the current government and I expect the new government to be elected by the end of this month," Dodik said.
Some analysts argue that the previous political crisis was created in a bid to create cards ahead of the election.

Macedonia celebrated the sixth anniversary of the Ohrid Framework Agreement this month. The agreement, signed on August 13th 2001, ended with the ongoing armed conflict in the country for months.
The agreement sparked constitutional amendments to the so-called Badinter First.
According to that, lawmakers who represent minority communities in order to accept certain laws must be approved.
A parliamentary commission, organised by the Committee for Relations of communities, was established.
Under the constitutional changes, the role of Ombudsman was expanded.
It is now the implementation of the implementation of the smaller ethnic communities and fair representation.
The most important outcome of the agreement, however, was the new territorial order law, which began a two-year decentralisation process.
Macedonia has made significant progress since 2001, US Ambassador Gillian Milovanovic said after the anniversary of the agreement.
"There is political stability in the Republic of Macedonia. In 2006, we organised fair and democratic elections, and any ethnic society can participate in democratic life in the country," Milovanovic said.
Professor Ljubomir Frckovski, who helped prepare the agreement, said the agreement was largely implemented.
"The radical zone law has been implemented.
This is the precondition of decentralisation, which is now implemented as successful.
The implementation of domestic and fair representation was successful, "he said.
Nevertheless, Vlado Popovski, who is in preparation for the agreement, believes about 70% of the conditions are implemented.
"The use of the discrimination has been implemented and the part of all communities outside the Roma community has taken major steps on fair cleaning.
The agreement will be fully implemented with the implementation of the general law on the use of the languages, "he said.
President Branko Crvenkovski organised an official tour last year with the fifth anniversary of the agreement.
Still, only the largest ethnic Albanian party, the Democratic Union for Integration, organised official celebrations this year.
The president announced that Macedonia plans to hold a comprehensive meeting to discuss the direction of the Ohrid Agreement since the signing of the Ohrid Agreement.
The meeting will be held on August 30th as part of a series of debate on the future of Macedonia.

The presidential election process, which is expected to win the candidate of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), is under way, while Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that the country &aposs military would remain outside politics.
"All institutions must be accomplished in accordance with them," Erdogan said in an interview published on Monday (August 20th) in an interview with the Turkish Canadian D late Monday (August 20th). "If we believe the constitution should not be involved in politics.
For us, the armed forces are celebrating.
In the democracy, separate politicians are removed.
The military has been transferred to four governments since 1960.
In recent months, the armed forces have expressed opposition to AKP candidate Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, due to the past on political Islam.
Gul was first nominated in April, and the government sparked a crisis that has to go to early elections.
The AKP won the elections in mind.
Following the party, Gul, who claimed that the previous initiative was a public will, decided to nominate him as a success of the opposition.
Parliament kicked off the presidential election process on Monday.
In the first round of voting, Gul won the support of 341 lawmakers, but did not provide two majority for the final victory.
The same constitution will also apply for a second round of Friday.
However, the third and fourth round will be enough.
Many analysts expect Gul to be elected in the third round Monday.
In the first round, two other presidents -- the candidate of the National Movement for Network -- Sebrattin Cakizoglu and the Democratic League Party of Democratic Left -- won 70 and 13 votes, respectively, respectively.
Erdogan and other AKP leaders have repeatedly expressed their commitment to secularism and democracy in Turkey to disband army and secularist areas.
"If the election is elected, I will be a constitution," Gul said after his candidacy. "It would be one of the basic principles of protecting Law protection.
No one has been sceptical. "
In an interview with the Canadian D, Erdogan said relations with the AKP after Gul was elected president will end.
"Following the election, Gul will end the relationship with the party after being elected," the AFP quoted him as saying. "The president of the Republic of Turkey will be president."
The army did not interpret a certain comment on the new president.
However, Chief of General Staff General Jasar Bureau said last month that only the people who will be in the post should be in autonomy.
The announcement revealed reports Tuesday that he met with Gul.
He said the army will never apply to the market on such a matter.
"The people are in line with certain politicians, and the efforts of the general staff to be wrong through missile reports that the army is completely reached with certain politicians and reach an agreement," the Green website said in a statement on the website.
"The chief of the General Staff has no secret force, and all meetings are in accordance with the relevant traditions of the state."

Nevertheless, most of the EU members argue that Serbia has offered to sign the SAA before the May elections to prevent nationalist forces who are beneficial for the pro-European forces, and to prevent the gaining of Kosovo independence.
Following the fall of the coalition government last month, the early parliamentary elections were called for early parliamentary elections.
The coalition has been divided over whether Serbia must work closely with the EU after the Kosovo declaration of independence is recognised by most of the EU members.
A recent survey pointed out that the upcoming elections would be closer to recent rates.
President Boris Tadic ’ s Democratic Party (DS) and the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) won around 35% of the vote.
While the DS supports the signing of the SAA, other nationalist parties, including Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica 'Democratic Party of Serbia, see the signing of the document as recognising the independence of Kosovo.
This means the entities could sign the agreement during a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg on April 29th.
In particular, however, Belgium and the Netherlands oppose the signing of the SAA, as the fugitives are not arrested.
The agreement could accept the signing of the agreement if the Netherlands depends on the requirement of the final ratification of indictees later, Reuters said on Monday, citing sources in Brussels.
Kostunica, however, repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly, reiterated the agreement 'stance.
"Rehn supports the unilateral independence of Kosovo and supports the signing of the agreement," the prime minister said. "Serbia is not clear to the national interest of the country, which could be interpreted as an independent Kosovo."
Following a two-day visit to Belgrade on Monday, EU Regional Affairs Commissioner Denuta Huebner warned that Serbia has lost some of the 1 billion-euro aid that the bloc lost by 2013.

A court in Istanbul decided to ban British writer Richard Dawris' website (wwwww.rif.rikg, a court claimed that controversial Islamist and intellectual scientist Adnan Oktar has insisted on his brother.
The high-ranking and intelligence organisation is headed by the campaign against thousands of books in Turkey and in more than 50 other countries, and in the mountain Darlege, where thousands of books are free.
The book of the Judiciary Administration of the Judge of Oktar criticised the website on the website, which he pointed out the rhetoric of Dawles and attacked Oktar.
"I think that this value is expensive and the concept of workers' values'," he wrote in July.
Oktar and producers have won the case against the website, but the writers' prominent Review 'writes did not manage to ban the law.
Last month, the same Istanbul court approved the distribution of the book, saying freedom of expression last April.
The website of Perles' website is not the only victims of the rule of law against Oktar 'group' Dartugal or female sites.
Oktar and products have managed to apply provisional laws for allegedly convicted of Islamist websites, including Google Google Google and Words Press bloc.
Authorities also banned the work of Turkish hotels, such as harm.org.
In late September, one of the main unions, Turkish Educators' Association (Education Sen) passed a request for criticism from the Judiciary Convention (Education Sen) 19 months ago.
The controversial Oktar was sentenced to three years in prison last May to form a personal winner and illegal organisation.
Oktar has a right to decide.
The group is protecting significant financial support and has been charged with the Turkish media to exercise secret, culture practice practices and material products.
Turkish media have responded to the internet laws, which have been unfair.
"There is no doctors to the internet," the daily Radikal said on Tuesday.
The newspaper condemned the internet laws, stressing that most of the laws are not under court decisions, but the country &aposs Communication Directorate has been made by decisions.
Turkey ’ s ruling Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) expressed its commitment to the EU membership protocol and promised to revive reforms.
The latest internet laws, however, have been serious doubts about this donation.
The AKP rejects a secret Islamic agenda and described him as a conservative democracy party.
While some of the AKP members have been opposed to their house ideas in the past, the party does not have a direct connection with Oktar, and he is trying to leave the group.

Milan Lukic, indicted by the UN war crimes tribunal on the murder of hundreds of Serb civilians, was arrested by Argentina police on Tuesday (August 9th), a day after the arrest of Argentina police.
Lukic declared that he would not oppose his extradition to The Hague.
In an indictment issued in November 2000, the tribunal faces charges of torture, terrorism and murder in the Visegrad area of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), along with its north, Aleksanje Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic.
According to the indictment, Lukic and his citizens held a series of attacks against Serb non-Serb civilians, including women, children, lives and workers who are moving to their jobs.
According to the indictment, Milan Lukic, Vasiljevic and others killed five Bosnian Muslims at the Drina River on June 7th 1992.
Three days later, Lukic claimed that seven employees were killed in the murder of the motorway factory in Visegrad.
On June 14th 1992, Milan Lukic, Midoje Lukic and Mitar Vasiljevic claimed that around 70 people were killed in the village of Bikavac.
The victims were forced into a challenge and then were given a house.
Only one person failed to form.
Earlier this month, the Belgrade District court sentenced Lukic to 20 years in prison for the murder of 16 Muslims living in Sjakin, Serbia.
Oliver Krsmanovic and Dragutin Dragicevic were sentenced to 20 years in prison, while Djordje Sevic was sentenced to 15 years.
Lukic was born in Foca, southeastern BiH in 1967. After 1985, he lived in the village of Ruiste, in the village of Visegrad, Serbia, until 1992.
Lukic returned to Visegrad in 1992 as a member of the Serbian paramilitary unit, a member of the Beli Orlovi (Beylers), who was in the system of Muslims.
Rasim Ljajic, head of the National Council for Co-operation with the UN tribunal, said Lukic "the arrest of Serbian security services over the past nine months" is a result of the intensive operations continued by Serbian security services.

Lukic arrived in Argentina and has not been announced.
The arrest of Lukic was the number of suspects that Serbia and Republika Srpska (RS) must hand over to The Hague tribunal, and Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have been arrested.

Serbian Youth and Sports Minister Snezana Samardzic-Markovic said the state would take a series of measures to block violence among sports fans in the country.
The state will invest serious investments in sports infrastructure for improving the overall successful athletes.
In an exclusive interview with Southeast European Times correspondent Bojana Milovanovic, Samardzic-Markovic shares the latest incidents, measures by the government and the future of the country.
SETimes: Following the killings of French football female Brice Taton in Belgrade, violence between the fans' groups have been shown in the Serbian public.
How will Serbia start these problems?
Snezana Samardzic-Markovic: We are talking about various ways.
As we do not have the fundamental elements of Interior and justice ministries, my ministry is fighting violence through preventive and training studies.
One of the most important developments in the past period is the establishment of a government convention of a government council, led by the Serbian prime minister, judicial representatives, sports specialists and journalists.
The message is that the success in the fight against violence can be achieved only if it is moved through institutions.
Twenty sports fans must not be involved in each other, and the holiday clubs have been violence.
Both fans are damaging violence, and some steps are now being taken, and an initiative for the laws of the unknown entity groups, known as calls for violence and violent violence, is now being conducted by the Constitutional Court of Serbia.
A action plan that envisions a series of measures against violence is also on the agenda.
In addition, the British model is in a working group that investigates whether it can be implemented in Serbia.
SETimes: Serbia is recognised with the successful successful success, but the surrounding circumstances of successful athletes are very worse.
How will Serbia be the best antresman conditions?

Samardzic-Markovic: The problem is the worst situation in our country.
In the past two years, 170 open tennis tennis career and 40 sports waste in schools have been rebuilt or rebuilt in schools, four swimming aircraft and a bit explosion.
The National Antrenman Centre of Serbia, which left a city, was restored after 20 years of search.
The Jygymnastics was completely limited, and the swimmer was destroyed. Orada, even though he was not thought to think it is a successful appointment.
Now it has become a proud facility.
The football is very important in Serbia. We will open the Future Eventure in co-operation with international sports companies next year.
More than 50 subsidies from the country will be opened in sports scene by the end of the year.
The state will also turn the swimming programme, such as the swimmer Milorad Cavic, which has changed from 250 to 600 euros.
SETimes: What is the biggest problem that the Serbian youth faces the Serbian youth, and what do you do the ministry as a solution?
Samardzic-Markovic: Serbia is the only regional country that is not the national youth strategy.
It is not only a simple document, but also a political signal, because the lack of such a strategy is not a political signal, because it means that there is no idea that Serbia will do with young people at the time, it means that young people do not recognise the system.
I am very satisfied for our change. Since May 9th 2008, Serbia has a strategy for young people.
I am aware that I am aware of the ministry, and only five of the 167 municipalities in Serbia had a youth office.
This is a reflection of the situation in our society.
If you change in the process, we have changed the 100th youth office on November 9th.
The goal of such units is to find a solution to the fundamental problems that young people have expressed.
The first problem is insufficient, lack of information and a third of the elements that will bring them to a quality of quality.
The young people will help achieve the mayoral mayor, and the local government has the doors to see young people and make them difficult to respect their activities.

It is also responsible for young people to report the event and activities.
Meanwhile, two initiatives for young people are being implemented, with the support of youth offices.
Eight per cent of young people in Serbia are working for others.
I want the young people to build their own jobs and want them.
SETimes: What is the quality of young people in Serbia and the quality of life in other countries in the region?
Samardzic-Markovic: We are more ideas from other countries in the region, and at least, the European Council of Europe 'unilateral company, which is a multilateral European youth policy.
This development, which began with the National Youth Strategy, was a major geography.
We are in a country for example, and 46 other members of the Council of Europe have received us an example.
SETimes: In the 1990s, many young people have left Serbia.
This trend is far less, but it is still at large.
How can you convince young people to stay in Serbia and return?
Samardzic-Markovic: In 2007, we have been researching a large climate of young people in small circumstances and a researcher to foster Serbia.
The same research results showed that in 2009, the trend is 10 per cent of the trend, "the Youth Youth Fund is one of the methods that could reduce the immigration".
As part of the Fund, 2200s and awards have been given so far.
They have returned to Serbia after the best students and irregularities in Serbia, while at least five years, there are young people who want to transfer their options abroad to more levels.
As part of the Youth Retenek Fund, the centre is also helping young people to use their optimism.
EU members have doubt on enlargement
Those countries have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeated their commitment to enlargement, but the EU summit in June was worried to Western Balkan countries.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 13 / 07 / 06
"We need more than we need to change some rules in the EU," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said. [Getty Images]
At the latest summit in mid-June, EU member states and prime ministers ordered the European Commission (EC) to assess a assessment on the "inefficiency" of new EU members by December 2006.
At the same time, the leaders also delayed a debate on amendments to the European Constitution, which many analysts see the necessary expansion.
Germany, Spain and Italy defend smaller changes in the current house, while France, the Netherlands and Britain are calling for a completely new Constitution.
Britain has been opposed to the transfer of its authority from member states to institutions in Brussels.
If the constitution is unacceptable, the candidate countries could have serious effects on their prospects.
First, Croatia is hoping to join the bloc by 2010.
Those who are still unable to organise the new country &
While there is no debate on the European future of the Western Balkans, countries in the region will have to expect the EU to resolve internal problems.
"We need more than every year to change some rules in the EU," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said.
The consequences reached at the meeting also stressed that the EC will do on the "inefficiency force" of the EU, and that the process should be made to European citizens.
This is a key condition for the Dutch and French citizens to reject the draft constitution, which is concerned that the enlargement process "would be a threat to intelligence and living standards".
Participants at least reaffirmed their commitment to the enlargement process.
"The new members were a historic opportunity that will contribute to peace, security, stability, democracy, the rule of law and prosperity of the EU as a whole," the result said in a statement.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn was optimistic, saying the summit opened the way for a "new compromise".
The compromise "should strengthen our interest in the creation of a peace, democracy and prosperity zone in Europe, as well as to ensure that we accept new members," Rehn said.
The Western Balkan countries have promised membership at the Thessaloniki summit in 2003, and it has been considered many documents since.
Last autumn, Croatia and Turkey began accession talks, while candidate status was given to Macedonia or candidate status.
Albania recently signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, while Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina have yet to do so.

UNESCO cannot work more true than declaring a 2006 declaration of Nikola Tesla.
The events of the world are being held to reveal their success.
In April, Cnegative University organised a symposium.
The UN was sponsored by a exhibition in June, when Tesla continues to work until 1875 and 1878.
The same month was sent to a letter to Nikola Tesla, where each mobile phone bills in Australia were sent.

Croatian President Stipe Mesic, Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, Serbian President Boris Tadic and US Ambassador to Croatia Robert Bradtak were among several officials who participated in the opening of the centre.
"Tesla is a joint Serb heritage that does not want to ask ethnic conflict," Tadic said. "However, our past is not always a parliament.
Today, we have a joint responsibility, like our citizens to present a new vision. "
"Tesla is a Mediterranean supply that the balance began in Smiljan 150 years ago, and the borders continue to go to the world today," Mesic said.
In addition, Croatia and Serbia have been a factor that emphasises the century of industrial transportation and showed that the surrounding and nationalism is located.
As part of the arrests, the Serbian central bank discovered special patients and posters in the case, and some of the Belgrade airport were changed to "read" the 20th century ".
Tesla (1856-1943), the primary principle of returning restaurants, hotels, physical communications, and more than 700 explosive explosions.
Tesla is the only Balkan scientist who was used as a unit in the international monitoring system.

Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu was expected to speak to the UN Security Council during a separate meeting Thursday (July 13th).
"I will call for the Security Council to support the independence of Kosovo," Sejdiu told New York on Tuesday. "I am very important that I have a chance to preserve the Security Council representatives and reveal the chances of political vision."
Although Sejdiu will take place at an official meeting on the Security Council, a Kosovo official will also be the first speaker to the establishment of a Kosovo official.
Although Prime Minister Agim Ceku and predecessor Bajram Kosumi attended the Security Council meetings, they did not have the right to book.
Following the status talks in Vienna with the Kosovo delegation, Sejdiu described independence as a request for "no negotiation", saying that a sovereignty should be given a permanent seat in the UN.
"Everything independent state or small, it is a key factor in the international community," Sejdiu said.
As an official part of Serbia, Kosovo has been under UN restoration since 1999, when Slobodan Milosevic had to withdraw from the province.
The majority of Albanians want independence, while Serbia wants to protect sovereignty and is offering "real autonomy" instead of it.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, who repeatedly repeatedly reiterated his position with US officials this week, will perform the Security Council.
Kostunica is not expected to meet with Sejdiu.
"The independence of Kosovo will be a substantial independence to the region," Kostunica said at a press conference Tuesday after meeting with US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice.
At the same time, Serbian President Boris Tadic said in an interview with state television that Belgrade is working to continue some sovereignty over Kosovo.
He also warned, however, that the negotiating position has been weakened due to the heritage of Milosevic years.
Milosevic 'policies are not leaving more forests to Serbia, Tadic said, but added that the government would not stop the fight by using the "legitimate vehicles".

The highest-level parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the two police reform laws, signed on Wednesday (April 16th), paving the way for the country to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.

The participation came after talks on the entities -- Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of BiH (RS) -- on the restructuring of the country &aposs police organisation, which each other has its own police.
The initiatives of the agreement have been blocked by Bosnian Serb parties, who fear that police reforms needed for EU membership will be prepared by the end of RS.
At the end of the parties, Supreme Contact Miroslav Lajcak proposed a consensus that envisions the establishment of seven state-level co-ordination agencies that will take over the country 'authority on ethnic police services over the next year.
The ruling Bosniak Party of Democratic Action and the Serbian Democratic Action Party criticised the Serbian Democratic Action and the Serbian Democratic Party for criticising the amendments to "boycott", which will not be better in BiH.
Although the planned plan was unveiled by the EU requested the first request for the establishment of a single police force within the country, Brussels has signaled that police will serve as professional and will accept any agreement that the ethnic entity will leave.
EU officials praised BiH politicians on Wednesday for removing the latest obstacle to signing the SAA, a key step towards eventual EU membership.
The agreement was signed in December, but Brussels said it would be suspended after an agreement on the restructuring of the police.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday that the agreement would not only be able to "provide bridge benefits in trade", adding that BiH will approach candidate status.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who described the move Wednesday as a "decisive step" for BiH, said the SAA would be signed soon ".
Imza could take place in a recent meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg.
"If there are Technical challenges, the next signing will be 26 May," Slovenian Ambassador to BiH Natasa Vodup, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Wednesday.
If the problems are realistic, the signing could be held at the next meeting of EU foreign ministers on 16 June.
"After this road, there is no country that cannot be a member of the EU," Lajcak said, adding that "the EU and investors have sent a strong signal that BiH is open to trade." The police restructuring process has welcomed the restructuring process.

About 800 soldiers from Bulgaria, Romania and the US armed forces, as well as hundreds of personnel who have provided logistics and other necessary support.
First, the exercise, developed by the US Army and the 7th European Army Commander in 2002, aims to boost the ability of three NATO member states to work together.
According to Colonie Yurie Tanase, the head of the Romanian Command Forces Command, the Romanian soldiers' Commander and exercises, Romanian soldiers are also intended to increase war capabilities at the level of unity, unity and General Staff.
They are taking the real truth to promote weapons, the Kenth Arab Storm Operations, aircraft operations and cross-border households.
"We do not understand the first time with 16, and it will not be the last time," said Romanian Headquarters Commander Temen Konstantin Parasivu. "We are the basis of our work in the field or waste area.
With the same standards, a training army is more effectively affected in the real situation.
We are education for this, "he said.
Bulgarian Army Chief of Staff Chief of Staff Colonel Petar Petrov said the soldiers want to join the exercise because they have not been warning with Western forces.
"We want to see as part of NATO forces," Petrov said. "We want to organise exercise exercises under NATO."
Bulgarian and Romanian soldiers are demanding new tactics to block terrorism groups and their remarks, ensuring effective and weapons, they said.
One of the key response was the use of the European Team Initiative (DISE) system (DISE).
They can monitor everything in the area of war with DISE equipment and reserve weapons, linked to clothes, cheapers and soldiers.
When the move ended, they can remove everything from the TV station.
Colonel James Sweden, commander of the 1st Legal Union Intelligence and the IR06 exercise director of the IR06, said it is unlikely to see Bulgarian, Bulgarian and Romanian soldiers in a real conflict operation, but has increased mutual confidence.
"We do not have a better way to boost confidence and understanding of our soldiers against each other," the US daily Stars and Stripes quoted the US daily as saying. "We cannot achieve a separate unity in this level."
A Romanian swimmer, who participated in the attorney, reiterated the remarks.
"If we have to work together, we do not recognise one of the unit, and we are education," said Kristian Rosu, the 26th of Romania.

This could affect oil transactors, particularly disaster.
"If it comes, only 50 per cent of the necessary price hike will cover the necessary price increase, then it will end," Atanackovic said.
Miroslav Probisevic, director of the Free Centre for Free Sunday, says authorities are undefended the attempts to block a gas increase in order to meet the 8.5 per cent inflation target.
"The solution that the government has proposed is that it will spark everything, to foster the NIS and the gasoline industry," said Probisevic. "How will it invest in these conditions?"
Such solutions to us have two markets, instead of liberalisation: prices in the market and domestic markets are set to be defined by prices in the world markets, "he said.
But Serbian National Bank of Serbia Governor Radovan Jelasic insists the NIS is also another options to reflect prices to consumers.
"If the banking system is not only because of the Serbian National Bank of Serbia, all the economy is not enough to clean the NIS," Jelasic said.
"The mandate of the NIS is to do with domestic restructuring and internal reforms," he said.

Experts Together Energy and Investment for Serbian Parliament
students are helping the parliamentary process and energy.
The result is a more efficient democracy process for everyone.
By Let Bartet for Southeast European Times - 07 / 07 / 03
Representatives of each democracy are elected in the autonomy of parliament.
However, lawmakers have also made a huge increase in the secret support of the parliamentary staff, which is necessary to research with voters and fulfil administrative tasks.
However, the assembly in Southeast Europe has no resources in this area.
Although there are no libraries or computer networks, the staff, who has been spent during the communist era when parliament had a different role in the communist period.
A new project, created by the OSCE, aims to overcome these problems.
The overall ranking is the new sovereignty and energy structure in the formation of students who spent a few weeks to help lawmakers and committee commitments.
This practice is a very widespread model in Western Europe, when it is voluntarily voluntarily, competition is very high for lawmakers' research.
Everybody in the project enjoys the benefit.
While lawmakers are able to use the internet and research personnel, the majority is helping the current parliamentary staff at the current parliamentary staff.
They are learning how the parliament is doing really, while they can have a restoration that could be really valuable in their work and universities.
The Society also benefits from a more efficient assembly and a young population that is committed to democratisation of the parliamentary processes.
The initiative is not satisfied with everyone.
Vojin Kovacevic, a law student at the University of Belgrade, says some of the current parliamentary staff seems to see them as a threat.
Tito and Milojevic are working under the new government.
Many do not know how the computer will be opened, "he said." Although many of the new generation deputies are businessmen, many of the others are doing their jobs, they are doing a little effort to research or represent their voters.
In general, the project has made great success.
Kovacevic is spent about three times in parliament, with an average of 10 to 15 hours.
A lawmaker, a lawmaker who serves as the main message, has been deeply invited and asked neighbouring and EU countries to help him in research.
Kovacevic ordered the laws and assist his lawmaker as soon as possible information about the differences in the Serbian law, thus helping the process of harmonising Serbian laws with European model.
Kovacevic says the 55 students working in the Serbian and federal assembly are very satisfied with the situation and have established very good professional relations with lawmakers, if political trends are nor political trends.
Instead, the project was successfully successful to the Vojvodina Assembly next year.
Greece and IOC Relations on Security Relations in 2004 Olympics
Authorities responded to a newspaper, saying security was the list of priority priorities in the Olympics and said any measures are taken to ensure it.
(AFP, ANA - 28 / 09 / 03; Washington Post, Reuters - 27 / 09 / 08)
Officials from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Athens 2004 Organisation Committee (ATHOC) have rejected criticism of the Summer Games on security arrangements.
"It is positive," IOC President Jacques Rogge told Greek media on Sunday (September 28th).
The president came a day after the Washington Post reported that the secret intellectuals had a serious violation of security.
According to the report, an excavation of the move has managed to come from one of the stage security control points.
In Post, another statement shows that the explosion has managed to explosive explosives.
"All the Greeks have been passed," the US security plan quoted him as saying.
"If you know that we can go back, the chemical and biological goods cannot be a problem," he said. "The newspaper suggested the police forces' reports, underlining the efforts to ensure the security of thousands of athletes and athletes that are expected to arrive in Athens more than a year.
In addition, the paper also pointed out delays in the establishment of a commander and control centre, which will provide information from the Olympics and reach the information as soon as possible.
However, Greeks rejected allegations.
ATHOC said in a press release Sunday that security organisers in the Games are the list of priorities and that any measures are taken to ensure that.
"It is the only true true of any phenomenon and the reputation of the underground: Greece is ready to organise the Olympic players in 2004 in a completely safe way," the statement quoted him as saying.
Greek government spokesperson Kristos Progress, who reiterated the organisers' remarks, said critics are "no relationship".
"There are some factors that believe we can pressure on us, but we are continuing to see them as a natural natural gas and to establish the most safe Olympics in history," he said.
Greece has allocated 640m euros for security arrangements.
More than 45,000 police, military and special vacation will be waiting for this largest security operation of the Olympic history.
According to Reuters, the number of figures at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney was about three times.
In addition, the consultant group, including Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Israel, Spain and the United States, is ready to provide expertise.
Voicing confidence that the Greek government "has done the best possible security arrangements", Rogge said, adding that "no one can guarantee 100 per cent on security."

The accusations of the former presidential adviser have sparked new suspects over the internal internal intervention of Romanian secret services.

Last month, Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) chief Claujdiu Saftoiu linked to a television programme, restoring a debate on Romanian secret services' intervention.
During his mandate, he said, President Traian Basescu had found that President Traian Basescu could include the contention of telephone talks between the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) leader Mircea Geoana and former head of state Ion Ilescu.
"I have learned political interventions from the Romanian president, who said Iliescu and Geoana, who said he had know what he can speak to the speech," the former SIE chief said.
Following the crowd, Saftoiu tried to change his remarks and said the president did not give them direct to him, but Basescu has made their statements against the media.
The president did not respond to these remarks.
His spokesperson, Valeriu Turdjan, dismissed the allegations and said Basescu would hand Saftoiu for his "reality and irregularities".
"If Romanian citizens claim they had information about political or private life, this is the position of the president, which is convicted of persecution of a crime," he said, stressing that Basescu is the first president of the opposition to the leaders of both the SIE and Romania Intelligence Service (SRI).
Both agencies have repeatedly discovered telephone talks.
"Without the mines," Iliescu said.
"I hope that Bay Saftoiu will be closed," Geoana said.
This was a year ago before a parliamentary commission, the SIE head, who said Saftoiu had announced the first announcement of the intelligence services that citizens of the intelligence service were repeatedly postponed, he said, citing telephone talks on the prosecution.
The law envisions the SIE to learn telephones in Romania, but through internal affairs counterpart SRI, it can do with the prosecution decision.
The scandal, which was explosive after his indictment, has ended his close relationship with Basescu and forced him to resign.
This latest scandal came at a time when telephone talks, short messages and e-posters discussed public debate on the law on the 298 / 2008.
According to the law, all telephone talks must keep their data for six months: the identity of those who search and search persons, the time for talks.
As of March 15th, Internet services will have to reserve analysts on all e-posters.
The state agencies will have an investigation into a crime, while statistics will have the right to work.
Critics worry that the law will harm civil freedom.

There are two homes on a response in the north of Kosovo.
These are leaving homes outside the repression of the border between Albanian and Serb population in the northern part of the Iber River in the divided town of Suhadoll.
One of the Albanian owner says reconstruction is impossible because local Serbs reject their plans.
Police and KFOR rescue their Albanian neighbours for more than one time.
The ongoing dispute over a house is an example of instability and tensions that have been removed by a number of ethnic incidents -- for example of Albanian stations -- and a Serbian businessman began in late 2008.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci promised the future of the rule of law and order in each part of Kosovo, and also included Mitrovica in particular.
Mitrovica Mayor Bajram Rexhepi said police, EUFOR and KFOR fully support their activities.
According to Rexhepi, many multiethnic gifts that began weeks ago have created confidence among the public.
Therefore, we support them to ensure a safe and secure environment for everyone, "Interior Minister Zenin Payaziti said, praised them for improving security.
On January 23rd, Mitrovica police spokesperson Besim Hoti told the Pristina Express that police arrested two local Serbs, saying some progress has been made.
"Police [them] arrested them because they were displaced the mosques," Hoti said, referring to a violence that damaged more than 50 cars from ethnic Albanians.
While the north continues to maintain Kosovo balance, some people like Christian Science Monitor are Elizabeth Roberd, who are the Christian Science Monitor.
He argues that Belgrade and the EU have launched a "sufficient co-operation" to remove northern Kosovo.
According to Josd, Serbian intellectuals have blocked Serbs "the problem, while Kosovo police, EULEX police and KFOR peacekeeepers stopped" Albanian victims ".
Another sign of interim progress, officials in Serbia and Kosovo, as well as some journalists in Serbia and Kosovo, see more than key ethnic incidents as the reason for the catastrophic, and both Serbian and Albanian criminal gangs are beginning to note that.
Nevertheless, the opposition Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AEC) has accused the government of failing to make enough efforts for ethnic Albanians in the north.
AEC head and former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said on Sunday (February 8th) that after power, the divided town of Mitrovica could reunite the divided town of Mitrovica within three months.
In Kosovo, the November elections will be held.
Schwarz-Schilling is "unfortunately" of BiH lawmakers, Schwarz-Schilling said.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is in a serious political crisis and the European path is now on, the Supreme representative said on Wednesday.

High Representative and EU Special Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling told members of the state parliament on Wednesday (June 13th) that the time is time to restore dialogue on constitutional reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Schwarz-Schilling, who was the last time before the end of his mandate, said that BiH is in a serious political crisis, due to reforms, reducing security against politicians and the negative rhetoric of people in the public.
"I am convinced that the politicians have done and policies that have created a fear among the entities, instead of building confidence among all sides and to ensure concrete progress in truth issues," he said.
"Do you agree to use radical rhetoric rhetoric rhetoric in order to vote more?
How can the country be accepted to create concerns about other incidents in the region in order to fear their products?
I say that this is unacceptable, "he added.
In the past few days, political leaders in BiH have met separate talks with Schwarz-Schilling and the United States and German growth.
Bosnian presidency member Haris Silajdzic and Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik visited Washington for talks with the US State Department, but the talks were not a significant change in their positions.
Since then, the high representative has decided to receive high representatives.
Last year, a constitutional reform package did not approve the parliament.
In the last elections, a two-thirds majority of the parliamentary support is still under way.
"We are supporting the constitutional reform package because we will likely have to start new talks because of the lack of political will," Dodik said after a meeting with international representatives.
The main dispute is the entity votes in parliament.
Most of the Bosniak representatives oppose a requirement for the adoption of a certain number of MPs from each entities for the adoption of any bill.
Bosniak lawmakers say this would slow progress.
However, RS counterparts are determined to protect the article, arguing that they will stop in the number of votes if the case is removed.
International officials warn that the political crisis has blocked BiH 'progress towards EU membership, and that is discouraged by the public and the trust of politicians.
He said on Wednesday that BiH has not been accomplishing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU for several months, but the latest step has not been accomplished and failed to reach an agreement on police reform.
The Office of the High Representative (OHR), such as the Partnership for Peace Implementation Council (OHR), due to the situation in BiH and the region, has decided not to close the situation, he said.
"This is a step," Schwarz-Schilling said. "The OHR remains to ensure peace and stability in the period of difficult political instability that we have been in place."
Cyprus, EU-NATO co-operation point
Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, a member of the EU in 2004, and is demanding a new strategic co-operation agreement between the bloc.
The agreement could also affect peacekeeping plans in Kosovo.

Discussions between Turkey and the EU have slowed efforts to boost defence co-operation, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer ranked the agenda during talks with officials in Ankara this week.
Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said Turkey does not oppose improving relations between NATO and the EU, but that should be done with the current opportunities, rather than new co-operation mechanisms.
According to the "Berlin Plus" agreement in 2002, strategic co-operation between NATO or the two organisations that are not a member of the Partnership for Peace.
Since then, however, the country has become a member of the EU, including the northern part of the Turkish leadership, and insists that other new members that joined the Union in 2004 should be part of it.
This is an important point for Turkey, which does not recognise the Greek Cypriot administration in the south.
Ankara argues that until a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus issue has been resolved for decades, Nicosia must not be allowed to hold a meeting of EU-NATO missions.
Turkey wants Cyprus to give up its intention to block the European Defence Agency, a commission established to strengthen the European weapons industry.
"The money was set in 2002," the daily Zaman quoted him as saying.
As a country that has made great contributions to NATO, Turkey must not expect more flexibility on this issue, "he said." Only Turkey should not be expected to do with Turkey. "
As NATO is in such cases, the EU must find a solution before it shows that it is unable to impose this issue. "
The situation could also affect its plans to expand co-operation between NATO troops and the police mission in Kosovo.
If the UN Security Council currently passes the status plan, police in Kosovo could take over its mandate from NATO this year.
The planned transport facility is interested in 1,500 EU personnel who serve as part of the 16,000 NATO peacekeeping force.
However, the framework of the EU-EU co-operation in Kosovo in the future must be set.
Turkey has made serious contributions to peace and stability operations in the entire world, including NATO and the EU in Afghanistan.
Last week, however, Ankara decided to withdraw its commitments on future peacekeeping missions.
As a NATO member, Turkey has promised to send a letter to the EU, Headquarters Goal, a military target under the security and defence strategy.
However, the EU proposed Turkish letters "instead of" active forces ", Turkish generals and diplomats who want to play a long-important role.
Turkey has made significant contribution, but also above its command and and control structures under the EU co-operation framework.
De Hoop Scheffer told reporters during his visit to Ankara that talks between partners will continue at a constructive airport.
He then arrived in Brussels to join the NATO defence ministers' meeting.
Reporting: UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier
SETimes recently met with UNMIK chief Lamberto Zannier and discussed the current role of the mission in Belgrade, relations with Belgrade and the future of UNMIK.
"Of course, Belgrade and UNMIK officials are more easier to meet at the highest level," Zannier said. [File]
SETimes: How do you recognise the current role of the UN mission in Kosovo, when Kosovo independence, the current speech of international peacekeeping forces, the UN mission in Kosovo?
Zannier: UNMIK continues to operate in accordance with the mandate of the Security Council Resolution 124.
The incidents last year, however, were necessary to restructuring -- including the EU legal mission in December, as well as the start of the mission.
The result has now emphasised the mission 'political role.
Furthermore focusing on the monitoring and report, facilitating greater cleansing with all communities in Kosovo, facilitation of split clearing, promoting practical problems between Pristina and Belgrade.
The mission also continues to play a role in the areas where they are playing.
For example, the mission could be given the management role in northern Mitrovica, and that is the only municipality that we have executed such a authority.
Another example is to facilitate the Kosovo representation in Interpol.
SETimes: What is EULEX, the EU Special Representative and the International Civilian Representative (ICO)?
How do you co-operate in most areas?
Zannier: international missions in Kosovo have different tasks here.
As you know, EULEX is in Kosovo under the 124 provisional decision.
Since the transfer of the family, EULEX has completed our job as the OSCE.
Co-operation with EULEX is very good.
Earlier this year, UNMIK and EULEX signed a number of technical agreements aimed at facilitating the case, mechanisms and assets from UNMIK.
This relationship is now under consultations in many levels, including the head of the mission, Yves de Kermabon.
Of course, EULEX is operating under UN authority, has also submitted a report among the secretary-general reports to the security council.
The UN Security Council has acknowledged the Ahtisaari Plan, which is why UNMIK and the ICO did not co-operate.
This is not a problem for us, because we see the ICO role as a consultant to the government.
However, with the worst EU special representative, Pieter Feith, I talk with a regular opinion of a double information.
SETimes: What is your relationship with Pristina and Belgrade?
In all, what is your relationship with Pristina and Belgrade?
"UNMIK Executive Directorate is the only legal authority in Mitrovica," he said. [File]
Zannier: As the latest report by the general secretary secretary-General, Kosovo authorities have been less direct representation among the Kosovo authorities.
The reason is that Pristina has to work with other international players.
However, we have an opportunity to discuss bridge co-operation between Pristina and the mission, for example, and for example, the security council and other international regulations, including Pristina officials.
UNMIK has more effectively affected authorities in Kosovo, outside Pristina, where we are working with all sides to resolve practical problems such as the return of the IDP (SDP) in the north.
Of course, it is easy to meet UNMIK officials at the highest level.
We discussed a wide range of levels in various levels, including meetings between the secretary General Special Representative (SRSG) and the government, as well as meetings with the UN Open in Belgrade.
Furthermore, they can change until the overall political trends exceeds more specific technical debate.
SETimes: How do you have the only legal authority mission in northern Kosovo?
Zannier: I think that our role in the north is wrong in the media, and I thank you to question this question.
UNMIK Governor Mitrovica (UAM) really is the only legal authority in northern Mitrovica, but in the north -- and really, the administrative role in Kosovo -- is the only one that all sides are accepted.
UNMIK is in order to avoid an administrative bottom to ensure that bridge needs, such as the control of fastro registration.
Therefore, all sides have recognised the UAM and we have the support of people who live in the centre.
SETimes: As the six-search plan, the foresee is not in the direction of orijinal, and what is the meaning for the region?
Zannier: The talks on bridge issues were held last year, and the General Assistant secretary-General said in the November report on Kosovo.
Now we have a very broad agenda of this report, and it is also including returns or missing persons.
A number of other international actors are also on the process.
UNMIK continues to support the participation of the participation of all sides without practical solutions to the benefit of all sides.
The issue of this issue is politically politicised, because it is to make progress in broad practical issues that we need.
Political cafes are damaging all sides.
SETimes: How will you expect to see in the future to see the UN Mission in Kosovo and how will the mission be on the agenda?
Zannier: The mission will continue to work to fulfil its mandate.
For now, the political role will continue to be the basis of our political role, especially in the society, when I announced the first problem.
I see any significant change in the role of the mission in the future.
As you know, however, the mission has always stopped the circumstances and we will continue to assess the situation and we will do with any UN headquarters in the future.
Turkish media group sparked punishment in EU
The punishment on 2 billion euros of the country &aposs largest media group could open Turkey and Brussels.
By Emir Izemli for Southeast European Times in Ankara -- 16 / 09 / 09
Turkey ’ s businessman, Aydin Dogan, decided to punish a huge punishment of the media group, prompted questions about press freedom. [AFP]
In an unprecedented move earlier this month, the Turkish government punished about 1.7 billion euros in tax penalties to Doan, the largest media group, the country, which was sentenced to 340m euros in February.
The penalties, the largest penalties that have been sparked to a Turkish company, could be an obstacle to the country ’ s EU integration process.
Dogan Media Group, owner of the newspapers, deep and television stations, says the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has been targeted due to a continued bribery between the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
In March, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the public to boycott the newspapers of Dogan, for allegedly unfounded "corruption stores", as he allegedly deserves the AKP.
Also in the news, Turkish Cypriots claimed government paramilitaries in the scandal of the Denmark Financial Association, a literature in Germany.
According to the media, millions of euros of donor money in 2007 have been transferred to Turkey.
A German court has accused three Turkish citizens of corruption and sent a Turkish judicial system to continue all documents.
He also said that some AKP members, including the close friend of Erdogan, could be linked to corruption, including Zahid Aman.
He claims that the money on the illegal road to Turkey is spent on the establishment of pro-government news channels such as Canadian.
These allegations are continued, and the public has not yet been submitted to the court.
A investigation is said.
Erdogan, meanwhile, dismissed the penalties against Dogan, who said tax administration is independent.
The Turkish media sector, including newspapers, Milliyet and Radikal, Milliyet and Radikal, has about 50% of the Turkish media sector, including television channels, the Canadian D and Star TV and a Time-Warner partner, CNN.
Other half of the eight are the pro-government companies, except for a few independent companies.
According to Turkish law, the Dogan group is now two options.
The group agreed to accept the tax fraud claims and require reduction of the money penalty, or could invest significant amounts to the treasury to the tax court.
The EU has now expressed concerns.
A spokesperson said the penalties could affect the progress report, which will be released next week.
"There are still concerns about freedom of expression and the creation of the popular things that are not popular," Richard Howitt, a member of the British European Parliament, told VOA.
And I think it is still a textile that Turkey must learn, as part of a modern European democracy and many of them, "he said.

Serbia will try to sell JAT Airways to sell the national air transport company, estimated to around 300m euros.
The first tender for the sale of the 51% stake in 2008 was the first tender for the sale of the company (51m euros), which was set to be registered by any company.
This time, the state decided to change its strategy and submit a new company that does not debt potential partners.

"It will have a completely new company with the state of Serbia, while JAT is now the most vulnerable -- the current movie, pillars, pillars, the world and Europe," said Air Trade Air Trade Minister Miodrag Milikovic.
But Belgrade economist Migrt Busatlia has concerns about the success of the JAT sale.
"The tender opened at a time when the global economic crisis seems to regain.
Therefore, people have been able to travel before.
It is completely uncertain that the Serbian airline will reach an agreement with the Serbian airline, "he said.
Busatlia also controversy the government has also discussed another decision: the JAT has sparked its debt and spread Serbian tax taxes.
"Instead of opening the tender, the state must try to restructuring JAT, reduce debts and make more functional.
However, in such cases, there are many politicians and many professional professionals in Serbia, "he said.
Economist Milan Kovacevic said the JAT is the private aircraft rights that are the most important presence.
However, it does not guarantee the success of the tender.
"It is a true value of the JAT, which is the right to foster Cazz points," Kovacevic said.
"This is my husband, but prior to the rise of the company 'debt and more workers," he said.
In Belgrade, the political opposition opposed the tender.
The Serbian Radical Party said that JAT 'cost is 220m euros and the government wants to sell it with low prices.
"The decision by the Serbian government to sell the JAT for strategic partnership is a plan to sell the company 'goods for almost every month and to bring the JAT' debt to the state and Serbian citizens," the Radikal Party said.
The agency, a powerful airline, has dropped in operations over the past 20 years.
According to official data, the JAT movie currently has only 14 mobile flights -- Boeing 737-300 and four -- ATR2, which is currently under way.

Turkey faces key role in Libya
The Turkish policy in Libya is questioning how it would be pushing for its neighbouring Syria.

In an effort to demonstrate Turkey &aposs leading role in Libya, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu arrived on Tuesday (August 23rd) to meet with leaders of the National Electoral Council (NTC) and visited Bingi to visit Libya since they entered Trabs.
During his visit, Davutoglu confirmed that NATO support will continue until security is reached, stressing the need for free, democratic, security, stable and unified Libya.
Davutoglu also promised financial and insufficient support, saying the Libyan Contact Group political directors will be discussed at a meeting in Istanbul on Thursday.
"This is why the Turkish foreign policy is so far," said German Marshall Fund Security Commissioner Joshua Walker. "This is why the international community speaks on the island of the Turkish media, and the first leader in Libya will be able to become a comprehensive one of the Turkish media."

In the coming weeks to get more information, we are visiting B.com.
In February, when the riots against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi began, Turkey was cold in sanctions and NATO intervention.
Turkey has been charged with "double", citing an unusual policy that does not exercise its interests and ideologies.
Turkey was removed to Gaddafi, and the most developed economic interests focused on the construction and construction sector.
About 25,000 Turkish citizens were working in Libya, and the conservative firms have taken the project more than 120 billion.
In May, however, Turkey urged Gaddafi to resign and recognised NTC in early July.
Since then, the country has since played an extraordinary role in supporting the islands.
In July, Turkey hosted the fourth Libyan Contact Group meeting in Istanbul, and the last few weeks have been able to cover large amounts and money.
Turkey witnesses recognised the international community and stopped them to the end of the repression.
Given the NTC and friendship relations, Turkey is now genocide to play a major economic and political role in Libya.
"Turkey will continue to build economic network with Libya, as it was before the Arab Charter, but now Turkey will open its democratic rules to boost its role in the region," said Doshne McDjurdy, a high researcher at the Middle East Democracy Project (POMED).
"Turkey is one of the most important allies in many parts, as Ankara has the opportunity to provide regional influence and support.
As NATO membership and the OIC presidency are also the head of the OIC, international support for a united Libya could create a really bridge between the islands and the West, "he adds.
Gaddafi is expected soon, the decline in Syria shows increasing pressure in Syria, where he urged Turkey to launch reform and end violence against demonstrators.
"Those in Libya are a textile for regional leaders.
"The leaders who do not do not say they cannot remain in power," he cautioned.
As Syria continues pressure, the reform commissions have not been repeated by Turkey, and Davutoglu arrived until he said he had nothing to speak with Esad, Turkey has not been able to resign or Esad.
Nevertheless, the Libyan experience shows that Turkey &aposs stance could change very quickly, and the Assad regime could begin to tackle it.
"If no one in Syria will continue this relationship between Assad and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it is very clear," Walker said.
Even if Turkey has been in Libya on Syria, the problem will not be a concrete action if it is unique or Turkish leader, "he said.
Merkel message to Belgrade
Some surveys say that Serbia is unconnected with the European integration and the unit of Kosovo, but German leader Angela Merkel gave a different view to Belgrade.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Serbia on Tuesday (August 23rd) and was not a message to President Boris Tadic.
During the talks, Merkel was linked to Kosovo, with the continuation of the European integration process.
This is the latest message to Serbian authorities, who are confident that European integration and Kosovo is two separate months.
Merkel was aware of his message: Germany wants Serbia in the EU, but also in the dialogue with Pristina, EULEX should be able to operate in the entire territory of Kosovo, and should be able to operate in the "parallel structures" in Kosovo.
"Germany recognised Kosovo, while Serbia recognised Kosovo.
This is a situation that must be achieved, "he said.
The prime minister, however, has not requested Belgrade to recognise the independence of Pristina.
Belgrade is not parallel, but as its own state institutions operating in Kosovo, which has refused to recognise more independence.
Merkel said that resolving the Kosovo issue is a long time, but stressed that it should be made to Belgrade on its path to EU membership.
"Therefore, it is better to solve today, instead of the difficult problems," he said.
Tadic said he did not respond to "parallel structures", but said Serbia has its own principles and is not "disappointed" that it could bring conflict to the EU.
"Serbia has its own principles in resolving the conflict and we want to find a very practical way to protect all people in the region," Tadic said.
He promised that Serbia will continue dialogue with Pristina authorities.
Belgrade Political Sciences professor Predrag Simic said Merkel 'message is that Serbian authorities should accept the Ahtisaari plan on Kosovo.
"Belgrade will have to accept the implementation of the Ahtisaari plan and will be the way for EU membership, which is why it refuses to do so," Simic told SETimes.
Serbia denied the Ahtisaari plan because the country has blocked its allies in the UN Security Council -- Russia and Chinese -- in the UN.
The plan envisions autonomy in a certain level of Serbian society, and envisions independence of Kosovo.
Belgrade supports Serbs living in northern Kosovo without operating Pristina institutions.
"These institutions will be very bad for the interests of the Serb community in Kosovo, as well as for the interests of Serbs in the province," Kosovo Transport Project Director Aleksandar Mitic told SETimes.
Officials in Pristina have begun Merkel ’ s messages.
Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Thaci said Belgrade received "clear and fair messages".
However, analysts say the visit of Merkel is more deeper.
He said that this is the first beautiful behaviour, which has been shown by the leader of a G7 members since Serbia declared independence in 2006 and declared independence.
"This is important because Germany has the most stable economy and is the entire eurozone in a deep economic crisis," Simic said.
Since 2000, Germany has invested 1.27 billion euros in Serbia.
Serbia exports to Germany at 760m euros, while Germany exports to Serbia 1.3 billion euros.
Corridor 8: People to join the Union
Representatives of the countries involved in the Pan-European Transport Corridor 8 project discussed accelerating the highway and railway construction studies at a meeting in Tirana.
By Valentin Nesovski for Southeast European Times in Skopje - 15 / 07 / 03
The Pan-European Transport Corridor 8, the Pan-European Transport Corridor 8, which will unite Turkish and Italian ports, is an opportunity to boost regional co-operation, according to a joint declaration by officials from the project.

Bari and Brinian disciplinary ports in Italy are viewed as closed to the EU, while Turkish ports are also linked to the Kafkas Airport in Asia.
Many say a oil pipeline that will be removed from the sectors will reduce oil transportation costs to the EU.
The project is in different phases of construction.
A highway in Macedonia is not completed.
The railway line from Skopje to the Albanian border is completed, while the Bulgarian border is in the most construction of the Bulgarian border.
Bulgaria has no highway from Sofia to the Macedonian border, while the railway needs a connection with the Macedonian side.
Albania still needs to invest in the project.
Experts are calling for restructuring and modernisation efforts in Bulgaria and Albania to achieve a better exhibition capacity.
The EU and the Stability Pact have taken the financing of some parts of the monopoly.
Participants in Tirana expressed satisfaction with intensive co-operation and reform of governments in the region.
"The aim of the Corridor is not only to ensure a transport between the countries, but also to ensure that the people in the region, culture and economies can be completely integration with Euro-Atlantic structures," Macedonian Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva said.
The co-ordination could be more efficient, he said.
The meeting was decided to open a Corridor 8 secretary-General in Bari, Italy.
The secretary will be given the authorities to intensify inter-government co-operation.

With the pre-general elections in Serbia next year, political parties are now trying to punish voters, and various parties seek to reputate Belgrade from recognition of various parties.
The ruling coalition, led by President Boris Tadic &aposs Democratic Party, has suggested that employment and progress in the EU integration process is an example of successful policies.
The opposition, however, has criticised commitments that do not meet the ruling coalition, as well as the low standard of living and widespread corruption.
Public opinion analyst Srdjan Bogosavljevic emphasises that dissatisfaction could have a major impact on the voter participation in the next elections.
"The citizens are very happy.
The average average salary in Serbia has declined in the past three years.
There is a great change, but citizens do not know that they will vote from the current candidate airport. "
He believes the public expects more than political changes in 2000, and the disappointment of disappointment began.
Bogosavljevic expects the ruling coalition representatives "will not exercise the economic crisis in the next elections and that political amendment would" destabilise Serbia ".
Meanwhile, Bogosavljevic predicts that the opposition will focus on the poor economic situation to support the campaign.
He says that "nationalist interests" on the Kosovo issue ", as well as the opposition to the change of the public would be the boycott of the opposition.
"Kosovo does not have nothing to be used in serious tensions, and the situation is here, and it is a priority for economic and corruption."
"In the next campaign, the opposition will be much easier, because authorities will have to rise their criticism of what it must do, because they will have to do so to improve their life," Democratic Party spokesperson Jelena Trivan told SETimes.
The government can praise the economic recession, Trivan said.
In some EU countries, Serbia has not faced excessive debt to bankruptcy or international financial institutions.
"We will also emphasise our achievements in European integration, as well as in the fight against organised crime and implementing judicial reform," Trivan said.
According to most of the public opinion polls, the Serbian Progress Party (SNS), led by Tomislav Nikolic.
SNS official Marko Djuric said his party would focus on "deep and detailed change".
He added that the ruling coalition has repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly, while the majority of people contributed to the faculty.
"We will present a concrete programme in every area and in every part of the society.
We have announced the fight against corruption platform and we will present our plans in all other areas, especially the economy, "he said.
He expects the upcoming campaign to be a "idea" and see Tadic as the biggest political opponent to monitor the Democratic Party.
Bulgarian census data shows that the population lives
The census data is concerned about geographic trends and a disagreement on the country ’ s ethnic structure.
By Tzvetina Borisova for Southeast European Times in Sofia -- 09 / 08 / 11

According to the census, half a million people live in Bulgaria in 2001, less than 7.3 million.
"We have one of the worst situation in Europe, and a third of the public [lives]," Bulgarian Scientific Academy expert Emilsa Dimitrova told SETimes.
As a result, eastern rates are reduced, "he said.
The census data shows that the largest growth is in people -- at 65% -- from 16.8% in 2001 to 18.5% today.
Experts say the census decrease has been an ongoing trend for decades due to the negative birth rate, but the cases are a factor of foreign immigrants in one third.
The current pace will be less than 5.4 million by 2060.
This trend needs more resources to restore, but Dimitrova argues that "would continue to violence because the number of economic active people will decrease".
About a quarter of the census, or 1.7 million people are "working".
The majority of the census was the most controversial zone of the ethnic ethnicity and questioned that different political groups do not reflect the truth.
Many survive the number of Roma, despite traditional birth rates are being taken into account, and the consistent rates rose from 0.2% to 4.9% compared to 2001.
The possible reason is that it is based on the right to respond to the question of ethnic ethnicity, Dimitrova said, adding that many Roma are likely to see themselves as Bulgarian or other ethnic groups.
Roma continue to be the lowest ethnic community.
"The number of Roma is not true," United Roma Union President Zarko Chankov told SETimes.
"Many Roma are here to fear ethnic divisions, especially those who have achieved better education and society," Chankov said.
Chankov insists that the immigrants from abroad -- the other possible reason for immigration -- has not created a major effect, due to the Roma census can join the Internet.
Each Roma families have at least one in Bulgaria to show them when authorities visited their homes.
Tzvetozar Tomov is doubt of official figures.
"There are various evaluations and they say the declaration is two of the number of Roma in some," Tomov told SETimes.
The results of the census showed that the number of Turks, the second largest ethnic group, dropped to 8.8% of the population.
A civil society representative, who wants to remain secret of the organisation "for Umert", did not participate in the census data.
"If there is such a trend, it is likely to be from factors such as the immigration and farmers who have a citizenship," he told SETimes.
There are many people in the municipality, and some are likely to be in Bulgaria during the census census, "he said.
"Another factor is living.
In Kokcali, there are many people who live in the majority, "he added.
Macedonian society representatives said in a statement that the number of Macedonians showed that the number of Macedonians were low, claiming that the society does not recognise the results.
The census revealed that one of Bulgarians seemed higher education.
"This is a positive trend," Dimitrova said, adding that the education quality is a different issue.
Business polls say the education standard has dropped in the past 20 years.
For the first time, a human category -- 1.2% of the population -- or 81,000 people -- have been involved in the school.
Turkish arms producers aim to Middle East
Turkey seeks to represent weapons exports to diplomatic and economic policy
By Aaron Stein for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 09 / 08 / 11
Turkey has developed local weapons industry. [Reuters]
Turkey 'movement was the domestic weapons industry, the monitoring of an efficient Middle East export market.
For now, arms exports from the region are limited, but the private sector could lead to broad geopolitical and strategic effects that Turkey will become a key weapons exports.
The AKP has become a national priority to develop domestic weapons industry, and launched a policy to boost state investments in the local research and development sector in 2004.
It seems like this strategy -- Turkey was sold to the sale of about 1 billion weapons in 2010, with an increase of 200m in the beginning of 2000.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a campaign to turn Ankara into the centre of the defence industry.
This policy is an ambitious and important part of the AKP, the high technology service -- war aircraft, helicopter and cheapers -- that could be able to negotiate abroad.
"Turkey has a most developed defence industry and is now in a position to seek foreign markets.
The deepest military relations in Turkey will not only help further expansion of this industrial industry, but will also increase the influence of Turkey and its influence in the region.
Ankara is seeking to boost economic relations with its neighbours, such as tourism, agriculture, couple, farm, construction, health and transport.
This is part of a more comprehensive believe that economic dependence and regional stability would benefit Turkey 'economic and security situation.
"Turkey has made a real transition to the AKP administration of exports," he said, adding that Arab world and Iran are a food market for Turkey.
"The conservative past of the AKP has helped access to these markets where US, European and Eastern Asia are pressure," he said.
Nevertheless, Turkey has yet to receive military relations with the Middle East, and Turkish companies face challenges to compete with major exports such as the United States and European countries.
However, he believes "Turkey will invest more in the coming years".
Aram Nerguian, a columnist professor at the Centre for Strategic and International Security Security, argues that one of the main motivations to boost military co-operation with the Golden countries is "the United States, for example, as well as the United States, as well as the United States, to make itself a complicated player as possible, but in order to make it possible."
"If Turkey can make its role and leadership in the Middle East, it could offer a convinced reason for Turkey to join the EU.
In addition, the Middle East countries can see Si as a potential role in Iran, a growing role in the region, "he said.
However, he opposed, "Turkey has its own own reasons for the Middle East, and that the United States and the EU are not aware of how Turkey can see its relations with the Middle East," he said.
However, disadvantage of the region could bring Ankara 'efforts to enter the Middle East market complicated.
Turkey has been resolved with Syria, and Turkish initiatives seem to see trade interests.
Meanwhile, weakness relations with Israel, a key weapons producer, have also been involved in military co-operation.
"At a time when conservative Arab monarches are focused on the internal stability and mutual right of the Arab monarches, Turkey 'role has been repeated," Nerguizian said.
Greek arrangements short sale by October
In recent days, panic has been affected by global markets has caused the decline of world debt, including several Balkan countries.
(Various sources -- 05 / 08 / 11 - 09 / 08 / 11)
The shares at the Athens Stock Exchange have been the lowest level for more than 14 years. [Reuters]
A two-month law on sale at the Athens Stock Exchange took effect on Tuesday (August 9th), after the debt 'main index was the lowest levels of more than 14 years.
Following his decision on Monday, the Greek stock company, the Greek Service Powers Commission, announced that the move has caused extraordinary conditions and will remain in force until October 7th.
"Following the managing board of the capital markets, the board of emergency conditions in the Greek market, the Athens debt has decided to ban short sales in the list," Reuters quoted the commission as saying.
In the sale, the sale does not want to have a shareholder, but it is sold to sell its debt, and it is expected to purchase a lower price, with the expectation of the value.
The Greek arrangement decided after the Athens general detention dropped 6% at a session Monday, citing a psychological score of 1,000 psychological points for the first time since January 1997.
This was the third application for such a measure since the global financial crisis explored in late 2008.
According to commission officials, most of the short sale activities were foreign investors on Monday.
"We have seen an increase in the sale stock excavations, and the marathinal sales from short poets have created reality on the market," the Financial Times quoted Anastassios Gabrielides, head of the board, as telling the Financial Times.
The law could be removed before October 7th, he said.
Last week, the latest decline reflects the development of a recent survey, including the United States' highest AAA rating, Standard and Poor (S) & P rating.
The decline took place in the mid-day crisis, which has increased concerns in the Eurozone and other members of the 17-nation club, except of Greece, Iran and Portugal, could also increase the needs of rescue aid.
Only days after an agreement reached on July 21st on a new 109 billion-euro bailout package for Greece, fears that Italy and Spain, the third largest and fourth largest EU countries used by the euro, could withdraw the region 'expansion crisis.
Politicians have not been successful in a series of measures aimed at convincing that the eurozone can deal with the ongoing crisis.
The S & P & P 'announcement last week stopped not only the Greek debt, but also noted other markets on Monday, including Bulgaria, Serbia and Turkey.
The three countries seemed to be the most affected country, at least in Bulgaria, when the main PAFIC blueprint wrapped up to 2.3907% in the session of the session.
Serbian and Turkish markets have shared the largest coup in the past three years.
The Serbian municipality 'Mayor 15 index wrapped up about 5.9% during the closure Monday, citing 639.33 points.
The trust of the investors' confidence has been sparked by 7.1% in Turkey 'biggest decline since October 2008, with the lowest score of 52.44, the lowest since March of last year.
Furthermore, Ragmen Still RS Co-operation in War Crimes
Although the RS government has been met as a positive step towards accepting the Srebrenica massacre, there is no doubts that the country must fulfil its international obligations.

The families of the Srebrenica victims say the RS government is not enough. [AFP]
Following several years after Republika Srpska passed the Srebrenica massacre last month, the government was officially named from the victims' families on the website.
The Bosnian Serb leadership officials, however, convinced the international community is ready to co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.
"The RS government acknowledges the excavations of the Srebrenica victims of the Srebrenica victims, and it is a great discourse of traffic," he writes.
He is part of an official response to the entity government 'report by the Srebrenica Commission.
"In July 1995, the report found that international humanitarian laws in the Srebrenica region are convinced with violent violations of international humanitarian crimes, and no doubt.
The RS government is determined to surrender all individuals committed to war crimes, and it is taking concrete measures in this direction, "the RS government said.
The Srebrenica Commission was formed after the Srebrenica victims did not provide information about their families' members of the RS government, and the 49 application application was adopted by the BiH Human Rights Prosecutor.
The move ordered RS to respond to the necessary answers, in March 7th 2003.
Following the final report, the international Office of the High Representative (OHR) pressure and the commission came after the reconstruction of a Bosniak and international experts.
The victims of victims, who said the RS government was satisfied with the announcement, said it is insufficient to meet the obligations of the entity.
"We have no autonomy with the international community.
We want to see that those responsible for this crimes are transferred to justice, "he said.
While welcoming the OHR and the EU mission in BiH, RS officials have welcomed the report, urging RS authorities to arrest war crimes indictees, as well as to take steps to identify massive losses and identify victims.
In a report to the UN Security Council last month, UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised RS authorities for failing to arrest a single suspect in nine years since the end of the 1992-1995 conflict.

Serbia-Montenegro Council of Ministers Civilian Military Administration
As part of the new resolution, conservative owners will be able to fulfil their military service in civil enterprises.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 29 / 09 / 03
The decision to bring Serbia-Montenegro civilian military service will take effect on October 15th.
The Council of Ministers approved the measure as response to two years set by the Council of Europe (CoE), which Serbia-Montenegro joined earlier this year.
The decision will be applied by 2004, when a new law would be passed with a major cause.
As the Serbia-Montenegro defence minister is determined by the Serbia-Montenegro defence minister, controversial owners will also be able to fulfil their military service, health companies, institutions and other institutions operating in the benefit of public benefits.
However, it is insufficient to meet international standards.
The CoE recommends that the civilian and armed service will be successful, but teachers have to serve 13 months under the legitimate direction, while their service has been limited to only nine months.
About 333.00 soldiers in the Serbia-Montenegro Army have been rejected by only 44 soldiers.
The armed forces will not jeopardise the need of troops, military officials said.
According to military sources, the number of conservative owners has increased in the past few years, but those who have to complete military service are only a small scale.
As part of the new system, civil service demands will not be accepted.
Instead, special commissions that will be appointed by the defence minister must be approved.
These commissions will include a psychologist, a psychologist, a doctor and two military representatives.
If the aim, the conservative owner will be simple.
For example, the council will question whether the obligation is really members of a catastrophic that banned weapons and use, or whether it is really true against weapons.
This will be clear that the obligation will apply for any license for weapons, and if it does not apply to control.
According to terrorists, the obligation will be sent to a civilian institution.
The provisional civilian status will have to comply with the rules of the institution, which was appointed.

The United States and Montenegro signed an agreement Tuesday (May 1st) to open the way for improving bilateral military co-operation.
The agreement, known as the status Agreement (SOFA), was signed by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Montenegrin President Filip Vujanovic in August, less than nine months after the formation of diplomatic relations.
Montenegro declared independence on June 3rd 2006.
Two weeks ago, most of the 630,000 voters over the Adriatic republic supported the country 'secession with Serbia, which was formed in 2003.
"The United States is a friendly and partner, Montenegro as a common partner in the Balkans," Rice said at a joint press conference with Vujanovic.

"The signing of the SOFA agreement is a new basis for our relations with the primary values and that Montenegro is a safe environment, which is why the new economic partners are a new case to form new economic partners," he said.

Romania Says Arab Programme
The average average of cars in Romania is 13.5 and most of them are in fulfilling security and security standards of the West.
Authorities have launched a national campaign to encourage citizens to renew their vehicles, but critics say more must be done to meet EU rules.

About half more than 12 years ago, the registered 3.8 million vehicles in Romania.
Most have been produced at the Dacia, Bytcit and Aro factories, which are more than in the West 'security and security standards.
Some of the former cars have been imported from Western Europe after the communist era, but their views are not good.
About 350,000 car cars are over 20.
This 1.6 million vehicles are seen as a potential threat to traffic safety and the reason for air pollution.
"The average of the vehicles in life is 13.5 per cent.
We cannot be banned because such a decision has led to serious social consequences.
But we have to protect the quality of the narcotics, "he said.
Authorities began steps on the issue.
As part of a swimming programme launched by the ministry, dozens of vehicles will be able to bring them to shells for 930 euros.
This money can only be used for a new car.
However, the programme does not have its own problems.
The money from the programme is under way to get a new car -- the most cheapest car is over 4,000 euros.
The average monthly salary is 185 euros, with an average pension salary of 62 euros, is not the situation that many in a country where the average pension is 62 euros.
Many use the former car because it is not another option.
Some of them go to the way to sell former vehicles who want the government programme.
This caused a significant increase of former car prices.
"I can only sell Btcit, a 15 years ago, but I can sell it to 100,000, but now I sell it with a witness.
"I am happy and I will represent Renault Clio '."
The programme critics say it is used to increase public sales for new car sales, since it is not a modern regain in in Romania, and without creating the restructuring system.
"This is not an enforcement of EU regulations. It will not have an important effect on the airport, but some will produce a large amount of amounts," former environmental ministry expert Catalin Gurau Capital said in an interview with the former environment ministry.
Another obstacle is insufficient.
The programme was only 12m euros, and this means only 14,000 former car cars, only 1 per cent of the number of targets will be eliminated.
Nevertheless, officials say the programme will continue in the next year if it is successful.

"EUFOR has 23 helicopters that can be transferred into a single season," Leakey said. "These helicopters have a broad use of transplants, and they can be able to work on a day, and many weapons can work.
These are not only the air square for soldiers or the airline. "
Some EUFOR helicopters are frozen near the BiH border, Leakey said, in a bid to bring the video of different organised crime activities.
Most EUFOR operations are under way in co-operation with local law enforcement agencies.
"Organised crime and corruption are a problem that affects everyone in this country," he said. "Supreme networks and parallel structures are undermining stability, growth and prosperity in BiH.
These are jeopardising the progress of this country towards European integration. "
Addressing the role of these networks to bring war crimes indictees to justice, Leakey added that BiH will not benefit from EU and NATO membership without full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal.
"The co-operation is that all war crimes indictees, including Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, are surrender to The Hague," Leakey said.

Romania has a high-profile region, but the major part of the city structures can be based on a strong earthquake.
Authorities hope to solve the problem before the World Bank is helping.

More than 3,400,000 structures in Romania between 1992 and 2000 have been assessed by discrimination against the earthquake.
The 578,000 believed to be the highest earthquake risk by experts, is likely to fall over 6.0, according to the Richter forum.
Most of the buildings in the Supreme risk class have created the bloc, while some serve as restaurant, theatre scandal or store.
Furthermore, 67 hospitals in the 55 city -- three of the four emergency assistance hospitals in Bucharest -- are on the list.
This is a major disaster of the victims' question that victims will be invited.
Among the potential dangerous buildings in Merisoara, one of the largest cities in Romania, only five hospitals, not only five hospitals, but the environment buildings and the emergency situation.
The problem of the Romanian defense, which is in the earthquake activities, is particularly urgent.
"According to our estimates, the next largest earthquake on 6.5 violence in Romania will take place in the next two to three years," said Gheorghe Marnreanu, head of the Institute for District Foundation in Magurele.
Meanwhile, the World Bank expert Gabriel Ionita Gardianul said Bucharest is "the largest in the European capital and the world, which is in danger of earthquake".
More than 1,000 people were killed in the earthquake of the bloc, which was built before World War II.
Experts believe that "disappointment", which has not been able to fall its name, is under risk of 17,000 people who live in the buildings.
The government has pledged to do everything in the past 13 years.
However, only 23 of the buildings under the high risk of risk have been sparked, one of them in 20.
Authorities received the necessary money for strengthening 47 other countries, including 40 in central Bucharest this year.
According to the government, work on the rest will begin by the end of next year.
"There are about 150m euros for strengthening all buildings in the system," said Minister of Protection Laszlo Bordey.
The revenue of a 155m-euro loan from the World Bank is expected to meet the major part of the costs.
However, the owners in the risk are expected to take their fans.
The law envisions the state budget to help families only 165 euros a month.
Others need to pay payments within 25 years if they dropped them.
Many are unable to pay the money, despite concrete danger that they face.

Dayton Peace Agreement
After Slovenia and Croatia leaved from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (YFC) in 1990 and 1991, a referendum was held on February 29th and March 1st 1992 for independence.
Bosnian Muslims and Croats have supported BiH from the federal federation, while Bosnian Serbs boycotted the majority of votes. In April 5th 1992, the national parliament declared that BiH was leaving in the YFC.
Following this case and hundreds of thousands of thousands of people died, the war has been the most prominent in Europe since World War II.
Following many successful efforts to sign a peacekeeping agreement, the United States launched a new initiative in the spring of the 1995 autumn of the United States, about three and a half years after the start of violence.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic met on November 1st 1995 at the West Patterson Airport in Ohio, the town of Dayton, on 1 November 1995.
During the talks, US Deputy Foreign Minister Richard Holbrooke led the presidency.
Representatives of the Contact Group, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, have also been ready for these frequent talks on the American air base.
Milosevic, Tudjman and Izetbegovic reached an agreement on 21 weeks after the start of the talks, ordering the General Stabilisation Agreement in BiH.
Following the end of the Dayton Peace Accord (DBA), the document was officially signed by the three Balkan countries in Paris on December 14th 1995.
Among the leaders participated in the signing ceremony were UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, NATO Secretary General Bill Clinton, French President Jacques Chirac, British Prime Minister John Major, German Chancellor Hellent Kohl and Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomir.
The ceremony represented the EU as the former prime minister of Sweden and the head of the Dayton peacekeeping conference, Carl Bildt.
"Today, we are convincing the victims' victims' death in peacekeepers -- the men 'children who have turned the death of the deaths, murder of young people who were killed in hundreds of deaths, murdered in the killings of hundreds of people and their families.
These victims are accompanied by these peacekepers.
"We are in our hands and our actions," he said.
The DBA is 11th, organised by peacekeeping decisions and regional stability issues, military, political and civilian aspects.
Under the agreement, BiH, a sovereignty state of two entities, including Muslim and Croats' Federation of BiH and the Bosnian Serb entity, was set to be set up with international and inter-entity borders.
DBA Ek was part of the BiH constitution in 4.
The DBA is a condition for BiH, Croatia and the YFC to respect equal sovereignty rights and resolve disagreements with peaceful methods.
The weeks signed the accord, enabling human rights to respect the rights of refugees and displaced citizens.
In addition, peacekeeping decisions have agreed to be fully co-operated with all entities and enterprises who are working to investigate the investigation of other actions that violate the international humanitarian law.
A day after the DBA was signed in Paris, the UN Security Council has ordered the military requirements to implement the agreement with Karar, 1031, with the NATO Security Council. On December 20th 1995, the NATO Implementation Force (IFOR), which was the largest military operation in BiH, has so far met.
After a year of authority, the Stabilisation Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR in December 1996.
SFOR, about 32,000 soldiers, has been dropped in time. About 7,000 soldiers were dropped by December 2004, when the European Union for the European Union was set to EUFOR.
The mandate for implementation of the DBA civil circumstances was made by the High Representative in BiH (YT).
The Office of the High Representative, who is working with the UN Security Council, is serving as the top representative of the international community in the Balkan country, and has high authority, such as the law.
The mandate of the High Representative is to facilitate and co-ordinate its work, including the process of implementation of peacekeeping decisions.
The Dayton Accord was successful to revive peacekeeping in BiH and has achieved it, but also established one of the most complicated government systems in the world.
The arrangement is not assessed as a sustainable system in the long term of many in BiH and abroad.
The Centre institutions are weakly weakened, and the two sides of the entity are still difficult to recognise the country as a state of international administration. At a ceremony in Washington on November 22nd, representatives of the three entities promised that BiH will make a historic date for the future peacekeeping and prosperity.

So far, the negotiators have opened 21 of the total 35 chapters, or policy areas that have taken the negotiation process and closed four.
"The progress Croatia has made by the end of 2009 should be possible to reach the final phase of accession talks," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
However, Turkey, which began talks in October 2005, has only opened eight negotiating chapters so far and closed a witness as provisional.
The EC has criticised the pace of political reforms in Turkey, but recognised the country as one of the key economic criteria as a "functioning market economy".
It also praised Ankara for example of active and "constructive" foreign policy in the Caucasus.
Macedonia, an official EU candidate in December 2005, has not been the green light to start accession talks.
The country still guarantees free and fair elections and must improve dialogue between the main political parties and legislation, the EC said.
In the EC reports, candidate countries and five potential candidates -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia -- have been calling for moving against corruption in the region, which is still widespread.
Serbia has made some progress in developing a comprehensive anti-corruption policy in this area, the EC said.
The country could win an official EU candidate country next year if its priority political and economic reforms, as well as concrete progress in co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
"Serbia must do everything that is going to arrest the remaining ICTY indictees, including Ratko Mladic," Rehn said.
The EC said Albania, BiH and Montenegro have made progress in implementing the Interim Agreement.
These countries still need to reinforce the rule of law and administrative executives.
The EC urged Albania to carry out its 2009 elections in line with international standards, and urged Montenegro to exercise an aggressive judiciary reform.
The EC also expressed concern about the rise of nationalism in BiH in recent months.
While widespread corruption and organised crime, the EC said the country is "a early phase" for European integration.
Montenegro still does not agree on its constitution
Montenegrin citizens elected independence in a referendum last May, 88 years after Serbia.
However, the adoption of the new constitution is now under way.

The parliamentary commission, which has drafted Montenegro &aposs new constitution, met on Tuesday (January 16th) after opposition members refused to join.
However, there is no sign of a broad compromise.
The ruling and opposition parties have not reached an agreement on many issues, such as the country 'official language, the right to vote abroad, and that Montenegro should not be defined as a "ultimately state".
The ruling Socialist Democratic Party (DPS) wants the constitution to adopt any initiative that could cause Montenegro to become a state, while the pro-Serbian opposition wants to continue a referendum on regaining a state union with Serbia in the future.
"The government is trying to advance the current situation by eliminating the possibility of the citizens to decide different decision," said Velizar Kalucerovic, a senior official of the Montenegrin Socialist People (SNP).
The SNP also wants the right to vote on Montenegrin citizens, who are living in Serbia and most opposed to the end of the state union.
The government faces resistance, particularly the pro-Serbian opposition, in particular, on the formal dismiss of "Montenegro".
Opposition argued that 63% of the census in 2003 speaks to Serbian, but only 26% say Montenegro speaks.
The Bosniak parties, meanwhile, want to change the military university and change of the flag to the Islamic tradition.
"We do not agree that the state symbols of the minorities should not recognise that the minorities do not allow them to see them.
Some symbols are reluctant, "he said.
The DPS and Social Democratic Party (SDP) pushed a "huge abroad" to protect Montenegro as a sovereignty citizens, while Bosniak and Serbian lawmakers say the new constitution should not recognise Montenegro as a communities.
According to them, Bosniaks and Serbs should be part of the constitution of the Montenegrin state.
However, the DPS says it could cause a request for a secession.
Under the law, the constitution must vote in parliament for a two-thirds majority to be accepted.
If only a slow majority -- the ruling owners must be approved by a referendum.
"There is a broad consensus on the constitution.
If the new constitutional forces, NGOs and the public, we cannot reach a debate, "he said.
Montenegro wants to join the CoE, but it must stop the constitution before.
The CoE requests Montenegro to "recognise as a state abroad and to" increase judicial independence "and increase judicial independence, the Podgorica daily Vijesti reported on Wednesday.
Political analyst Milos Besic says a compromise would be reached at the end of, but that the EU could need to intervene.
"Some of the European institutions are likely to have some mediator under the principles of reconciliation.
During the talks, some secret intervention could be intervened during the talks, "he said.
Albanian parties to attend elections in Serbia
The two South Serbia Albanian parties submitted a joint candidate for the parliamentary elections Sunday.
This could be the beginning of the interethnic Albanians' return to the political life of Serbia.

Two of the South Serbian parties -- the Democratic Action Party and the Vadi Democratic Union of Democratic Action -- submitted a joint candidate for the parliamentary elections on Sunday (January 21st).
This will be the first participation in the parliamentary elections since 1993, when Albanians living in Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja municipalities in southern Serbia.
The two parties will participate in the elections as a Albanian coalition from the Presevo Vision, which Albanians give the south of Serbia.
He said the coalition expects to win two of the 250 seats in parliament.
"We will defend a better life for Albanians by improving security at the Presevo Valley, improving the economy and the legal and political status of Albanians," he said.
Jonz Musliu, a representative of Albanians who did not participate in the elections, said the conditions have not been material.
Serbia has yet to reach a sufficient decentralisation, Musliu said.
According to Musliu, the armed conflict in Presevo and Bujanovac was not fully implemented between Albanians and Serbian authorities in May 2001.
Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku called last month to vote abroad in southern Serbia.
"We must be involved in all processes that helped develop democracy, including the January elections," Ceku said.
According to analysts, Albanians' participation could increase pressure on Belgrade to recommend Kosovo Serbs to the KOova institutions.
International officials have criticised Belgrade for not encouraging this direction.
First Serbian politicians welcomed the Albanians' decision to join.
Serbian Prime Minister Vosjislav Kostunica said that the ethnic Albanian minority would benefit all countries, including the other ethnic minorities.
The Democratic Party (DP), led by Serbian President Boris Tadic, welcomed the Albanians' decision.
"We want them to co-operate with the majority political parties in the government, various institutions and the executive force," DP spokesman Jelena Markovic said.
About 58,000 Albanians live in municipalities in South Serbia.
Many live in Presevo, where the population created 90% of the population.

"We want the democratic forces to win the elections in Serbia to continue on its path to the EU and NATO," Basescu said.
At a news conference in Rome on Tuesday, European Commission Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said he expects "a reformist in Belgrade and a pro-European government would make progress towards the EU".
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt and Slovenian Foreign Minister Jan Kubisner, who visited Belgrade earlier this week, said Serbia has made support for the EU bid.
"We will respect the decision of voters in Serbia, but we hope that this will be a government that we will be very fast, very deeply and very constructive talks on all integration issues," the AP quoted Bildt as saying Monday.
In Washington, Foreign Minister for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried voiced hope that pro-European parties in Serbia will win.
"We want to see Europe as a European future for itself," Fried said in an interview with the VOA. "Serbia is doing it."
The Serbian people are insisting any public in Europe that a future in Europe, "he said.
EC offers new energy package
The European Commission announced a comprehensive energy plan, new and broad energy plan, covering six key projects for reducing energy security and the Union 'dependence on Russian energy imports.
(FT, Euobserver, EurActiv, Guardian - 14 / 11 / 08; AFP, DPA, BBC, Euobserver, The Times, European Commission - 13 / 11 / 08)
"We must protect European citizens, foreign supplies to the risk of failing to fulfil their obligations," EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said. [Getty Images]
The European Commission (EC) revealed an ambitious plan, which includes improving the EU energy security and efficiency of efficiency and measures to reduce its dependence on oil and gas imports from Russia.
About 54 per cent of the EU 'most energy needs are being excepted from foreign resources.
Russia imports 61 per cent of natural gas, and 42 per cent of the amount imported imports are Russia.
Local gas production is expected to continue to decrease, while the EC estimates that gas imports from 2020 will reach 73 per cent.
The commission, published on November 13th, said energy imports were estimated by 350 billion euros in prices of this year, and that figure means 700 euros for each EU citizens.
EC President Jose Manuel Barroso, who presented the Energy package, stressed that the average increase in energy prices in the 27-nation bloc was only 15 per cent last year.
"We need to disappoint this part of energy consumption and increasing imports," Barroso said.
According to Barroso, eight EU countries are completely dependent on natural gas to Russia, the Union must be a problem that must be addressed.
"We have to protect European citizens, foreign supplies to the risk of failing to fulfil their obligations," the EC chief said.
The dispute between Russia and Ukrainian gas supplies has been caused in 2006, with some EU countries to simple natural gas supplies, and the Union was asked to take a step towards further diversification of energy resources and supplies.
In August, the clash in the Caucasus showed that Europe is the safety of Russian resources.
The EU must take emergency measures to increase energy efficiency and reduce its dependence on imports, Barroso said, urging countries to accept the EC to accept new bids.
"I have to do and we must diversify our resources," Barroso said.

The plan stressed that the Union must focus more on infrastructure needs and improve energy resources, ensuring oil and gas stations, creating a crisis mechanisms to improve possible gas cuts, to create better use of local energy resources and improve energy efficiency.
The first priority in the Strategic Energy Report is the adoption of the measures that would allow the Union to bring its targets of 20-20 climate change, according to the EC statement.
The EU aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, reducing wind energy, solar energy and other renewable energy resources to 20 per cent of the final energy consumption and increase energy efficiency.
"In the coming years, there will be significant changes in the EU energy infrastructure, in order to ensure that the 20-20 targets of the EU will guarantee electricity and gas supplies for all EU citizens," the EC said in a statement.
The report includes six strategic projects that are crucial for EU energy security: the Baltic Arab Arab gas Plan, southern gas supplies, the Mediterranean energy line, Central and Southeast Europe, the North Mediterranean natural gas network and electricity links to the North Sea Sea and Europe.
If the governments of the countries and the European Parliament approved the package, the Baltic Arabian link Plan will begin next year.
The project, which includes gas, electricity and details, will connect the networks in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to other parts of the EU.
Three Baltic countries, which are the most Russian energy networks, are among the eight EU member states that have fulfilled natural gas needs from Russia.
In addition to the "one of the most important priorities for the EU energy security", the EC said it would be built for the pipelines to transport oil and gas from the Caspian and the Middle East, as part of the project.
The Mediterranean energy pipeline, which will connect electricity and gas links to Europe, should now be completed ", the EC said, noting that the project is" to develop the "major potential that the region has a solar and wind energy".

The EU 'administrative scene has also asked the north to create a plan for the North Sea Sea, which would connect the national electricity networks of European countries and enable the implementation of various open wind energy projects planned.
The EC said this open Mediterranean network will be "one of the fundamental aspects of the future European percentage network".
The EC has vowed to use the existing vehicles for progress in the six projects to be made quickly, stressing that all sides in the third countries, including organisations in the third countries, need to be a serious precedent for the implementation of projects.
"This work is a basic element of the EU response to the current financial crisis, and it must be accelerated to promote employment and the reduction of the demand," the commission said.
The EC also invested a series of new proposals on energy efficiency, including revising EU laws on the energy efficiency of buildings and energy use.
Without all new buildings and important renewal studies, the EC said it could provide new efficiency standards for existing buildings, which could provide 5-6 per cent energy austerity by 2020.
The commission asked the Union to compensate rules for energy class -- not only the house of households -- including different products used by energy.
The same legal arrangement will be defined for car car fans, and fears will be defined, according to fuel efficiency.
The commission believes that consumers will be able to reduce gas supplies by leaving better vehicles.
The EC also plans to invest in implementing minimum requirements for the street and labour, street and other electricity equipment, and to invest in a bid to bring the Union to compliance with the targets of energy and climate change.

As Serbia signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU ahead of the April 2008 parliamentary elections, authorities in Belgrade did not expect four years to receive candidate status.
The ruling coalition, led by Serbian President Boris Tadic, described the pace of the European integration process as a target, but was adopted by Belgrade in February 2008 as a province of Serbia, which was accepted by Belgrade as a province of Serbia.
Serbia removed hundreds of hours before the EU decision on Thursday (March 1st).
Serbian and Romanian officials have reached an agreement on the UK minority in Serbia, and this would be able to withdraw the conditions that Bucharest has made in Belgrade.
The details of the agreement, which includes about 30,000 people living in the Romanian border, have not been announced.
The decision was announced by Council of Europe President Herman Van Rompuy.
"I hope that this will encourage Serbia to boost efforts to fulfil the political and economic conditions for EU membership.
I hope that Belgrade will continue to support regional co-operation and good neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans, "he said.
Serbian officials welcomed the status quo.
Tadic said his candidacy would "open the door" to economic progress, but in front of Serbia, it is "very work" to take steps towards EU membership.
The decision was sent to international community and foreign investors, and is a message that Serbia is "on the path of a regular European country", said Laslo Varga, head of the Serbian Parliament &aposs European Integration Committee.
"This will stop a decrease of support for the candidate status status in the country and will also create new opportunities to use the money for the European pre-accession funds," he told SETimes.
However, Vladimir Radomirovic of the Centre for Strategic Alternal Affairs said Serbia cannot win many things from the candidacy, because the money from European funds can only be used for specific structures.
"Serbia has not won nothing in implementing the EU candidate status," Radomirovic told SETimes.
The poor economic situation is essential and the political corruption cannot be prevented, "he said.
All parties in Serbia do not think it is a good way to join the EU.
The opposition Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), the opposition Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, said that the best for Serbia is to declare political discrimination, stop European integration and exercise economic relations with the Union.
DSS spokesman Petar Petkovic told SETimes that Serbia has lost more than 500m euros in implementing the SAA.
"Instead of losing EU membership, Serbia must establish a developed economic co-operation with all countries in the world, through political instability," Petkovic said.
And everyone know that the next step in the process of Serbia is to start EU membership talks and that means new, heavy consequences.
He believes that Serbia is a realistic expectation for this history in December, due to the difficult tasks in need to be difficult and economic problems in its own part of the EU.
"Belgrade will be asked to fulfil all agreements with Pristina, and a request for the implementation of institutions in northern Kosovo.
I do not think that the next step towards the EU will be easy, "he said.
Radomirovic agrees.
"According to EU officials, Serbia could be able to start negotiations in December.
So far, the main EU countries will require Belgrade 'positive behaviour to Kosovo, and it will not require Serbian institutions, especially those in northern Kosovo, "he said.
The citizens of Serbia on the EU candidacy have different views.
Belgrade car Milovan Brkic, 33, said the candidacy is good news.
"We have become closer to the EU, and this could only be better in both economic and politically," Brkic told SETimes.
Milena Srdic, 30, does not agree.
"Now do you know better?
What will we increase us?
I do not believe that the EU has great financial problems, "he said.
Serbia has received candidate status, but Macedonia and Montenegro, which has a candidate status since 2005 and 2010.
Croatia is preparing to join the Union in mid-2013, while Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the SAA in 2008.
This week, the Union gave the green light for a feasibility study for Kosovo.
Ashdown
The European Commission has recently approved the Bosnia and Herzegovina Feasibility Study and must fulfil the 16 conditions in BiH by the end of June 2004, when NATO is ready to invite the country to join the Partnership for Peace programme.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo -- 26 / 12 / 03
In a recent speech to the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), High Representative Paddy Ashdown stressed the importance of the six months of next month that the country is on the prospects for a possible future in the EU and NATO.
"If the second half of the next half of the year is not enough, Europe will have to be ready," Ashdown said.
The European Commission will not be a position to propose a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
The feasibility Study has made it clear.
And if the treasury is not successful, this point is wrong.
This is the reason for the coming months to be important. "
Last month, the European Commission (EC) approved a Feasibility Study aimed at evaluating whether BiH is ready to take the necessary steps for integration into Europe, which began talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
While BiH has made significant progress since the 1990s, it points to the fight against serious weaknesses.
The EC hopes to propose the launch of SAA talks next year if BiH has made significant progress in 16 areas defined as a priority actions. It is hoping to propose a more effective management of the existing international obligations, an effective public administration of European integration, particularly effectively effectively effectively effectively effectively, the fight against human rights and corruption, and a lack of tax reform, especially in particular,
The 16 requirements include several economic reforms in the field of rule of law, three media areas in the field of rule of law and a economic reform in co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
"In the next year, I am very satisfied with the member states that they can start SAA talks with BiH," EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Chris Patten said. "I can make it serious and short efforts in areas where we have not recognised BiH.
Following the domestic political will, there is no reason for BiH to reach this goal, "he said.
At the same time on December 4th, NATO welcomed the progress BiH has made in recent years, when the State Defence Assembly approved by parliament and the adoption of the BiH Armed Forces under state commander and control of the BiH Armed Forces.
The Alliance has now stressed that BiH must implement the Defence Law on Defence, so that it can receive an invitation to join the Partnership for Peace programme (PfP) at the summit in Istanbul in June 2004.
The arrest of war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic remains an important precondition for PfP membership.
"There are many important decisions and a huge job that will be taken today," Ashdown said in a diplomatic forum in Sarajevo recently. "This is a meanwhile, this should not be a long time for some provisional steps that have been delayed.
This is the time of the country.
If BiH does not fulfil the conditions set by determined, it will be asked to avoid this opportunity, "he said.

Lehne stressed that the UN needs to continue implementing standards set for Kosovo.
Kosovo institutions have made great progress, but "they will do more," Lehne said.
Asked to comment on a certain solution on the future of Kosovo, Lehne said the type will be clarified after the Contact Group meeting on November 10th.
"I think we can know more about the agenda after November 10th," Lehne said. "We have not been decided to see a clear decision so far."

By Kristina Cuk for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 15 / 06 / 06
The number of people living in poverty has not changed in the past decade, despite the increasing GDP in Croatia.
The number of people who live under the poverty border has not changed since 1999, although Croatia has been doubt over the past decade.
According to government data, the Croatian economy grew from the average of EU member states, but the number of people living in poverty are the same.
Regional social assistance in Croatia are only 55 euros a month due to funding.
The social minimum, which means almost 500,000 Croats, or a family must live in order to live without major discrimination, due to the low and salaries of pensions.
Most people live in rural areas and are working with their territory.
Many are not seen in accordance with aid.
About 2 per cent of GDP -- half the only personal families are spent.
A third of the rest is going to children and inhumanitarian families.
About 40 years of social aid are about 40.
More than 40 per cent of the aid areas did not finish the principles, one third of the primary school education, and a quarter of three.
Regional meanwhile, Croatia has no more poor than its north and the north of the country.
More than 70 per cent of the minutes have met in central and eastern Croatia.
The biggest number of inspectors live in areas that have damaged the conflict in the 1990s.
The government is now working on developing a National Health Strategy that will restore the social prosperity system as a fight against poverty and social exception.
The new criteria have come to financial assistance from the state and depends on the property situation, and the current system is closing its liquidities.
For example, a hotel or company has only 214 euros a month, but a person who had only 214 euros, had the right to help if the need.
"Therefore, a number of goods is one of the model for new social policy," said Health and Social Affairs Minister Neven Ljubicic.
Under the planned reform framework, each citizens will be given a state assistance.
The citizens will have to show all revenues and property that they have.
Authorities will determine whether no one will receive financial assistance.
Croatia has a 7,000-euro GDP.
Despite these figures, the country still has a stable social policy.
Many believe the EU aid will solve the problem, according to Croatia, as it is a candidate country.
IMF to assess the pace of change in Serbia
As part of an agreement with the IMF, Serbia has promised to restore inflation, tight money and fiscal policy monitoring and restructuring in public enterprises.
A mission of the Fund is now in Belgrade to see how progress has been made.

A IMF mission led by Peter Doyle is in Belgrade for a two-week visit.
The goal of the visit is to see how the Serbian government has made progress in meeting the current agreement with the Fund, which is currently 15.5 per cent of inflation -- the highest rate of Europe -- more difficult fiscal and monetary policies and accelerating structural reforms.
All of them were suggested at the next monitoring programme, which is determined to hold a three-year arrangement.
Belgrade has agreed to launch major reforms, such as the restructuring and restructuring of public enterprises (or closure), in exchange of 700m euros from the Paris Club, which is created by countries.
According to the Fund, these changes are to create a more efficient investment climate.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica and Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic, however, do not include a new arrangement with the Fund, as they agree that "there is no time".
Such statements are concerned by economists.
Experts are concerned that the current government, which has left about half of its mandate, is trying to win the foresee stage, as it comes to implementation of business reforms.
Authorities and the IMF are likely to see such a effort.
A few months ago, Dinkic said the new arrangement should not be proposed until Montenegro &aposs status is decided.
The referendum was held in May and Montenegro is now independent, but it was not yet a letter from Belgrade.
"I am not able to understand that I have not been sent," Central Bank Governor Radovan Jelasic said.
Former finance ministers Bozidar Delic believes the IMF is very needed.
"What is more labour money, the policy policies and experience is not in charge.
In the future, Serbia will have a fragile coalition government, which is working under daily pressure and will not prepare the 21st century, "he said.
In such a climate, pressure from international financial institutions could be very important to make any things.
Michael Steiner to Kosovo
UNMIK chief Michael Steiner congratulated a congratulation at the PDK centre in Pristina on July 7th, with leader of the Democratic Party of Kosovo Hashim Thaci (right).
Steiner was removed at 8 months after the UN mission in Kosovo was executed as chief of the UN mission in Kosovo. [AFP] Michael Steiner said he was proud of the multiethnic climate that he was prepared to leave Kosovo, while the head of the presidency was proud.

The United Militaries Mission for Kosovo (UNMIK) chief Michael Steiner will replace Steiner after Kosovo on July 8th.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has yet to announce that he is considering the new Special Representative.
As Annan is certain that he would use his preference from his preference, UNMIK deputy chief Charles Brayshaw will be appointed by the US deputy, as he is not the head of his post.
Steiner repeatedly convinced the truth feasibility of the Kosovo status quo and surprised the invitations.
"We know that the status quo of the real philosophistic philosophy is very good," Steiner said, adding that the bridge was a bridge approach.
The former UNMIK chief argued that after his mandate in the region, democratic standards must be met and created by the establishment of institutions operating in a door.
"It is the first time to come here," said Steiner, who said the environment in Kosovo.
This is the most beautiful evidence, in a letter to the signal of political leaders in Kosovo and to urge all Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegro to return to their countries, "he said.
"We are aware of the outcome of the end.
However, I think it is time and the situation is more serious, "he said.
Steiner is delayed, instead of a geography.
Portugal diplomat Jose Cutilio, Dutch policemen Jan Roberk and Evh Herker are among the candidates for Finnish diplomat Elizabeth Rehn and Italian diplomat Antonio Armelllo.
According to analysts, Annan could also be preferred to a unknown candidate by the public.
Steiner arrived in Kosovo 17 months ago.
Some criticised the approach of the approach for more authority, while some say Steiner is a clear, independent and extremist member.
Steiner worked on the establishment of the Kosovo Trade Agency, a multiethnic government, measures against smuggling, and the establishment of a special commission that will launch the privatisation process.
Steiner also envisioned the Penal Code and the Penal Code in Kosovo and launched a dialogue between Kosovo leaders and the Serbian government.
However, the return of refugees and tensions in the ethnically divided city of Mitrovica have yet to reach a solution.
According to Steiner, the policies in Belgrade and Pristina have been proud of the multiethnic climate in the region, according to Steiner, adding that policies in Belgrade and Pristina see the truth that Kosovo has begun to make a normal life as a multiethnic environment.
Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova has a different assessment of the issue.
Rugova says that recognition of Kosovo &aposs independence would have a positive impact on economic developments, which would affect inter-ethnic relations and therefore progress in Kosovo.
"We are waiting for our assistance in the future," Rugova told Steiner, at the sidelines of the Presidency State Hizmet Madar.
Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi speaks to Steiner.
Prime Minister Rexhepi told reporters that in co-operation with Steiner, he has been working very complicated, despite the differences of the village.
"Studies began a day of exported imports and all people have ended in a day when it was created and free," Brayshaw said, referring to Steiner, who was named on July 4th at the Day of Public.
Enver Hoxhaj, a professor of Political Science at the University of Pristina, believes Steiner was the first major success in the Kosovo Framework Constitution, which was based on the Kosovo Framework Constitution.
"The approach of Steiner showed at the time has dropped tensions between international and local environments," Hoxhaj said.
Hoxhaj added that Kosovo leaders and Serbian and other minority leaders have not been working closely with Steiner to achieve their goals, and that is why UNMIK chief is limited in many areas.
"Following the pressure in 1999, Kosovo has begun to move forward on the road to free, prosperity and democratic society," Steiner said in a latest report to the Security Council on July 1st.
The participation has not been spread to the country, he said, but the foundations that will allow them to take place.

In the past four months, the risk of investments has dropped by improvement of economic and political conditions in Serbia, including the electoral electoral President Boris Tadic.
"Today, we are among the highest risk in seven points.
This is the highest risk.
Bulgaria and Romania, for example, are five points, and Croatia four.

Later Elections in Croatia on Sunday
Lawmakers in Croatia will replace two major parties in the elections Sunday.
Without the outcome, the next government will be a coalition and the first task will be to negotiate for the EU.
By Ivana Erceg for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 20 / 11 / 03
Two most affected political parties in Croatia, Prime Minister Ivica Racan 'Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Croatian Democratic League (HDZ), sparked the parliamentary elections on Sunday (November 23rd).
Both parties emphasise that the country will be able to join the EU.
In the public opinion polls, HDZ is a leading force of the current centre-left coalition, the SDP.
The HDZ, which won between 20 per cent and 28 per cent in the last surveys, has come from the SDP to 9 per cent.
Analysts say the centre-right coalition partner, the main coalition partner in the upcoming elections, which has been pushing for a higher participation and carrying cards.
Meanwhile, another coalition member of the Croatian Peoples' Party (HNS) has made it clear that the SDP will leave a post-election coalition.
However, the HNS decided to enter the elections with some small political parties, as it wants to experience the political force as independent.
This could cause division of votes.
If there is no party victory, the next government will be a coalition and the main task will be to negotiate for the EU.
Croatia, whose application for EU membership in February, hopes to begin negotiations with the bloc and join the bloc in 2007 with Bulgaria and Romania.
However, the opportunity to achieve this goal was dangerous because Croatia has not arrested retired General Ante Gotovina, who was wanted by the UN war crimes tribunal for allegedly involving at least 150 ethnic Serbs during the 1991-1995 war.
Croatian EU membership depends on full co-operation with The Hague tribunal.
With the EU, Croatia has made it clear that it expects Croatia to extradite Gotovina to The Hague.
HDZ President Ivo Sanader said his party is more different than the party who managed the war. "Even if General Gotovina", General Gotovina will be able to co-operate fully with the UN tribunal ".
Sanader also called on Serbs to return, in line with another important demand from the EU.
Others see the HDZ moves as a electoral framework.
Some warn that the party would continue to create a party type of nationalist voters by reminding the past scale.

In addition, Macedonian authorities have been targeted by criticism of local businesses, who have been pushing the law on smoking in public areas since January 1st.
"For now, the intellectual cases are under law for high money penalties, but there is a decline in prison," the owner of the popular cafe-bar Play in Skopje told Southeast European Times.
The decline in the winners could lead to a decline in the number of employees, they warn.
About 17,000 people living in Macedonia are directly direct or intellectual / cafe.
Ognen Cigovski, head of the Macedonian Cafe Bar and Resting Studies, said on Friday that several businesses will be finished for a 24-hour protest.
Furthermore, the law wants to be changed in order to allow smoking and internal sites, and is trying to meet officials to find a solution.
However, the government does not change its position.
"Macedonia is not the first country to decide on full implementation of the smoking law in public areas, and the last country will not be in," Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Pesevski said.
The citizens are viewed by the law.
The government, restaurant, cafe, bar and clubs, made 1350 textbooks, and only two violations in Kumanovo and Gostivar.
Those who violate the law were sentenced in the case of money, and the businesses were also violated.
The money has changed between 150-300, businesses and 2500-4500 euros for individuals.
The law is repeatedly closed to the businesses to 30 years.
Prosecutors made 208 textiles in public enterprises and local government agencies, and a single violation has not been found.
However, "smoking is law on smoking," they violated 19 violations because they did not take couple ".
"The law should be good and changed," Skopje resident resident Zoran Stefanovski told SETimes. "I am not a restaurant with a few days ago, and I am really happy because I was not a restaurant.
"People should not be allowed to be smoked in the places where people are going to be able to go."
Those smoking believe the law is more attention.
Olivera Pankova believes "European laws" must warn the local assembly and that the government must only allow smokers to be smoked.
"If the smokers will be discovered, smokers can decide whether to enter such barricades," Pankova said.
Opposition lawmakers Vlado Buckovski and Gorghe Orovlievec began signing a procedure in parliament to change the law.
"We have no objections to this law, but we think there are no restrictions," Buckovski said, referring to a model that allows cafes on 100 square metres to smoking and to allow businesses to apply smoking in their businesses. "
New northern Kosovo strategy targets criticism
A strategic document that adds a new approach to northern Kosovo has been criticised by Serbian representatives.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 18 / 01 / 10
"The option is strong, fair and multiethnic legal institutions for all communities," EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon said. [Getty Images]
According to local media reports, the Kosovo government and the International Civil Administration (ICO) have been targeted by Serbian representatives, which revealed a new approach and strategy for the northern part of Kosovo.
The strategy envisions the establishment of a North Mitrovica municipality by mid-year.
The plan also envisions the Kosovo government to hold local elections in three northern municipalities -- Zvecan, Leposavic and Zubin Potok.
According to Pristina, the new approach will assist the marathon of Serbian structures operating in this part of Kosovo and envisions the increase of EULEX presence.
"The option is strong, fair and multiethnic legal institutions for all communities.
This judge will be a safety of justice and the word will be important for parallel structures, "he said.
De Kermabon said that EULEX would replace the Kosovo Serb and Albanian judges and prosecutors to the Mitrovica District Court and to ensure that justice would be removed to the local, multiethnic and a single judiciary.
"There is no other place in Europe and there is no two judiciary systems that operate in the same place.
The two judicial authority will cause justice to be implemented, and will tackle decisions against the rights of people.
Only a single judiciary in Kosovo could be a single judiciary, "he said.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci expressed support for the new strategy.
"The establishment of the rule of law on the territory of Kosovo is also meaning the implementation of structures or prevent obstacles from individuals who do not recognise the institutions and laws of Kosovo," Thaci said.
The new plan aims to improve the economic situation in the region, he added.
"Strategy is four main areas: strengthening the rule of law in the entire territory of Kosovo, the establishment of new municipalities in decentralisation and new municipalities in northern Mitrovica, the issue of local governments in the three northern municipalities and improving the economic situation in Kosovo."
According to Serbian National Council of North Kosovo President Milan Ivanovic, however, Serbs want to remain in the constitution and the legal system.
Therefore, the new plan will cause stability in the north.
"This strategy, which is aimed at exporting UNMIK that must work within 1244, is to be exported from Kosovo and aiming to bring UNMIK from countries that have created independent Kosovo, instead of independent Kosovo, would not be able to resolve the final success of the elections in Mitrovica," Ivanovic said.
Serbian President Boris Tadic told Glas Srbije that the Kosovo issue has not been closed for Serbia.
Belgrade wants to negotiate with Kosovo Albanians to find a "reconciliation" in Kosovo.
Tadic stressed that Serbia "will never recognise the independence of Kosovo", but emphasised that "Kosovo Albanians have no intention to hand their lives".
Kosovo has faced challenges in the north ", Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu told the World Council on January 12th in San Francisco.
"There is a lot of people who have been justice in these structures.
They have the past of crimes committed in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.
"It will be difficult to deserve stability in this part of Kosovo, which has turned into a region where people have been transferred to justice," he said.

With the Danube continued to withdraw, Romania is the 1st nuclear power plant in Cernioda.
The excavation system is liberalising the work of the actress crowd. The 70.5 melttery actor is expected to be closed to four to six weeks.
"Reactor will be closed to the level of the Danube to 22.5 square meters, and the study will depend on whether the river will reach enough to ensure the normal function of the plant," Romanian Economy and Trade Minister Dan Ioan Popescu said on Sunday (August 24th).

Despite the numerous unity and advertising contract in recent months, the delegation, which will serve as Kosovo 'approach status talks, has been serious internal bribery due to its failure to fight each member.
October, President Ibrahim Rugova, Prime Minister Bajram Kosumi, Parliament Speaker Nejat Daci, Democratic Party of Kosovo leader Hashim Thaci and ORA leader Veton Syroi.
Daci, who was held before NATO intervened in Kosovo in 1999, was all attended by Daci.
According to local media reports, problems came after a meeting with US Secretary of State Nicholas Burns.
Blerim Sala, co-ordinator of the co-ordinator that Rugova was appointed, received Daci.
Daci, who was a lot, later, did not consider Sala 'proposal to create working groups.
Then Thaci, he accused Sala of "not the legitimate legitimacy for the policy postponement".
Sala, the editor-in-chief of the Zeri daily, responded to them with his own broadcaster, and wrote Daci and Thaci 'negotiation team.
He also used similar statements in the KTV TV station, where ORA party leader Veton Syroi is owner of another member of the ORA.
Some broadcast Syroi and Sala 'intelligence against Daci and Thaci.
However, there has been no longer been a long time, with Syroi and Thaci in a local barricades.
"Currently, this month has a very great importance," said Ilber Hysa, a professor of Syroi 'aid.
Rugova has since confirmed that the "working group will be institutional" and tried to climate the climate.
This means that a strong role will be approved by the parliamentary president.
However, it is now facing a new conflict on whether the negotiating strategy should be based on some specialised recommendations, or that the political institutions should be prepared by political institutions.
Kosovo negotiators have to deal with threats from a extremist formation called "Kosovo Independent Army", as they did not comply with the withdrawal.
A e-poster sent by the group, the negotiating team, headed by Rugova, was asked to declare Kosovo 'independence as a unilateral declaration of Kosovo and that Belgrade would not be able to sovereignty over Preeva Vada, a region in southern Serbia.
A person who was "Commander Luxeman", is also a threat that lawmakers are awaiting themselves in a very power period if they are not in accordance with voters.

In recent years, financing companies in Serbia have increased their jobs.
The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has to leave them with new regulations.
The finance sector has become a liquidity for similar individuals and companies.
Consumption and architects, such as financial pollution in Serbia, are the most frequent in commercial and buildings, television and households, consumer goods and alcohol equipment.
Serbs, who have been a major job against such goods during the years of breaking and economic stagnation, have been sentenced to ease facilities in the short period, while in the long term, they are unlikely to be registered.
According to official data, the director of the Serbian financing market was 220m euros in the first ten months of 2004.
This figure is four times the amount of the amount, which was first in the first six months of 2003, when the financial type took the country.
According to the new regulations, financing will have to invest NBS reserves funds, while the institutional pollution cost must be made more difficult.
All participants in the market will be able to sell licenses and financing companies will be financed by the Central Bank and will have to have a serious plan for future commercial activities and sufficient personnel.
In addition to many consumers, financing will not be allowed to be allowed for the quality of the average salary in Serbia -- a close amount of 2,000 euros -- and will not be allowed to be allowed for general consumption, including automographic and alcohol products.
The transport sector, which will feel the first feasibility of this.
The average cars or commercial vehicles are in Serbia, while the economy will also require new vehicles, with the opening of the EU.
NBS officials, however, insist the goal of the new rules is not forced to make the citizens, but it is imposed to some financial funding.
In addition, authorities said they have signed all requirements for consumers to organise the arrangements, always defending consumers' programmes.
"We are repeatedly willing to make the conditions for the consumption to present all expenditures in the first five to six years," NBS Director Dejan Simic said.
Finnish pollution companies claim that this would increase services.
The only reason is that it can present the clients to present better circumstances because they do not need to invest in the Central Bank.

The Greek Parliament on Wednesday (November 2nd) approved the accession agreement with Bulgaria and Romania, which envisions the two countries' entry into the EU in January 2007.
The presidents of Bulgaria and Romania, Georgi Parvanov and Traian Basescu, also attended the special session of parliament, as well as Greeks' Karolos Papoulias.
Members of the three-seat assembly supported the two countries' agreements as a smaller majority.
Only 30 years ago, the Communist Party voted against the same reasons that Greece opposes membership.
Therefore, Greece, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and Cyprus were the fifth EU member states to ratify the agreement in Luxembourg on April 25th.
Bulgaria and Romania must be approved by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the end of this year, to be approved by all EU countries to enter the Union until December 31st 2006.
The European Commission (EC) warned Bulgaria and Romania last month to speed up the implementation of the necessary reforms needed to be postponed by a year.
The EC will decide on whether the two countries are ready to meet the requirements for EU membership next year or May.
Parvanov, who thanked Greece for ratification of the agreement, expressed confidence that Bulgaria will meet its commitments to the EU, despite a number of challenges.
Basescu made similar remarks.
"Bulgaria and Romania [EU] membership in the Balkans] will be upgraded," Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis told lawmakers. "This will open new sanctions to strengthen regional co-operation."
Voicing hope for the other Balkan countries to move towards EU membership, Karamanlis said it would "guarantee regional peace, stability and democracy".

During a conference in Brussels on November 9th, the two countries -- Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia -- rejected an agreement on the free trade zone in Southeast Europe.
The countries, which have been made until December 19th to resolve the remaining dispute, will risk the risk of losing a market, including 40 million people.
The current Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) is scheduled to replace the 31-bilateral agreement, which will enable Albania, BiH, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro and Kosovo.
The agreement is considered very important for EU enlargement in the region.
"Financial co-operation is not based on the right to co-operate, but a precondition of success," Stability Pact chief Erhard Busek said last week. "The growing market is not the rise, but development.
If you want to compete outside the entire region, we need to open European markets through regional co-operation. "
BiH and Serbia oppose a variety of opening an agreement with the current government.
Sarajevo, Croatia and Serbia are seeking an article allowing products to be interim.
In addition, bilateral contracts signed with the two countries are hoping to legalise and unilaterally.
Croatia and Serbia have also found BiH to protect itself after they agreed to ensure a mutual agreement on ensuring customs protection of sexual and subsidies.
Authorities decided to bring restrictions from farmers.
The main objective of Serbia is on the disappointment of Croatia and the tobacco industrial industry.
Both countries have closed markets with a bridge approach.
The Croatian own producer, Rovinj, is protecting the tobacco factory with 38% customs duties.
Serbia, meanwhile, is being implemented by a small tax (15%), but is protected with high consumption taxes (Philip Morris and British American Tobacco, respectively, with the factory in Nis and Vranje.
Foreign Economic Relations Minister Miln Paridovic said the ministry will soon go to Zagreb to find a solution.
Among the markets' preservation of customs barricades, CEFTA has been critical to the principles that creates free trade, and free trade advocates say they will harm the country in the long term.
The economies of BiH and Serbia have no competition in the regional market, which will be completely active in 2010.
This will bring them open to global competitiveness pressure.

So far, the number of Croatian soldiers have been increased.
Currently, there are 150 soldiers, including the latest union of 69 soldiers sent in June.

The city, the centre of Taliban activities, is very dangerous.
Croatian authorities have decided to launch an investigation to determine whether the Croatian union has been changed and changed under the conditions.

So far, all incidents have been discovered with smoothly injuries.
In the ISAF, more than 18,000 soldiers have been involved in their contributions to 37 countries.

Gul: Turkey will not lead to EU pressure on trade with Cyprus
Turkish officials said on Tuesday that the question would not help resolve the issue of the question for the opening of Turkish ports and airports to Cyprus traffic.
(AFP, AP, International Herald Tribune, VOA, Zaman, Turkish Daily News - 21 / 11 / 06)
"The issues such as Cyprus are not resolved, or not solved," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said in Ankara. [Getty Images]
Turkey said on Tuesday (November 21st) that the EU is not planning to take steps to open its ports and airports to Cyprus, as demands a day ago.
"The issues such as Cyprus cannot be resolved, or not solved," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul told reporters after a meeting with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Turkey 'chief EU negotiator Ali Babacan in Ankara.
Gul statement came a day after Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, warns that Turkey could stop its accession talks with the Union if it does not meet its trade commitments on Cyprus in the next two weeks.
"If we are unacceptable conditions are not acceptable, it cannot be possible to ensure progress," the AFP quoted Erdogan as saying on Tuesday.
Ankara signed an expansion protocol that would enable new members of the bloc, including Cyprus, before its accession talks with Brussels began in October 2005, a customs union agreement with the EU signed in 1963.
Only a few days after the Greek Cypriots rejected the UN plan for reunification with Turkish Cypriots in the north in May 2004, when the Greek Cypriots refused to reunify themselves with Turkish Cypriots.
The agreement was not accepted by the majority of the Turkish Cypriots recognised by Ankara, but the island was unacceptable to the 25-nation bloc.
Turkey refuses to allow Greek Cypriot ships and airports to enter the ports and airports, despite its obligations under the customs protocol.
Instead, the country insists that the EU has fulfilled its promise to foster the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community.
Finland, which aims to end this stalemate, would allow Turkey to enter Greek Cypriot ships and airports, while the Famagusta port in northern Cyprus has proposed a consensus that would open its port to trade with the 25-nation bloc.
At the same time, the town of neighbouring Malota will return to former Greek Cypriot residents and be allowed to live there.
According to the Turkish Daily News, however, Finnish proposal does not allow the opening of the Erdjan airport in Turkey to international flights.
The British newspaper said that if the ruling Justice and Development Party accepts the agreement, there will be a great political risk in the general elections next year.
Gul, scheduled to arrive in Finland on Sunday, said Ankara does not reject the Fund plan and that his proposal is "the most discussed".
"The head of the Fund is working and we are supporting these efforts," Gul said on Tuesday. "We are still at large."

Bulgaria: Nabucco must be EU priority
Bulgaria said on Tuesday that the EU should encourage the project to speed up the countries participating in the Nabucco natural gas pipeline.
(BTA, Sega, Stand.bg, Oil & Gas Eurasia - 01 / 12 / 10; Reuters, BTA, Sofia News Agency, Dnevnik.bg, Mediapool, The Bank, Publics.bg, ANSA, Xinhua, Bulgarian Government - 30 / 11 / 10)
Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Italy signed energy agreements. [Reuters]
Bulgaria urged the EU on Tuesday (November 30th) to allow member states that participate in the project to ensure that the Nabucco natural gas pipeline project is really important for the Union, to allow the banks to leave their budget deficits.
Sofia has always seen Nabucco as a priority, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said at a conference on the energy sector in Southeast Europe.
"However, there are many things that the work and the project has a priority for the EU, I will say about the real consensus," Borisov said. "My proposal is a message to the European Investment Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Nabucco."
The 8-billion-euro pipeline is in the stalemate of the EU &ap91; South Stream Corridor] initiative and aims to reduce its commitment to the 27-nation bloc to Russian supplies.
The project will transport natural gas from the Caspian region and Central Asia to Europe, when it comes to a natural gas network in Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary via Austria.
The Nabucco consortium, comprised of six companies that will assume the Nabucco pipeline, development of the Nabucco pipeline, the Austrian oil and natural gas company OMV, Bulgaria and Romania 'state-owned Energy Holding, Hungarian MOL, Turkish BOHAT and Germany.
Nabucco Executive Director Rienhard Mitschek said that nearly 2 billion euros of the six shares should enable bank guarantees.
According to Borisov, this amount will enable Nabucco to the state security of the countries that have to provide state security.
"I will not stop the project, but we have to mean that this will take us into account," the Bulgarian prime minister said.
Bulgaria did not participate in bank guarantees that will be given the 2011 budget for Nabucco, which is prevented by 2.5% of GDP.
Therefore, the EU will stay on the 3% of GDP, set up for the countries in the bloc, if Sofia has removed its request for fiscal facilitation of member states that participate in the project.
In a separate move, Borisov &aposs centre-right European Parliament (GERB) members of the European Parliament (MERB) party (MEP) stressed on Tuesday that Nabucco must become a real priority of the EU.
"Nabucco should be considered a priority because it is an alternative to diversification of energy sources in Europe," the GERB (MEP) MEP said in Brussels.
"The project will guarantee a significant amount of gas supplies and will encourage EU citizens to take competitiveness in the European natural gas market and eliminate energy deficits in Bulgaria and the EU," he said.
Meanwhile, Bulgarian Energy Minister Trajko Trajkov called on Tuesday to develop a joint energy plan for Southeast Europe, "a resort of a region, but now becomes a centre for energy with the Caspian region".
According to the ministry, "great opportunities".
Nevertheless Tuesday, Trajkov and Romanian Economy Minister Ior Ariton signed a memorandum of understanding that would unite the two countries' energy markets.
According to the Bulgarian ministry, the two Balkan neighbours are expected to improve the safety of energy systems and improving energy efficiency in the region.
Trajkov has many areas that we will achieve more benefits if we co-operate, "said Trajkov.
He also announced that an agreement was signed on the establishment of a joint company to build the first natural gas connection between the two countries and the Greek IGI Poseidon.
The 170km pipeline, which will extend the city of Comotini in northern Greece, will have the capacity to transport natural gas to Bulgaria and other Balkan countries by 5 billion cubic metres annually. The 160m-euro project will be completed in 2013.
"This was the last step before the start of the pipeline," Trajkov said after the signing ceremony Tuesday.

European officials have demanded that Romania and Bulgaria have made real progress in reform the judicial systems, under which the European Commission (EC) examines the review of the 25-nation Schengen zone (MCV), as well as the European Commission (EC), which is under way to gain participation in the Schengen zone.
The latest and clear call came from French President Nicolas Sarkozy.
"I know the Commission is working with Romania and Bulgaria," Sarkozy said at a summit in Lisbon in November.
"I cannot wait the end of this process before the accession date," he said.
The stance of his country was shared by Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, he said.
"We will only participate in [Schengen] when problems are resolved," Sarkozy said.
He also urged the two countries to make safe borders before they join the region.
"If the two countries join the Schengen member, European borders will also mean that border problems should be resolved without a member.
If the problem is not resolved -- for example, Roma and Moldovans -- it would become the problem of all Schengen countries, "he said.
Sarkozy &ap91; remarks] in other environments in Europe.
The new ruling coalition, founded between the Liberals and Christian Democrats in the Netherlands, has also linked Romania and Bulgaria to progress in the judiciary.
"In the European context, the government will defend Romania and Bulgaria to join the two-year reports on corruption and judicial reform in the two countries.
If these reports do not meet the final criteria, the Netherlands will not support Romania and Bulgaria 'full participation in the Schengen and the removal of internal border control in the EU, Bulgaria and Romania will not be accepted, "the Dutch said in a statement.
A warning came from Martin Schultz, head of the Socialist group in the European Parliament, said France and Germany could oppose the two countries' participation because of concerns about immigrants and concerns that the EU would seek business in other areas.
"I am the possibility of membership in 2011, when the two major countries are opposed, it is unlikely to be offered to vote in 2011," said Schultz, the Bulgarian state radio.
Romanian Justice Minister Catalin Prediou, who faces a consensus in Europe, urged Bucharest to do more.
"We believe that Romania must support its prosecutors to continue its image of the Schengen accession chapter, free and conservative forms.
Membership is largely convinced that European partners have the capacity to manage any compensation in border control because of the Schengen procedures, "he said.
Meanwhile, the EC says the Schengen membership is evaluated, according to the defined criteria.
"MCV and accession talks are two parallel times," European Commission Commissioner for Affairs Cecilia Malmstrom said last week.
Romanian analysts feel sales.
"Bucharest has been very easy to establish the MCV in recent months, but the latest EC report on the judiciary shows that Romania is weak to reach this point because it has been criticised in the justice area," Cristian Ciuperca, judicial chief of the Romanian Libera newspaper, told SETimes.
"The two countries' targets of the MCV, and Sarkozy has come to a future, which is unlimited," he said.
"It is even more important than the government warns that the next EC report could be released next summer," the French leader said.

"We received the case because of the action 'impression of organised crime," said Jovan Ilievski, head of the Prosecutor' Office for Organisation. "We have not rejected the possibility of expanding members of the time [cabinet]."
The investigation is expected to last about a month.
Prosecutors will try to determine whether Crvenkovski has violated the 353 Madaster of the Penal Code, which envisions the opening of the public tender in the purchase of service, and to decide whether he is convicted.
If he was indicted and convicted, Crvenkovski could be sentenced to four years.
The case won a boycott, when Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor rejected allegations that he played a role in the case.
Ana Deneva, head of the SDSM central committee, claimed that Pahor had proposed a proposal to Crvenkovski.
Pahor responded, saying there is no way.
"We have never sent an advisory to former President Branko Crvenkovski and we expect a statement from the Macedonian Social Democratic Union," he said.
Crvenkovski issued a deepening letter, voiced regret that the Slovenian prime minister was "discovered without any reasons".
He described the incident as "a disappointed initiative".
The SDSM said he did not do something wrong to the former head of state.
"President Branko Crvenkovski is completely completely spending the money of tax taxes, personal and party interests.
The funds have been spent on communication with the people, public researchers and advising Macedonia on the strategy for promoting promotion in the EU and NATO, "he said.
It also announced that Crvenkovski would invest in the local Sitel TV channel, which published various allegations, including Slovenian experts since 1996.
Professor and analyst Dar Mircev told SETimes that the UK plan is less concerned about the legal aspects of the legal aspects, and more concerned about the consultation of Crvenkovski.
"Crvenkovski tried to win an inappropriate and incomplicated score of the current government.
The recommendations in the Umert plan have been used to improve the state and its international image, but it is not only used for his personal image, "he said.

PASOK discovered the ruling centre-right New Democracy (ND) party in the early elections Sunday (October 4th).
Now, two of the PASOK members of George Papandreou, led by George Papandreou, must be forced to Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
"Papandreou has a lot of global views and wants a greater role for Greece in the EU," political analyst George Kirstos told Monday.
According to Kirstos, PASOK will likely remain on the agenda of the former government on the name dispute with Macedonia.
Athens is under pressure on its neighbour to exercise a geography, such as "northern" in international relations.
According to Paschos Mandravelis, however, columnist of the daily Kathimerini, the Macedonian government is unlikely to accept this request.
Some experts believe that the secret name issue will always be a problem on the European integration of the region.
Kirtsos said the country will not be an important change in its policy towards Turkey, which is a candidate for EU membership.
Ankara will continue to meet the requirements for membership.
Papandreou criticised the former Greek government of Greece, criticising former Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis of "an aggress" to stop Greece ’ s EU bid after it refused to meet certain criteria.

Instead, Turkey is not expected to become a member in the near future, and there is nothing that Greece will lose with a compromise consensus.
In addition to the PASOK victory, Kirstos and other analysts are surprised that the party won a major difference.
"The Greek voters ordered the message that they want an effective government," he said.

Kirstos, party and founder, former ND lawmakers and a female EP MP Giorgos Karacaferis, pointed out that he is more popular, architecture and sympathy political vehicles.

This donation is very important to enable the Kosovo judiciary to fulfil European standards. "
Mustafa-Remi, a lawyer from the Kosovo Democracy Party and the head of parliament 'Security and Interior Commission, declared a press conference after the sentence was announced.
"Today, the justice system has been made within the justice system.
This is an external intervention that we are waiting.
However, Latif Gashi, who has been on the way to withdraw the sentence today, nor Nazdi Mehmeti, do not feel guilty, "he said.

Croatian government sparked budget bill
The large budget cuts, wage cuts and massive jobs are in a difficult days of Croatian people.
By Drazen Remikovic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb -- 06 / 03 / 12
With food prices and the VAT rate reached the highest level of all time, Croats are waiting difficult days. [Reuters]
The first effects of the austerity measures in Croatia died on March 1st, when the government gained the VAT rate by 2% to 25%.
Only Iceland and Hungarian VAT rates are higher in Europe.
The food prices increased and oil and natural gas supplies rose by 3% on Tuesday (March 6th).
Finance Minister Slavko Solic said the VAT increase could be excellent, but it is necessary.
"It is important that the citizens of the VAT increase will not be proud in the government and the administration of the government, and that it will be used to create employment," he told reporters in Zagreb earlier this month.
The VAT increase was proposed by the government for the 2012 state budget and is only one of the austerity measures adopted by the government in February, which was considered "logical and realistic", but discrimination in the country.
The Croatian state budget in 2012 will be set by 14.6 billion euros, while spending in the public sector will spend 15.5 billion euros, even with salaries cuts and labour.
Fitch Operations confirmed this week as the lowest investment rating of Croatia, the BBB-, and the country has made a negative outlook due to the budget deficit.
Darko Solic, 28, from Zagreb, said the government is expected to save austerity decision on salaries and workers.
"People cannot expect politicians to suffer their own salaries.
Only we need to accept any austerity measure to citizens and employees, "he said.
Although the government announced more than 660m euros, it was reduced to 440m euros.
Economic analysts have not been satisfied with the decision, saying the government should stop austerity.
Zagreb Economy Institute Director Sandra Shejek said the government 'announcement that the public companies will be great investment.
"You cannot forget any asylum.
The government estimated a 0.8% GDP growth for this year, but analysts show that Croatia will have a negative GDP growth between 0.5% and 1.5%.
Even if the bill is implemented, Croatia will continue to have a high budget deficit, "he said.
Many ministries received less money by last year.
The Agriculture Ministry has allocated about 60m euros in the budget, while the same amount has been dropped from the state railway enterprises.
The government announced it has announced the job in the railway enterprises, and the state daily Vjesnik, which was supported by the government, was worked by 180 employees.
At the end of February, Croatian Affairs Union President Mladen Novosel dismissed government representatives, who announced the jobs in the public sector, reducing social aid and end about 260m euros in austerity for the work of about 5,000 free workers.
"I questioned that if the government representatives, 5,000 people in the public sector are more than 5,000.
It was a step forward.
For the past few years in Croatia, more than 100,000 people lost their jobs in the sector, "he said.
The Croatian Authorities' Association said the government is surprised to reduce public spending 440m euros and reminded the first plan that envisions more than 700m euros.
"We are not satisfied with the process of recognising the new VAT rate.
The deadline for the government, which was announced for the GDP growth, has been recognised by March 1st, is very stable and send a negative message to potential investors in Croatia, "he said.
Employment Party Speaker Zlatko Tusak said the reactions made by the new budget are unfair.
"The budget proposal has caused many negative reactions, but the austerity will see improvements in a few months if they are held in the right areas.
However, employment rights in Croatia is now the European average, "he said.

UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen welcomed the agreement on establishing a coalition government between the Democratic Union of Kosovo (LDK) and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AEC).
"Following the elections, I called on political parties to accelerate the voters' right and urged them to do so," Jessen-Petersen said on Wednesday (November 17th) after the LDK spokesperson Lulzim Zenana announced the agreement.
UNMIK chief voiced confidence that "the new responsibility for interim institutions are closely working with representatives of minority communities, and will prove their commitment to our common goal of creating a stable, stable society".
The agreement came three weeks after Kosovo &aposs second parliamentary elections since the UN administration in 1999.
According to Zenje, several other small parties will participate in the coalition.
On October 23rd, the October 23rd elections won by Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova, with 45 per cent of the LDK party, but failed to win a slow majority.
The AEC finished third with 8 per cent of the vote.
According to the AP, some international officials have suggested that the second largest Kosovo Albanian Party -- Hashim Thaci, who won 29 per cent of the votes -- will be transferred to a broad coalition that would be able to get the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).
Instead, the coalition will meet opposition parties.
"PDK leader Hashim Thaci has nominated the prime minister and will remain in the opposition if this proposal is not acceptable," PDK board member Cavit Haliti told a Kosovo newspaper earlier this month.
AEC members also promised a similar message, saying the prime minister would not participate in the government coalition if they are not given the post.
Despite the announcement Wednesday, the majority expects Haradinaj to head the cabinet, and Rugova will continue to continue the president.
The new coalition government is expected to be in office during talks on the province 'final status in mid-2005, if Kosovo has made significant progress in meeting the criteria set by the UN, the rule of law, minority rights and inter-Belgrade dialogue.
Haradinaj, a former KLA commander in the status talks, will represent the province as prime minister.
Haradinaj, however, was questioned by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague last week on his role in the 1998-1999 conflict in the province.
UN chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte said the KLA members of the KLA, now displaced by the end of the year, would issue new claims.
Analysts say a charges against Haradinaj could cause the government crisis.
Albania research renewable energy sources
While the circumstances dropped, Albanian people are waiting energy restrictions and electricity cuts.
The government is seeing new options that will lead to the country 'cheaper energy crisis.

Last January, broadcasters have been spread from the electricity energy officers in a car in Tirana.
Albania has been forced to meet its energy demand since the 1990s, and it is becoming a symbol of electricity cuts. [Getty Images]
Albanian electricity needs 95% of the hydropower plants (HES), but this year has affected the water levels of barricades and plants do not meet increasingly energy demands.
The restrictions, such as the previous circumstances, electricity cuts and various interim measures are expected.
The country has not been able to meet its own needs, but it has produced energy until it is exported to neighbouring countries.
However, the demand since the beginning of the 1990s has reached 6,800 GWh, while electricity production has dropped up to 4,000 GWh, which is responsible for the decrease and the situation in HES.
In Tirana and other cities, electricity cuts are implemented by eight hours a day, while cuts in some rural areas are under way to 15 hours.
The situation is alone.
The renewable energy projects have won a priority.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha said on November 7th that the government contributed to diversification of energy resources and would support any project.
Representatives of Camozozy Holding and Westinerouse companies met with Berisha in late October to discuss the possibilities for investment in nuclear energy production.
Polls said they are interested in establishing a nuclear power plant in Durres.
"We aim to turn Albania into the energy production and export centre of the region," Berisha said.
Opposition politicians, however, are not optimistic.
Erion Brace, vice-president of the Socialists' parliamentary group, said the stage should be taken into account.
"The nuclear material must be transformed and destroyed," he said.
The new energy production has caused the creation of harmful radioactive disappointments that threaten the public, "Brace said, calling for the idea to submit public opinion.
He announced that his administration could hold a referendum on nuclear energy in the future.
At the same time, the government also investigates renewable energy resources.
In late October, the two main European companies submitted major projects to the government.
One of the companies, Italy, has proposed to build a major wind power plant near Krievic, 50km from Tirana. The facility must invest 200m euros for the facility, which will have a capacity of 150 square.
The second company, Naanovo, has offered a solar energy project to build a solar energy power plant near Durres, Tirana.
In the next few months, government officials will seek various proposals and will go on the most likely projects to end the energy crisis.

The Greek government is calling for dialogue on the ways of improving the education system, which currently ranks among the education agencies in Eurozone.
The EU report this year pointed out that Greece has stopped from other countries, in a programme to turn Europe into a information economy by 2010, the Lisbon Strategy, which is a programme aimed at transforming Europe by 2010.
Authorities say Greece has not yet formed a system that will be equipped to respond to the challenges and needs of young people.
Furthermore, the current system is insufficient to provide an overall general education.
The education ministry, which reviews education systems and reforms in other countries to find a solution, has chosen the Finnish system, which has achieved great success in implementing the model.
According to officials, the Fund system enables a general information fund and a certain professional skills needed to compete in the market.
Experts say a series of interventions will need to be made in order to overcome the Greek education system.
The currency should be transformed with new textbooks and consequences.
The latest technologies should be presented.
Foreign language education should be taken.
Furthermore, the results of the education system and need a safe method to get the rest.
The primary school, primary school or schools must be repeatedly evaluated.
One of the most important issues is the difficult education that must be taken to 9 years to meet international criteria.
This city is not a problem.
However, in rural parts of Greece, most of them do not stay more than six years in the school to help the children family.
According to the ministry, Greece must implement an effective system for education administration and control.
In addition, the government plans to implement amendments to catch the transition process with less damage.

The overall outcome of Serbia has improved with a decision by credit rating agency Standard and Poor to to to give the long-term Serbian state bonds and the B rating to short-term loans.
At the same time, Serbia has received an international credit rating for years.
However, business representatives warn that the risk of investment in Serbia is still high due to political instability and a large external debt of about 9 billion.
Earlier this month, representatives of the Bechtel firm visited Belgrade to discuss the Serbian Foreign Economic Relations Minister Milan Parivodic and the Hungarian highway project.
Bechtel, one of the largest construction companies in the world, is building ways in Croatia and Romania.

The highest risk of children is the Roma children, anne-babass children, private needs, children and poor or or pharmaceutical families.
The victims of human trafficking are more than China, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Pakhstan, Banglay and Serbia-Montenegro.
These are forcing business commitments in the EU countries and forced the majority.

Valier says the sentences for so far have been insufficient.
Last year, however, smuggling was first separate crime in the framework of Serbian laws, and police have made significant results.
However, he says, Serbia-Montenegro has to do more in order to end this type of crimes.

The entity government in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) began a campaign Tuesday (March 22nd), calling on the public to help fugitive indictees wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). For the first time since the 1992-1995 conflict ended, Republika Srpska (RS) authorities have demanded such a request.
A video movie features the restaurants of the fugitive indictees in the "Ya Once" campaign.
Of them, both of the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military commander Ratko Mladic, who have been on the ICTY since 1995.
He reminded that "them will go to The Hague, or if the indictees continue to avoid fugitives, BiH 'progress towards the EU and NATO will be changed.
Spot will be shown in the most vulnerable television stations in RS.
In addition, a telephone figure will also exhibit the list of ICTY indictees and information that those who want to provide information.
The failure of RS authorities to arrest and hand over indictees to The Hague has led to the invitation of the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme, considered the first step towards NATO membership.
The application for the PfP membership in BiH is likely to be discussed at the NATO foreign ministers' meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania, on 20 April.
According to a EP report, the rejection of the third time could mean that BiH hopes for accession to the programme.

"There is no doubt that our co-operation with the tribunal in The Hague or lack of co-operation with the tribunal in the next largest obstacle," Marovic told the Israeli daily Haumz, during a visit to Israel last week.
"I remind that the two former president, one of Serbia, one of the former Yugoslav president (Slobodan Milosevic), the two former Yugoslav generals, and several ministers and prime minister are now hiding in The Hague," he said. "In the last two months, eight people have surrendered to their own right, including the general.
There is a positive trend in co-operation between Serbia-Montenegro and The Hague tribunal, and we will continue to do everything to do so. "
Marovic reiterated that the government has not been able to know that Ratko Mladic, one of the three top indictees of the UN tribunal, has nothing to be hiding.
Chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte insists that Mladic is not only hiding in Serbia, but is also helping a Serbian military network, "Del Ponte said." The Serbian government has decided to arrest Mladic within a few hours, "he said.
In a same development, Deputy Defence Minister Pavle Jankovic said on Wednesday that co-operation with The Hague is the only obstacle to Serbia-Montenegro 'participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace programme.

This figure comes to 2.5 per cent of the country &aposs population, but the actual number of official estimates is around 2.5 million.
Roman historical experts agree that the Roma come from Europe or more before the 10th century, but Romania is very difficult to determine whether they are fully in its territory.
The former documentary that the Roma are in Romania from 1374 to 134.
The document features 40-Roma legend, which Dan has given the Vodita monastery.
The Roma have been on the status of the centuries. In 1424, the Transylvanian Roma were managed by a Vojvodina (provisions) in the Constitution, but in 1588, the province was removed by parliament.
Austrian Employment II Joseph was banned in Transylvania in 175.
Four years later, the Roma began accepting schools and churches in the province.
Among the two other Romanian province Moldova and Waltra, which has been under the Ottoman sovereignty, and the situation was aware of the situation.
The removal of the robbery in the two province could take place in 1855 and 1856 in 1856.
The death of the decades was implemented by Nazi Ion Antonescu, which was implemented during the World War II.
According to data from the Romanian War Crimes Committee, about 38,000 Romanian Roma lives during the Nazi massacre.
The communist dictator, which was formed, has been transferred to the Roma, in accordance with the goal of creating a homojen society in the country.
The Communist regime has tried to tackle the problem, while the communist regime was simply sincerely simply over the past year.
However, with the fall of communism and the start of the transition process, tensions in the society began.
The Romanian media, which began new growth, was also frozen. In 1991, it was killed by a Roma village in Bolintin Deal, near Bucharest.
This murder has been dealing with the Roma Roma in the village, and the Roma were given the homes.
Three years after the incident, three Roma were killed in September 23rd 1993 by villages in the village of Hadarseni, near the Mures.
One of the death was later discovered the Roma.
This murder also brought 14 homes from the Roma community, while 175 Roma villages who live in Hadarseni for 70 years have been filed.

According to a report by the European Roman Rights Centre, at least eight Roma people were killed in the violence between 1993 and 1993, and many were injured.
In addition, many Roma were discovered by police.
Such incidents, like individual violence, have been sentenced, and even a dozen investigation has not been investigated.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor, a leader of the Radical opposition party, has made an extraordinary statements.
According to a OSCE report, Tudor said in August 1998 that "Roma criminals are isolated in special churches, enabling Romania to return to a Chingdom camp".
Meanwhile, the government has realised the fact that a strategy for the Roma minority should be implemented.
In February 1997, the National Roman Bureau was formed as part of the National Ministry of Affairs.
In October 2004, it was transformed into the National Roma High Representative, led by a head of the state minister.
In 2001, the government adopted a national strategy for improving the quality of the Roma community.
In the framework of this strategy, social security, health, justice, education, communication and civilian participation are defined priorities in ten basic areas, including social security.
A PHARE project worth 7.6m euros, which aims to promote the strategy, was completed in April 2006.
Meanwhile, the Romanian Police Prosecutor launched a programme to improve relations between the Roma community and police and increase the capacity to respond to possible tensions between Roma and other communities.
The programme was developed with the help of the Justice Relations Project and the Louisville University of Justice.
In July 2003, the leader of eight Central and Eastern European countries met in Budapest, where the World Bank and the Open Society Institute launched an initiative "Roman Company", a project of the World Bank and the Open Society.
The main goal of this initiative is the end of poverty in the Roma community and discrimination against this society.
Romania headed the programme for a year in July 2005 and July 2006.
In July 2006, the World Bank decided to provide 58.5m euros to Romania for a social accession project.
As part of the loan, the most restricted groups (Roma minority, high risk and / software) aims to help children from abroad, obstacles and humanitarian violence victims.
The project was developed as the principles of the new country 'Partnership Strategy, to fulfil its obligations within the framework of the European Commission and the European Commission.
Romania will join the EU after three months.
For the reform and the benefits of EU membership, social sector issues are complete, as it can achieve the most weaknesses of the society.
The poverty rate of 74 is a serious risk of the country &aposs average of four points and 13 per cent of the average employment rate, and a quarter of the Roma census in 2002, according to the 2002 census census.
The Roma, the Roma, laws and officials, who do not want to give up their traditions in the early years, are facing frequent with the law and officials.
London Montch says Romania and Bulgaria must use a part of regional development funds to improve the living standards of Roma.
If there is no decisive effort on this issue, the developments will not be able to get short term.
And this is why Romania can pay, nor Bulgaria.
Giannis Valinakis: The Balkans must Still Together
In this exclusive exclusive interview with Southeast European Times correspondent Dimitris Agrafiotis, Greek Foreign Minister Giannis Valinakis says Kosovo, the Cyprus issue and the future of the Balkans.
By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens – 16 / 08 / 04
Greece is determined to support the creation of the basis for Southeast European countries to join the EU. [EU]
Although Southeast European countries must make progress on the path to joining the EU, Greece will stop these countries and support the necessary reforms, Greek Foreign Minister Giannis Valinis said, noting that co-operation between the countries and their differences have played a major role in this issue.
Southeast European Times: What is the chance for Southeast European countries to join the EU?
Giannis Valinakis: I can say that these countries are closer to the EU in the past.
The road to the EU is clear.
Everybody agrees that the road to Europe is the only direction.
The main issue is that a country will not participate in the Union "and not participate," he said.
Many things supporting this optimism.
Before everything, Slovenia, a Southeast European country, has been accepted to the EU in the short expansion period.
In addition, Bulgaria and Romania are also seen as a close target of 2007, but are likely to join the Union.
Croatia has made a positive response on the start of the talks, but Macedonia has not been able to join as soon as possible.
SE Times: What is the governments of Southeast European countries are ready to make progress on the implementation of structural changes needed to ensure EU criteria?
Greek Foreign Minister Giannis Valinakis says Turkish relations are "a good level". [File]
Valinakis: No one can see the important steps in strengthening both institutions and the economy today.
These steps are largely smaller in some areas.
We are very far aware of the countries in Southeast Europe to comply with the EU criteria, as we are not the majority of the steps.
The amendments should be made, and the role of these countries is under way.
SE Times: How do Greece contributed to the chances of joining other Southeast European countries?
Valinakis: We have always stopped with Southeast European countries and we continue to stop.
This is the basis of the reason: If we move in a European concession, everyone got the winner.
No one can live.
Therefore, Balkan countries must be formed with doubts and clashes.
We see that happens. On June 21st 2003, the Thessaloniki declaration was an important incident for Western Balkan countries.
For the first time, these countries' future was clearly seen as the EU.
Following and good neighbourly relations, solving peaceful ways, human rights, democratic ideas and values such as the rule of law and the rule of law, we can make Southeast Europe a region of co-operation, progress and prosperity for everyone.
SE Times: Do you think the situation in Kosovo is stable?
How do you think about security in the Western Balkans?
Valinakis: As a result of the violence in Kosovo, there is a rest of water in the past.
There are inequality in the region, and reputs are more attractive.
Nevertheless, we predict a future that citizens in the Balkans can live and fear that citizens in the Balkans can live, and that the past is the poor of the past.
There is no restoration that will provide it.
However, there are many things that have to be done for change.
First, co-operation between the countries should be improved and resolved the current problems.
We can work in this opinion.
EU accession should be a common model for all these countries.
SE Times: What is NATO membership in the process of integration with Southeast European countries?
Valinakis: The participation of Southeast European countries in NATO is a strategic goal, because stability is seen as another effective factor.
The NATO summit in Istanbul has made it clear that these countries have made progress on the path of both the Alliance and European institutions.
SE Times: Greece has made it clear that Turkey supports its EU accession.
But other European countries have shown different reactions.
How do you assess the chances of Turkey to join the Union?
Valinakis: As a country, we support Turkish efforts to meet the EU requirements.
In Turkey, positive steps have been taken on internal reforms and the willingness to take the necessary steps can see this balance.
Of course, it is not enough, but the process is necessary.
Some European countries' reactions understand the fact that it is much more to be done.
We all know the Copenhagen criteria.
Greece wants to see that road is completed.
As for the plans, it is not a date that everyone will be determined, but the first franch of a new relationship.
SE Times: There is a general channel in Turkish relations.
Is the two countries have solved problems in the searches?
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan (centre) is leaving the house in Athens. [AFP]
Valinakis: The Turkish relations are a good level.
In relations between the two countries, the new prime ministers are the right to have a better narrow. The personal co-operation between Costas Karamanlis and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is another factor that guarantees good relations.
Both sides are working in this opinion, when a European perspective will speed up the process of a better future for everyone.
As a member of the European family, Greece supports Turkey on the path to Europe, and Turkey is seeking to join the EU as a key candidate.
Nevertheless, we should not share the problems that have continued relations.
SE Times: You are also in the talks on resolving the Cyprus issue.
How do you see this issue?
What is your optimism?
Valinakis: The Cyprus issue is a major priority for Greek foreign policy, as an international problem.
A European solution to Cyprus will affect Turkish-Greek relations.
A solution seems to accept a solution as general.
At the same time, we hope that the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots can benefit from the benefits of the partnership with Europe, will be developed to a European solution.
Nevertheless, everyone depends on the Cyprus decision.

Most foreign tourists are diplomats and ambassadors who want to increase their information on the country.
Karacorce has not made a long success.
He and other prominent remarks have to avoid the Austrian Empire in 1813, when the Ottoman Empire launched a strong paramilitary.
The Azak Corce Church has been closed with 3500 square meters.

In Belgrade last week, four members of the Serbian Renewal Movement began a new case on the murder of the Ibar Otocol in October 1999.
Party head and leader Vuk Draskovic, Serbian opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, was forced with the incidents.
The hearing began a statement by former members of the Special Operations Corporation (JSO), currently disbanded, Nenad Ilic.
Ilic has been charged with suspicion of the murder.
Ilic, in the investigation of the killings committed in February 2001, condemned that he was involved in the murder.
Now, the defendant claimed that he and his family were sentenced to a few months in prison, and then he had promised him to provide new identity, help.
According to Ilic, the State Security Service believed that former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has been involved in a manner and that the case would delay the extradition of Milosevic to The Hague.
Ilic has now charged Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic of his close members to the assassination, Serbian Deputy President Cedomir Jovanovic.
This is not surprised by the victims' lawyer, Dragoljub Todorovic.
"It is not a special thing that the first judge did not take assessment," Todorovic said.
Even more time, the Constitutional Court did not comment.
"There is no special effect on this case, without other details," Jovanovic told SETimes.
In January 2003, the regional court sentenced former State Security Service head and a close partner of Milosevic and his friendship Rade Markovic to seven years in prison.
Two of the suspects, Nenad Bujosevic and Ilic, were sentenced to 15 years in prison, while the former head of the State Security Service in Belgrade was acquitted for all charges.
Markovic ’ s lawyer, Toma Pala, claims that Ilic has no importance and that it is valuable for the media, only for the media.
However, he also expressed concern about the final outcome of the case, due to the investigation is still waiting.
According to Pala, Markovic was not linked between Milosevic and the Ibar Otocol murders, but Mihajlo Usad.
Meanwhile, Usad was a former JSO chief who was charged with planning the murder of Djindjic.
In addition, despite the accusations, the Ibar Otocol has not been recognised as the fifth of the killings.
In a highway in Belgrade, the first assassination of Djindjic and a truck prime minister, the scenarios scenario in 1999 has an unprecedented gasoline among the scenario.
The JSO allegedly played a role in several murders of the political force in Serbia, and is hoping to reach new figures on the perpetrators.

Kosovo Serb Danijela Mitic is working as UNDP expert and lives in Cagllavica, near Pristina.
Mitic said his family feels itself in Kosovo and does not want to remove him.
In an exclusive interview with SETimes, Mitic assessed security and ethnic issues with Serbs living in Central Kosovo, and revealed their views on the future Serbs and Kosovo.
SETimes: Two years after Pristina accepted the Ahtisaari plan, which envisions broad autonomy and protective measures for the Serb minority, Kosovo Serbs are not convinced that they can live in a safe Kosovo, and are completely negative to the plan.
How do you think?
Danijela Mitic: The security situation in Kosovo has significantly increased.
Most Kosovo Serbs can be free in the country.
They come to Pristina, and the growing number of Serb institutions, especially as part of the decentralisation process, have been working in Kosovo institutions.
Tecritin has a lot of demonstrations when it comes to the problem.
For example, UNDP polls show that Kosovo Serbs are frustrated by the Belgrade media, and they want to talk more local news.
You want to know more than when you have experienced as a job.
Middle East Kosovo people are satisfied with freedom of movement and speech, and their lives are better.
SETimes: How do you live in Kosovo?
Mitic: I have a lot of waste to Pristina because of any ethnic problem and innocent.
SETimes: Do you trust the Kosovo police, which are more ethnic Albanians?
Mitic: This is not a matter of confidence, but the issue of doubts about the capacity of them.
I think they have the capacity to do all investigations.
SETimes: Do you trust that KFOR troops will protect Serbs in society?
Mitic: I think that KFOR is not something else from a security guarantee, and I think some beneficial projects such as small society support.
However, I am convinced that I do not want to see in the streets such as them.
We do not think they are not in mind.
I see it as progress.
SETimes: Do you think many Serbs in South and central Kosovo plan to transport from the country?
Mitic: I think the decisions are causing living conditions.
Zaman has changed and people are changing.
People seek better life opportunities.
As I say, there are more Serbs to stop.

The finance ministry and the prosecution have already started investigating former ministries and other senior officials, on suspicion of the mandate of secret contracts.
"The main economic goal of Bulgaria is to overcome the crisis.
But we continue to be a priority for the eurozone, and we will continue to work on this road, "he said." We are completely possible to apply for the eurozone membership before January 2011. "
According to Georgi Angelov, a economist at the Open Society Institute in Sofia, the ERM2 application will be "a great mistake".
While the health, pension and public administration have been delayed long, such a move would send investors "a very bad signal" on the willingness of the cabinet to address the issues, Angelov said.
Some fear that the EU will not provide up to the euro, as the problems facing the poorest member of the economic crisis facing the fall.
"The prices will increase, and the Bulgarian medium-sized climate will be more poverty," she told SETimes in Sofia.

US Secretary of State James Steinberg recently described relations between the United States and Serbia as "excellent".
Serbian President Boris Tadic said Belgrade would never recognise Kosovo, while Steinberg did not see it as an obstacle to progress in other areas.
A key issue was the continuation of US support for Serbia to join the EU.
"Serbia is an important partner of the United States in the region," Steinberg said, praising Belgrade for efforts to form a European future.
"The United States supports Serbia on its path to EU and WTO membership," he said.
In particular, the diplomat welcomed the Serbian parliament on March 31st that condemned the 1995 Srebrenica atrocities.
At a press conference Thursday (April 8th), Tadic and Steinberg discussed the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and agreed that a new war fear is unrest.
"The situation is dramatically, and I do not know what I can," Tadic said.
"The problems should be destroyed through stable and democratic dialogue between Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats," he said.
Tadic said Serbia does not support the idea of a divided BiH and depends on the Dayton Agreement.
"However, we think that solutions should be based on," he added.
Addressing Kosovo, Steinberg made it clear that the United States does not have to recognise Serbia.
"We do not exercise pressure, we do not threaten," he said in an interview with B92 television. "We do not encourage our position, encouraging Kosovo and the region, and that is the best thing that is to stop this problem."
The differences between Washington and Belgrade should not be an obstacle "to resolve the practical problems of Kosovo", the diplomat said.
Belgrade was the second stop of Steinberg 'tour, which includes Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.
In Pristina, he met with President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and Foreign Minister Studer Hyseni.
Steinberg also met with local Serb leaders in Gracanica, a Serb enclave of about 10km from the capital.
The United States supports "improving relations between Serbia and Kosovo", he said, noting that both of the future is in Europe.
Among other issues, Steinberg said the future of Kosovo depends on the fight against drug trafficking and organised crime.
If these problems are not closed, he said, Kosovo will doubt its success in the economic field.
"The governance, corruption and organised crime has always been tolerated and will continue to demonstrate," Thaci told Steinberg. "The rule of law in the Republic of Kosovo is a full commitment to the rule of law."
EU Commissioner Fouere: Macedonia is very early to assess its chances
SKOPJE, Macedonia -- Macedonia has yet to assess the chances of a historic chance to start EU membership talks, EU representative in Skopje Erwan Fouere said on Tuesday (August 4th).
Fouere refused to comment on the European Commission report, saying Macedonia must complete the necessary reforms and prove that it is ready to start accession talks this autumn.
While the country is important to resolve the long-term name dispute between Greece and Greece, Macedonia is vital for its EU bid, he added.
He also urged the opposition Albanian Democratic Party to avoid boycotting parliament in weeks, as threatened by the opposition Albanian Democratic Party. (A1, MRT, Alsat - 04 / 08 / 09)

Earlier this month, UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari said that Serbian authorities have sparked charges that the Serbian envoy was sympathy for ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said on Tuesday (August 29th) that the government would "operate in order to inform the international community on the Serbian people of Ahtisaari" of serious prevention on the judiciary ".
"Serbs are convicted" for crimes against Albanians in 1998 and 1999, "Ahtisaari said on 8 August, adding that the Belgrade negotiating team was told the Belgrade negotiating team.
UN secretary-general, Brandon Money, said Ahtisaari "remarks his words" and wants "to say that the envoy would not be reviewed only the historical heritage".
"The fact that we are convincing this statement is that all consequences in broad or broad consolidation are impossible.
The Serbian people are very good for these remarks, "he said.
"Everything is a lot that must pay the price," Ahtisaari said later. "Everything, he tried to announce the announcement, adding that" the new democratic government in Belgrade has not been responsible for the Kosovo policies, "he said, adding that Belgrade leaders should never be taken to the historical heritage of years."
Serbian officials have repeatedly condemned Ahtisaari.
Sandda Raskovic-Ivic, director of the Serbian Centre for Kosovo Co-operation, suggested on Monday that Serbian authorities did not want UN Secretary-General Annan Ahmeti to withdraw the status talks in the consequences of Kosovo.
Raskovic-Ivic told European Radio B92 that Ahtisaari "is convinced the Serb people of Kosovo and insisted that he is" convinced and insisting that it is "a clear manner of the Kosovo Albanian negotiators".
He was the main topic of a meeting of the Belgrade negotiating team on Monday.
The mission members said Ahtisaari "has created the post as the UN secretary-general" and said the envoy "took a serious danger to the UN special envoy for the talks on the future of Kosovo".
Kostunica is head of the Belgrade delegation, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic.
"Today, Serbia will be more accomplishing a decision on whether Ahtisaari is calling for the rest of Ahtisaari," Kostunica said at the meeting. "We will do what we will do and see the consequences of diplomatic actions."

"If Bulgaria and Romania join the EU at the beginning of next year, Britain should continue its open door policy," the BNE said in a statement. [Getty Images]
A group of leading business figures urged the British government on Tuesday (August 29th) to change the immigration policy ahead of the planned EU membership in Bulgaria and Romania in January 2007.
While a fixed debate on the issue is under way in Britain, opposition conservative profits and cabinet members are calling for restrictions that would allow the country to stop its labour market following the two Balkan countries' entry into the Union.
Britain was one of the few countries that opened the labour market in May 2004 by the end of immigrants from ten countries that joined the bloc.
The latest reports suggest that the government estimates about 13,000 people to Britain to work from these countries, while the real figure is 600,000.
The New European Business (BNE) members, who argued that the British economy is beneficial from this major workers, signed a statement Tuesday that Bulgarian and Roma should be allowed to enter the country 'labour market.
"If Bulgaria and Romania join the EU at the beginning of next year, Britain must continue its open door policy," the British daily Independent quoted the BNE as saying.
"A compromise of immigrants from these countries will stop the same remarks of the policy and will serve the interests of Britain," he said.
Independent points to the figures that Eastern European immigrants contributed to the British economy last year are equal to 2.54 billion euros.
The British economy growth in 2005 and 2006 was 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent of immigrants.
"In an interview with the BBC, for example, we see some true contributions to the labour market," Treasury Economy Minister Ed Balta said in an interview with the United Kingdom. "We have made some real contributions to the labour market in the next few months, because we have to be able to move forward, because we have to be able
The BNE has called on the government to be unprecedented, as the head of companies such as the Centrica, Centrica, Merrill Lynch, London Stock Exchange, KPMG and energy giant BP, urged the government to decide on this issue.
"We believe that Britain will decide on this issue, while we believe the economic foresee and the close historical experiences should be monitored," the group said.
Romanian President Traian Basescu said that hundreds of thousands of workers will go from his country to the EU labour market.
"In an interview with the International Herald Tribune," Basescu said in an interview. "The salary rates in private companies have been explosives in the construction sector with Romania.
We believe that the Romanian market will continue to be encouraging, so we believe the immigration will not be a problem, "he said.
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivaylo Kalfin has tried to dissolve concerns in this direction, saying Bulgarians will not threaten the British labour market after the country becomes a member of the EU.
Bulgaria rejects Libyan protests on health care workers

Bulgaria rejected an official protest on Thursday (July 26th) against a Palestinian doctor, who was estimated to ask five Bulgarian nurses who were estimated in the North Africa country earlier this week, when Libyan President Georgi Parvanov announced his decision to paramilitary prison.
"There is no legal problem on the status of the health workers who returned from Libya, and Bulgaria has fully respected the Libyan laws," Bulgarian Chief Prosecutor Boris Velchev told the Balkan country 'news agency BTA.
Health employees arrived in Sofia on Tuesday after eight years of controversial accusations that more than 400 children have been punished to HIV. On July 17th, the country was sentenced to prison sentences in prison, following a deal with high-ranking 48 hospitals in prison.
Each of the sides will be expended to around 1m euros.
Under an amendment agreement signed in 1984, five nurses and doctor -- were given him for Bulgarian citizenship -- were sent to the country to attract penalties in Bulgaria.
However, less than a hour to Sofia, the prominent Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov was ordered by Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov.
The families of children in this move called on Libyan authorities to avoid diplomatic relations with Bulgaria, to limit thousands of Bulgarian citizens who are working in the Arab country and to arrest health workers from Interpol.
The first secretary-secretary of the Bulgarian Embassy in Trablus called on the Libyan Foreign Ministry on Wednesday to take an official protest claiming Parvanov was "clear violation of the 1984 agreement".
Following the extradition of prisoners, the Bulgarian chief prosecutor said on Thursday that the country has been prevented to seek treatment by the law.
"After the medical tasks returned to Bulgaria, Libyan sentences have begun to withdraw from Bulgarian laws," Velchev said. "This is the president of the president, and this is the authority to use its authority."
Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, who rejected Trabs' allegations, said on Thursday that Libyan protests would be sent to an official response to the same day.
"Libyan response to the pressures of children in the hospitals," the BTA quoted Stanishev as saying. "The decision is necessary and isolated."
Stanishev said a day ago that Bulgaria has long been on the country of Libya, the 54m-euro debt is considering the families of children in the hospitals, many in Britain, France and Italy.
Bulgarian nurses Kristiana Vultua, Nastase Nenova, Snezhana Dimitrova, Valentina Siropulo and Valya Chervenka, as well as a very controversial case, which opened to the Palestinian doctor Etor Haduc, on Friday, has caused a major debate in the area of international relations with Libya.
Health employees argued that some of them had been taken under torture after the arrest were arrested.
International experts say the outbreak in Bengazi is likely to begin before the development of health care tasks, and the lack of hygious conditions in the facilities are insufficient.

Kosovo leaders and UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker agreed on Thursday (July 26th) that local and parliamentary elections in the province were held in November.
Following talks with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu, Ruecker said the elections could be an obstacle to the Kosovo status process, but the two process could walk together.
Sejdiu promised that authorities will "monitor the status process" to ensure that they do not affect the elections.
He stressed that the Kosovo government will continue the work of the parliamentary and negotiating team until the elections, and that institutional rhetoric is not dangerous.
In an interview with Southeast European Times, Kosovo citizens have expressed different views about the latest development.
Pristina Fersque Krasniqi said the elections should be held in November because an independent Kosovo can have a new parliamentary and government.
"After the status quo is determined, we should be different leaders, because we have no need for a state," Krasniqi, who accused the current parliament of fighting corruption and effective.
According to Tand student Vjosa Gashi, the elections must be held in November or December.
"We need elections, because we will have to do the role of a democratic country," Gashi said.
Dilscientist Skumumume Muni said last year the local elections were a mistake.
"This is an intervention in Kosovo that the democratic processes have been made," he said. "Now we are now and we hope that the general elections will be held in November.
I do not believe that November is the right date, because the status process could be bribed with the election process. "
He said that the mandate of the mandate will have to take key decisions by the end of the mandate, and that would reveal the legitimacy problems.
"I will leave the elections in October," he said. "After that, I will be more time to form the new parliamentary and government that will take over the mandate of the status process."

UN General Assistant Milosevic Says Discussions in Srebrenica
A former commander of UN soldiers in Bosnia and Herzegovina said Slobodan Milosevic had a influence on Bosnian Serb leaders until May 1993, and has been used to prevent this influence in Srebrenica in time.

A former commander of the UN forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has warned that Slobodan Milosevic, one of the persecution in the Srebrenica area in March 1993, could be a "fect traffic" here here here here.
Anti-French General Philippe Moreson said on Thursday (February 12th) that the former Yugoslav president used the effect on Bosnian Serb leaders at the time, using a possible massacre in May this year.
Milosevic faces a total of 66 counts of war crimes in three different indictments, as he allegedly played during the 1990s conflict in Croatia, BiH and Kosovo.
At the same time, 7,500 Muslim men and boys are charged with a single genocide indictment against the 1992-1995 Srebrenica massacre in BiH, including the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
UN prosecutors, who must complete the indictment against Milosevic next week, are trying to prove that the defendants have control Serb forces in BiH, so they are responsible for their atrocities.
Milosevic insists that soldiers under Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic are not responsible for war crimes in BiH.
Moreon, who served as commander of the UN peacekeeping force in BiH from September 1992 to July 1993, said the situation faced.
"It was a huge circulation.
It is something that people have taken action.
"It is not only the men, but women, the entire population of Bosnia and Herzegovina," Moreson said. "It is not a fear of preservation of pressure, not only the men.
"There was no incident."
Moreon visited the Srebrenica Muslim enclaves in BiH in March 1993, when he visited the Srebrenica massacre in BiH, regional vehicles were detained, and Bosnian Serb units began to cause food and materials.
The retired general has promised that the UN would protect them, but fears that Muslim forces were unable to end the attacks on Serb civilians.
"I know that the only person who can help me is Milosevic, and I revealed the situation," he said.
He urged the Yugoslav leader to withdraw its soldiers, warning that he would be "fearing something" in Srebrenica if the mission does not stop the attacks.
"You remind that we will be declared," he reminded to Milosevic.
According to Moreson, Milosevic was at least until May 1993, when Belgrade enjoyed a possible massacre with the embassy.
Milosevic said it should be a team for this.
"I would be able to exercise, and this is a political effect, which has been prevented in the centre.
Everything has been stopped, but do it? "he said.
Moreon '' questionnaire, "he said.
Two years later, the fears have returned to the truth and that Muslim men and boys were still unfortunately in the town, which was declared by the UN in July 1995, he said, after Srebrenica took over Bosnian Serb forces.

President Alfred Moisiu said on Thursday (November 30th) he expects various political parties to agree on electoral reform and that would make the local elections history by using constitutional powers and use the authority of the local elections.
According to sources, Moisiu will choose to 20 or 21 January.
One of the most important competition is the mayor of Tirana.
Edi Rama, a member of the opposition Socialist Party, faces Interior Minister Sokol Bldashi, who supports the ruling Democratic Party (DP).
Rama won the 2004 World Mayor Award, which has been under the mayor since 2000.
If the rest was elected, it will be the third term in the post.
Bamir Topi, head of the DP victory and head of parliament group Bamir Topi.
Topi promised that his victory would be valued by the DP to the winner in the 2005 parliamentary elections.
Bldashi reportedly will continue the minister during the campaign.
The candidates of local government are planning to campaign campaign, while the country is preparing for parliamentary elections, although the country does not have a final date.
Opposition Moisiu asked the parliamentary elections in Serbia to do in the same history with January 21st elections.
Socialists say the status issue in Kosovo could affect Albania as a potential for the elections, and that should be kept in front of the situation.
Moisiu says there is no connection between the two.
"We must not be closed to the west classes in other countries.
We have to be a sovereignty country and we should not depend on others, "he said.
The ruling and opposition parties did not find a common share on many issues related to election preparations, and the opposition wants to change the Election Law.
The OSCE mission in Tirana, meanwhile, said in a report released last week that the political climate in Albania was damaged by criticising the election process.
The report noted that reforms that must be held ahead of the local elections have stalled due to the continuation between the two main parties.

The move is aimed at promoting increasing investments in Serbia, Central Europe director Brandon Riley said at a press conference.
The IUN is particularly interested in the industrial sector, banking sector, telecommunications, public administration and energy sectors, Riley added.
A survey conducted by the E-Macedonia Macedonia case found that Internet use and computer information between Macedonian youth and the computer is too much under world standards.
The survey suggested that most students from Macedonian universities do not know that they can apply for business through the internet, and that new workers are leaving the basic MS Progress programmes at least three months.

In 2003, 72% of the population supported the country &aposs accession to the EU.
This figure was 57% in early 2011.
"The EU membership is very true to Serbia … I don ’ t think that Serbia is living and purchasing power will not be a member of the EU," Serbian economist Dejan Tripkovic, 32, told SETimes.
Today, public opinion shows a final precautionary, compared to a few years ago.
The current ruling coalition -- President Boris Tadic 'Democratic Party of Democratic Party -- won the previous elections -- and a coalition based on Serbia to open the EU.
The reduction of support for European integration has made a public debate on the agenda of many political questions. How will the public opinion on the EU membership in the first half of 2012, the public opinion on the political life of Serbia?
Representatives of the ruling coalition say they do not fear the upcoming elections.
According to them, the reduction of support for European integration is normal and the entire current EU member states in the accession process.
"We do not give up the European integration policy as independent as the beginning of the public 'house.
We believe that membership in the European Union is a state, national and economic interest and the benefits of all Serbs. "
Kolzija says the current government could not announce the benefits of membership by not enough.
"In the next period, we will work on the public to offer it better.
This is not the electoral campaign, but we have a way to simple all our capabilities to achieve our strategic EU bid as soon as possible, "he added.

The official opening of the "long-standing bank" in the world was held last month in the southern Bulgarian capital.
In an island on the city, the bank is located to a park, including a park, 111m cubic, and a capacity of 2.020 people.
The project, which responded to SETimes, tells SETimes, has stopped with a long-term bank target at the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the project, and the number of "many" were preferred because the number of "numerous".
Currently, the longest bank, which currently serves as the Guinese World Records book, is 613.13m and is in Osiecna, Poland.
The idea of this reputation was revealed by a local businessman who applied to the municipality two years ago, saying the local public wants to be sponsored by banks who are "Ada".
The park, built as a municipal park during the communist regime, has always been the former beautiful beautiful behaviour, as it is the target of both franches and destroyed actions.
Following the idea of decentralisation, the municipality will have a maximum bank, then revealed its proposal for the world 'long-standing bank and reputation.
The money has the conditions for the project, because there is no structure or a hundreds of square bank.
Therefore, the major part of the financing is the beginning of the project, which is the remaining part of the municipality.
Today, the bank has already been except from a few smaller details, and Marine is taking steps on the path of the Guinese Reconstruction.
Kasto Tankov, the chief architect of the market municipality, said that "there are two such applications -- and we can be able to send documents that prove that the Guinness is able to send a commission from the Guinness, or protect represents.
We will leave the second method, "he said.
According to Tankov, the market is not a traditional city, but it has a strategic position on the road that connects Sofia and Plovdiv.
Authorities hope that travel between the two towns will be a cheaper, defeating a park and innovation to see an excellent bank.
"We have to go to the historical books before we can go to the Coast," he adds.
The park, which has not been discovered by a few years ago, is now hosting art events and sculptures, while visitors have the opportunity to move the environment.

Kosovo, Albanian Empire Ottoman Employment
The software of the Ottoman Empire in Kosovo and Albania is an important effect on Kosovo and Albania 'relations with Turkey.
By Muhamet Brajshori for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 25 / 07 / 11
Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu "strategic deep" is facing problems in Kosovo and Albanian history. [Reuters]
Kosovo and Albania are seen as repressive in the historic books of nationalist rhetoric, and in some cases, Turkey has been repeatedly repeatedly due to the Ottoman provisions.
However, historians argue, the nationalist rally could create a long-term effect in relations with Turkey, which won reunification in the region.
The Ottoman Ottoman Empire and the historical heritage on Turkey reflects an effective judiciary affected by the Albanian nationalist nationalism, Byexhi, who is doing his doctor on Albanian nationalism, told SETimes.
"All this stage shows Europe as the Albanians' presence and Turkey as a part of the Islam since September 11th," Jazexhi said.
A starting historical book for primary schools in Kosovo is the impact of Islam on Kosovo, in part of the Ottoman era.
"The factors affecting Islamic broadcasting are pressured only by Christians, pressure on humanitarian children to Istanbul by paying territorial taxes, and consists of Islamic education, and containing the mountains of the state bodies to take place in order to secure and training," the factors affected by Islam.
In this conclusion, the Ottoman Employment is another issue of experts and historians that the Ottoman Empire is a country in Albania and Kosovo.
Jazexhi Ottomans argued that the history of Albanian nationalism has become a large Albanian territory, but also cautioned a key warning.
"The Ottomans were not Turkish, and most Albanians are Albanians.
"The Ottoman Empire and the Albanian Muslims, who have built their parts in Europe," he said.
This is also reflected by the Turkish Cypriots, which are part of the Ottoman architecture, which is part of the Ottoman summit, which includes Albanians' brother and swimming.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in Sarajevo in 2009 that "there was no Ottoman enthusiasm, but the Egypt will not see Albanian life in Egyptians," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in Sarajevo, referring to the 19th century Egypt, who managed Egypt.
However, historian Dimitriiter Koci reflects the stage of nationalism and says there is no need to restore history.
"Ottomans have worked our Albanian territory, which is unchanged," Koci said, arguing, arguing that "any changes or historical written efforts in the history are the risk of our national identity at the Communist era."
However, what is seen as a academic debate could be affected by Davutoglu, the Turkish foreign policy 'Davutoglu, which argues that Turkey' common history and cultural ties could have "a strategic degree", arguing that Turkey is used to increase its influence in the region.
Net Ukaj, for instance, doubts that "broadcast relations between Kosovo and Turkey".
"If we have fought over the five years, we have been frozen, it is the fact that we have returned to us and restored circumstances … do you have the balance of our broadcast relations in the world?" he writes.
Jazexhi cautioned that the Ottoman image could have an effect on the basis of Turkey for ethnic Albanians in the long term.
"Currently, Turkey is currently under an extraordinary policy that Ahmet Davutoglu wants to start a friendship with people in the Balkans and wants to begin.
However, a few years later, I think that Turks will likely continue to change their position on Albanian cards. "
New BiH government still rules
Political withdrawals have delayed the establishment of a new state government, about 10 months after the elections.

Despite months since the general elections, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is still unable to have a new government because of the political parties' disagreements over the BiH Council of Ministers' share of ministries.
At the end of the ongoing political clashes, the two parties -- Zlatko Lagumdzija, led by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Milorad Dodik, the Independent Social Democratic Alliance of Independent Social Democratic Alliance (SNSD) -- have stalled over the government.
In addition, SDP candidate and Council of Ministers Chairman Slavko Kukic failed to win the support of the delegation of Republika Srpska (RS).
Most of the RS party representatives voted against Kukic, including members of the main Croatian parties, HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990, and members of the Party of BiH, led by Haris Silajdzic.
Kukic supported more than half of lawmakers in the first round on June 29th and July 14th, but the constitution did not get a third of RS lawmakers in the constitution to appoint the BiH Council of Ministers.
"Everything about the impression reflects the part of the BiH political scene and that the state will live the early challenge.
BiH has made a great need for fulfilling the tasks envisioned by the EU in order to make progress in Euro-Atlantic processes, "he said.
Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) President Mladen Ivanic says the parties that have frozen each other are not interested in forming the government.
"I do not think the state government will be formed by the end of the year," Ivanic told SETimes.
Ivanic believes the state government will not be formed until the state budget deficit deficits Lagumdzija and Dodik had to reach an agreement.
"We expect serious economic problems and serious funding by the end of the year.
"We can expect a serious debate on the formation of the government, since the IMF is committed to the establishment of a new credit language to BiH," he said.
However, political analyst Tanja Topic believes the recent talks show the government will soon be established.
Topic says the leaders are not sincerely searching a solution on the new government, but the political crisis should find a way from the political crisis.
According to Topic, the SDP is the highest risk of loss in the elections, and there is no reason for the principles because BiH lost its chances to make the future.
"If the SDP, HDZ and SNSD have repeatedly reached a compromise on building a new government, then BiH has lost 10 months and then the agreement is not reached," Topic told SETimes.

Albania wants to privatise its main state-owned state-owned enterprises with Colonel Telecom and Albania 'Petroleum Rafinet (ARMO) company to begin in April.
The government said the privatisation of public property would be the main goals this year.
According to Economy Minister Anastas Angjak, who met with the State Department for transparency and Privatisation, four firms were sold to ARMO, while Colonel Telecom was selected.
"The transformation and restructuring process, which these companies have been in the past four years, is possible to consolidate the consolidation of the economy and financial activities.
Under the law adopted by the government, these assets will be submitted to an international open tender to be privatised by foreign investors, "he said.
The economy, transport and industrial ministries are working together with international advisers and the entities.
The company, which won the tender for Coltelecom, is expected to win a 51 per cent stake in the company.
More than 51 per cent of the ARMO will not buy shares.
ARMO is also responsible for the oil refineries in Ballsh and Fier, as well as the retail and retail operations.
According to Angjal, Colonel Telekom envisions about 16.1m euros in 2005.

Do you think that BiH will have the political architecture?
The negative report from Brussels showed that the country has shown the west in the country, but doubts that it would lead to change.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule assessed the EC progress reports. [Reuters]
Authorities agree that the European Commission (EC) latest assessment on the road to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is one of the most critical assessments so far.
"The EC report shows that all areas that the state must make efforts to boost the EU integration process are unilateral and detailed," European Integration Director Nevenka Savic told SETimes.
The report, presented on Wednesday (October 12th), points out that a functioning government is still an important obstacle.
The situation in politics, economic and security is critical, and BiH politicians have no common vision on how to do, the document said.
In addition to the fight against organised crime, the EC said, the economic and administrative reforms and the improvement of human rights improvements in the field of human rights.
The report described the pace of implementation of reforms as "very slow".
Otherwise, the stamp spot is pushing for the removal of visa liberalisation with the Schengen supervision and the start of structural dialogue with the EU on judicial reform.
How will the negative reports from Brussels?
The majority has no doubt.
"The majority of the people have more forced, and the EU visa-free is spent on the agenda of politics," political analyst Vedran Cihic said. "At the same time, BiH has offered the political architecture as a normal crisis, while the political architecture is in line with their own national popularity."
"I think the authorities have no loss from the report, and I think they are very satisfied.
Relations in BiH, especially in Republika Srpska, are willing to be monitored for the people that they can be easy, "he said.
"The impression that will be removed here is that BiH will not be able to enter the EU ten years if it comes to this pace," Sarajevo commentator Senad Pecanin said.
According to Pecanin, a part of the problem is that the citizens are unable to combat the economic battle until they do not allow it to do.
According to him, warnings from Brussels are increasingly affected by the public and they do not exercise political impression.
"People cannot know how much half of the people can live, while the EU membership issue is a matter that the public will not pressure on the ruling Pecanin," Pecanin said.
Nevertheless, citizens of SETimes told SETimes that they are unable to stay on the prospects of change, but the situation is concerned.
"All countries in the region are only in BiH," said Haris Halilovic, a widespread representative in Sarajevo. "The national interests are not in this country, as long as the national interests come from individual and civilian rights."

EU security chief Javier Solana and Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn called on Monday (December 12th) to establish a new EU force that would play a greater role in the province, including to assume police functions, after the final status of Kosovo is determined.
The report is the first time in June, when a EU police mission was revealed the idea of establishing a EU police mission.
On Monday, the document presented EU foreign ministers in Brussels to discuss the prospects of EU enlargement in the Balkans.
"The EU can take responsibility for the rule of police and the rule of law," Reuters quoted the report as saying. "A possible ESDP [security and defence] mission on police and the rule of law should be launched for the mission."
At the same time, the two officials also called on the bloc to help strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo by prosecutors, judges and prison staff to strengthen the rule of law and provide more assistance to the reduction of more than 50 per cent in the province.
Rehn and Solana, however, stressed that the bloc is not intended to complete the mandate of the UN mission, which is now in the province with the supervision of civilian administrative tasks, which are now under way.
Authorities said the bloc would not create a "EUMIK".
At the same time, authorities also warned that the EU 'role in Kosovo is likely to bring a major concept for the 2013 budget, which has led to tensions within the bloc.
"In part of the future international presence of the EU, any interim civilian administration in order to ensure the implementation of the status agreement, as well as for a ESDP funding for police and the rule of law," EU officials said, urging authorities to provide enough funding to the budget.
The financial effect will likely be assessed by EU leaders, who have failed to reach an agreement on the long-term financing of the bloc so far.
The current stalemate has created an effect on the Balkan policy, while Macedonia seems to be delayed due to budget concerns over candidate status.
However, Rehn told reporters on Friday that the Union would not be able to join the province because Kosovo "is so important for stability in the Western Balkans".
Rehn and Solana suggested that if the status issue is resolved, a European fund for Kosovo should be resolved.
Officials, however, said the EU role will focus on the way of the status talks, which would have to be extended to full independence of the ethnic Albanian majority, with demands for continuing sovereignty of Serbia.

The Serbian police union has also been seeking better working conditions and salaries, while strikes began last week are under way.
Police also want a new massive contract, organising reform and new universities.
"The interior ministry has shown our demands, but the finance ministry has blocked the implementation of this," Veljko Mijikovic, head of the Serbian Police Union, told SETimes.
Following two years, Mijikovic said the union has warned that police officers do not have sufficient exchange service.
"Although a new approach is approaching, police officers are not always removed," Mijikovic said.
While the head of the concern, the head of the public said there is no other way for the problems.
Serbian Interior Ministry data shows that the average salary of police officers is between 350 and 400 euros.
This security service should have about 59,000 employees, according to normal and standards, while 45,000 employees have the main work.
Nevertheless, more than 1,000 police officers in Belgrade have the deficit.
The Serbian Police Union has around 15,000 members.
They also demand the government to change the police law.
Mijikovic said the union wants the government to organise the system of police employees, because it would not be a salary increase in 2012.
Still, it is demanding enough wage for the presence.
During the Grev, ID, passport and other documents are only in emergency areas, and border crossings are working with low personnel.
Police Director Milorad Veljovic believes the division is unfair and demands.
"The state is the importance of the police to protect security.
Police are protecting all investigation and administrative border crossings, and the high risk meetings are always called for security and protection, "he said.
SP praises end boycott, doubts
The Albanian opposition ended a two-year parliamentary boycott, but competition between the ruling DP and the DP is under way.

Although the Socialist Party ended the parliamentary boycott in Albania, there are doubts that Albania will return to the reform path. [Reuters]
The Socialist Party in Albania last month ended a parliamentary boycott after the ongoing protest and strike strike in two years, but it is seen as insufficient and delayed action.
In the European Commission (EC) Report on Progress (EC) published last month, Albania has not proposed EU candidate status for the country.
The EC pointed out that the SP 'parliamentary boycott has contributed to slowdown reforms, while the opposition is responsible for the government.
"Instead of making reforms to increase Democracy standards, Albania is a pre-democracy period," SP lawmaker Ditmir Busati told SETimes.
However, the SP said the return to parliament does not mean untrue support for the bill sent to parliament.
"Our task is not to express parliamentary statistics on whether the government voted in the initiatives of the law," SP Deputy President Saimir Tahiri told SETimes.
We want to move forward and this time there is a real parliamentary initiative that will turn EU recommendations to a concrete working plan, "he said.
The opposition submitted a proposal that covers ten areas, including the appointment of independent institutions such as government reform -- the ombudsman and the headquarters of the central bank -- to reach a compromise.
"Our task is not working as we are working, but the Albanian people are working hard to find real solutions," Tahiri said.
However, the party has been talking about the union, and the government has led to reform, but the SP is not strong, and the party is questioning the unity.
According to former SP leader Fatos Nano, the party is not serious in efforts to reform.
"Only one image [offers]," Nano said.
Meanwhile, Alexander Cipa said the divisions within the party would affect the party 'ability.
"The opposition, led by the Rama opposition, is a position that the lack of optimism and solidarity has been made as clear," Cipa told SETimes.
"The problem is what is the decision to return to the parliament.
These signals are mixed and cafe, such as the SP leadership, "he said.
"The opposition is undermining its image of the country, reforms and [EU] integration process," he said.
Nevertheless, the end of the boycott is believed to be more streamlined to Albania 'political stalemate.
"The opposition is very simply that there will be a lot of democratic dialogue: a simple democratic dialogue, the street," journalist Mustafa Nano told SETimes.
However, Nano said the situation could be a positive side.
"The parliament will be approved due to a number of laws, domestic and external pressure, which both parties need a compromise.
However, this is not a small reputation, because the decline between the majority and the opposition will remain the same. "

Representatives of the European Parliament (European Free Alliance) group in Istanbul from October 19th to October 22nd, the representatives of the European Parliament organised a conference on Turkey &aposs EU membership.
The forum, the first conference organised by a European party on Turkish territory, focused on the challenges that the Union is trying to meet membership criteria.

Daniel Cohn-Byst, the head of the Judges / EFA group, who described the post-German consensus and post-communist integration -- as Ren and Oder, said Turkey &aposs participation would be equal.
"I hope that we will recognise one of the 10 or 15 years, and we will recognise the Bogazz conservative," Cohn-Byst said.
At the same time, Cohn-Byst said Turkish politicians should accept the country 'need to be special treatment by the EU.
"Turkey has a population of 70 million people and is an important country for Europe.
However, Turkey ’ s accession to the EU cannot meet with Malta or Bulgaria or Bosnia and Herzegovina 'accession.
This will be difficult for both Turkey and the EU, and both sides must be honoured on this issue, "he said.
The conference focused on various issues Turkey faces, including women rights, sites, freedom of expression, media freedom, environmental problems, torture and the treatment of Kurdish, Armenian and Christian communities.
The participants acknowledged that Turkey has made conservative changes over the past two years, but most of the reforms still have problems.
The head of the EU and the Turkish Common Parliament, Joost Lagizjk, said reforms and security are key to Turkey 'membership.
Although the criteria for opening accession talks are met, he said, it does not mean that the criteria are completely met.
The Judges / EFA group, which confirmed support for Turkish membership bid, said that human rights, democracy and women will continue to monitor Turkey 'behaviour, noting that it is especially in the society.

Since January 1st, Montenegro has the right to export liberalisation of EU member states.
So far, however, there has been a little amount and exported.
Furthermore, there is a substantial dispute about the potential of the sector.
Among the type of passengers argued that Montenegro can export the value of 1.5m euros, most of the fisheries do not find this goal.
Around 130,000 tonnes of tonnes in Montenegrin cars, according to experts from the Denmark Byology Institute in Kotor, said work with his colleagues from Ancona, Italy.
According to textile head Mladen Mandic, this means that 30,000 tonnes will be removed this year.
This year, 29,000 tonnes of tonnes, and this is 36.
However, the actual amount of the balance is too far under the figure.
According to Montenegrin and Italian experts, researchers show the existing concert capacity is too far.
To resolve the problem, the Ribarstvo fiscal production and the concert factory plans to implement a series of projects designed to increase the capacity for ten times.
Among them, a female couple is a farm.
About 300 people are working at the beginning, while the figure will reach 1,200 people in three to four years.
The Montenegrin Agriculture Ministry, meanwhile, has allocated 97,000 euros to develop fiscal development this year.
According to Marko Kapin, head of the Association of Professor Balicians, the biggest problem is the lack of a development strategy.
According to Kapki, Montenegro is currently in place to win 1.5 million euros annually from its fiscal exports, but some fears that purchase expensive waste are not enough to make the amount of frequently.
In addition, he said, Montenegro is facing obstacles such as the high level of license fees and insufficient insufficient.
Even though 30,000 tonnes of tonnes are possible, representatives of the fiscal sector warn that this figure would mean excessive excession.
In addition, Montenegro must find the local markets.
Although Italy is a delay, fears who are trying to enter the Belgrade market have frozen with transport problems -- the fiscal can reach 48 hours.
In Montenegro, the fiscal exports still limit in the pension period, all sides agree that research and experience projects should be done to assess the potential of the sector and find ways to use it by the end of the year.

Delevic: reforms must be needed for Serbia 'interest
The head of the country ’ s European Integration Open, says more than EU membership is at risk.
By Bojana Milovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 05 / 09 / 11

The arrest of Serbia, Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic was one of the most important obstacles to EU membership.
The process, however, could be more complicated than Serbs' hope.
There are many expectations to be fulfilled, as well as the pace of reform laws.
Meanwhile, some EU leaders -- particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- agree that Serbia &aposs EU aspirations, progress in bilateral talks with Kosovo, and a solution to the north of Kosovo.
A recent survey by the government &aposs European Integration Opposition suggests that citizens who support EU membership in a possible referendum are four points.
This rate, which was 57 per cent ago, was 53 per cent today.
Belgrade is still amended on October 12th, when the European Commission is due to release its assessment on whether Serbia is ready to become an official candidate.
Milica Delevic, head of the European Integration Company, told SETimes that questions about the overall situation.
SETimes: Do you satisfied with the support of Serbian citizens in the European integration process? How do you think the decline in the Support?
Milica Delevic: People are no longer an idea of the views of the EU, but the high level of support has shown that Serbia 'progress in its EU membership route will be beneficial for both the country and themselves.
The positive NATO membership is a matter of protecting the assassination of Serbia. [Reuters]
Currently, there is a high support.
Our support for reforms is very important to support EU membership.
Eight per cent of the citizens think the reforms should be implemented, not for the EU, but for our own partner, the rate was around 73 per cent earlier this month.
I would like to see our citizens in the case: I am very important that Serbia continues to move towards European integration, it is a process that guarantees the reforms they want to see citizens.
SETimes: The possibility of recognition of Serbia for EU membership is a key issue of hundreds of political climate in Europe and Serbia.
What is the truth?
Delevic: Serbia has been defined in the framework of stability and enlargement process, as well as the conditions, human and minority rights, the democratic principles of the rule of law, a functional market market economy and the implementation of the EU legal heritage.
First, regional co-operation is a special importance to fulfil the obligations that are in line with international agreements we are entitled.
Kosovo has not been revealed as an official nomination, but it could be seen as a deeper element of the political climate that would open the way for the process in Serbia and the EU.
There is no idea that Kosovo is not a state in the EU, but Kosovo is clear that everyone should participate in regional co-operation and partnership processes with the EU.
SETimes: One of the sensitive issues in the Serbian political scene is that NATO membership is a precondition for EU membership.
How do you assess this issue?
Delevic: The majority of the EU member states are also members of NATO, but some of them fear their discrimination.
Serbia is ready to take responsibility for regional and global security, and will have to understand the difference between the Alliance and a non-NATO country, which is part of an extraordinary relations with NATO.

SETimes: Serbia hopes to win a positive response from the EC on 12 October and win candidate status.
Do you need Serbia to do so?
Delevic: There is many things that Serbia must do this issue, and I believe it will be done until the European Commission decision on October 12th on the candidate country status.
However, I would not see the candidate country status as a huge value that will change everything.
This decision will be an evaluation that we are under way in some reform processes, and the Commission will be passed until certain laws are being made, and will be implemented by how the laws are being implemented, which will not be the end of the work.
It would be wrong to expect Serbia to become a completely system.
Currently, the most important thing for us is to work to get a symbolic rating, as the EC assesses.
The assessment will affect the decision by EU ministers, state heads and governments on December 9th.
SETimes: What is the capture of Ratko Mladic, the process of European integration of Serbia?
Delevic: The political climate has changed, and a key official official was met.
I see this as an important thing in line with European integration, and I think that Mladic is crucial to the arrest of serious crimes.
The arrest also showed our stance on international obligations and our commitment to the rule of law, while we believe that any crimes will not be punished and priority goals, regional reconciliation and stability, which is our priority goals.
SETimes: The Netherlands was one of the most violent advocates for Serbia 'suspension of the European integration process until Mladic is arrested.
Although Mladic was arrested, Serbia and the EU have yet to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
How do you see such a message with the Netherlands?
Delevic: I expect Ben Netherlands to approve this document.
I think that we have done many things as the country, and I think the Dutch parliamentary deputies will have it.
However, the only country that has blocked the accord is not the Netherlands, but there are many countries that do not approve the agreement.
SETimes: Many say Serbia will not be taken into EU membership in the next expansion of enlargement due to the serious crisis and discrimination environment in the EU.
How do you respond to these suspects?
Delevic: The economic crisis and internal political circumstances in member states will now affect the stalemate of the economic crisis and internal political circumstances, however, that the crisis will be very serious, and I think that this crisis is a danger that the EU is rising its presence, or that the Union is in accordance with the strategic interests of the Western Balkan countries.

The EU-Balkans summit in Brdo, Slovenia, will take place as some of the judges are planned, the Brussels news service Euobserver reported on Tuesday (March 16th).
The news came in mid-18 years when leaders of all former Yugoslav republics gathered Saturday 'meeting with the leaders of Albania, were said to be cancelled after Serbia threatened to boycott the meeting in the Kosovo process as an independent state.
Serbian President Boris Tadic said his country will participate in any regional conference, including the UN Security Council Resolution 1244.
"A regional conference cannot represent the most recognition of Kosovo [independence]," Tadic told reporters after a meeting with Hungarian President Laszlo Solyom in Novi Sad on Sunday.
He insisted that Kosovo, recognised by 65 countries in the world, including most EU member states and the Balkan countries in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Romania, should participate in international forums under UNMIK.
However, Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said last week that the Brdo meeting would only participate as a representative of an independent state.
"The European Union is also a delegation for the Western Balkans: Slovenia and Croatia hold a conference that will take place under the" European Future Caths ".
EU Council President Herman von Rompuy, as well as Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Anberinos Moratinos, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
Spain is one of the five members of the 27-nation bloc not recognised Kosovo.
Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor said last week that the region is intended to promote EU membership targets and to "seek a solution" to some problems.
The organisers want the summit to end a joint declaration on "the Western Balkans" with the European perspective, Pohor added.
Serbia, which submitted its official application for EU membership in December, has warned that the bloc has been falling from capital rhetoric rhetoric rhetoric about Kosovo, the Euobserver reported.
"Serbia will cause a lot of questions that the opportunity to decide on whether Kosovo can participate in international and regional forums," a senior EU diplomat Euobserver quoted a senior EU diplomat as saying. "In the past, we are now tolerating it."
A week before the Brdo meeting, the leader of the pro-European Liberal Democratic Party of Serbia, Cedomir Jovanovic, urged Tadic to meet with Kosovo leaders, as well as a good liberalisation.
"We must fight to live instead of the war," Belgrade-based B92 quoted Jovanovic as saying.

The Public Revenues Agency (KGD) failed to pay thousands of people in Macedonia this month, due to the skills of the "bronze salary" system ".
Among the networks, the two main islands were the presidential competition.
According to the paper, the ruling VMRO-DPMNE and the opposition Social Democrats, Georgi Ivanov and Ljubomir Frecoski, respectively for candidates of the opposition Social Democrats, did not get their salaries by December and January.
Both are participating in legal professor at the University of Skopje.
Macedonians have no money in front, as well as the payment of payments and interest payments, as well as in their front.
According to local media estimates, about 600,000 citizens are average of 1800 euros to banks, while the voluntary has no arguments against the penalties of payments.
The situation is still unprecedented in mid-February, but the KGD is still unlikely. As of February 15th, 60,000 registered workers in the country have said they pay insurance surprises and salaries.
The government believed to improve transparency of the new system and make it difficult to pay employees' contributions to the difficult pension and health insurance, because they will face penalties and even the KGD conscription of the payments that contributed to 15 months, as they will face penalties and circumstances to the jobs.
If the system is seen in the season of the system, the government has not made the threats of the threat, and the government has sentenced some 5,000 punishments to businesses, which do not submit their obligations until February 15th.
The charges were spread.
The finance ministry criticised the employees to submit the debt estimates in January.
Still, the company has not confirmed that the disease software ware 'aims to comply with the KGD programme.
Meanwhile, widespread managers claim that the KGD software software is not a study, but the companies' huge debt is the bloc.
On February 11th, the success of parliamentary confidence was shot as one of the reasons for the salary circumstances, and the largest union of the country, Finance Minister Trajko Slavic, asked.
Nevertheless, the government advocates technology.
Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavreski described the system as "valuable, sustainable and transparent", while insisting that almost all European countries "have this.
Stavreski said the government will be able to deal with problems.
Serbia-Montenegro Says Armed Forces
As part of a comprehensive military reform, the Serbia-Montenegro Army plans to increase more than 9,000 officers this year.
Given the overall unemployment rate, this move could be an additional pressure on the government to improve the economic situation.

According to the army reform plan, the total number of members of the Serbia-Montenegro Army will be reduced to 39,000 from 7,900 to 2010. [AFP]
Serbia-Montenegro will have 9,300 military officers this year as part of its efforts to comply with NATO standards, the defence ministry announced on Sunday (May 29th).
In Serbia, a total of 1,400 professional soldiers and 5,300 civilian workers, while the number of professional soldiers and NGOs will be reduced by 1,800 and 800.
A group of workers in the first phase will be enough, the ministry said, adding that the privatisation of some facilities would be part of the privatisation of the first phase.
In early April, 4,200 civilians and 1,300 officers were discovered in Serbia. The size of the Serbia-Montenegro Army will be reduced to 39,722 people by 2010.
According to Serbia-Montenegro Defence Minister Prvoslav Davinic, the reduction of the number of Serbian government and military personnel is under an agreement between the IMF, which is essential to support reforms.
Davinic said the Serbian Ministry of Finance in January that 6,500 people from the army budget were falling from the military budget.
"Those who have not been dismissed are still in the budget, and this is a lot," Davinic said.
The reform in Serbia will be very accomplished with the overall unemployment rate.
According to official data, 800,000 people in Serbia do not work.
The government and the army have no specific social programmes for the jobs, and it is not new workers.
Following the army, they will receive an annual salary between 4,000 and 6,500 euros.
Following his request, they will receive 20 per cent.
A spokesperson for civilian employees, Vladimir Stanimirovic, says the state has failed to protect the clients, because these people will not appear other from the defence ministry, which has brought themselves.
Stanimirovic said he would apply to international institutions and courts with the hope that "decisions to overcome the work".
So far, only 270 of the interests of the jobs have been appealed to the military commission, and they returned to their jobs.
This year, in addition to reducing the army, the privatisation of major public enterprises -- is expected to result in the process.
As a result, I hope the government will increase social pressure.
EULEX, Belgrade officials discuss rule of law in Kosovo

EULEX chief Yves de Kermabon met with Belgrade officials on Wednesday (March 3rd) to discuss strengthening the rule of law in Kosovo.
De Kermabon met with Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic and State Secretary Slobodan Homen in Mitrovica on ways to bring the courts to restore.
"Both sides agreed that talks on improving the rule of law in Kosovo are the top, positive and constructive," EULEX said in a press release.
"The fact that it is acceptable to all communities in justice, justice, business and customs areas," he said.
EULEX confirmed that "a number of confidence measures" to achieve functional solutions "are discussed, and" the team meetings will be held in particular, especially justice ".
"It is an urgent need to improve the rule of law in the north of Kosovo, and the best way for progress is to find pragmatic solutions," the EU mission said.
According to Bogdanovic, the EU mission supports the plan for the Serb majority northern Kosovo.
The proposal, adopted by the International Civilian Office in Kosovo (ICO) and the Kosovo government, envisions the disbursement of parallel structures supported by Belgrade.
"De Kermabon said on Wednesday that EULEX and the EU will not support solutions based in northern Kosovo," Belgrade-based RTV quoted Bogdanovic as saying after a meeting.
De Kermabon told the Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti earlier this month that the ICO plan is not a EULEX strategy.
"We believe progress in northern Kosovo can be achieved only through dialogue," De Kermabon said.
Bogdanovic said the talks focused on the establishment of a EULEX / Serbian government "joint working group, which will cover technical questions in customs, justice and business areas".
EULEX, however, rejected an agreement on such working groups on Wednesday.
"There is no agreement on the establishment of working groups in justice and business areas," the mission said. "The meeting focused on the normalisation of courts in Mitrovica."
Homen told the Serbian media that "the need to operate on war crimes, the importance of the fight against organised crime and talks on documentary exchange for almost two years".
"We have made a time when we are preparing to enhance war crimes, but we need EULEX assistance," Belgrade-based B92 quoted Homen as saying.
Ahead of the talks with De Kermabon, Bogdanovic said certain issues reflecting the Serbian media are inevitable.
He cited "implementation of the police protocol on customs issues and the exchange of goods and capital."
EULEX confirmed that no one of these issues was discussed.
Bulgaria hopes to join Eurozone in mid-2013
One of the preliminary requirements to enter the Eurozone is to join the District Board II.
Bulgaria plans to apply in November.
(Reuters, AFP, DPA, Novinite, BNR, Dnevnik - 03 / 08 / 09; Bloomberg, Dnevnik, BNN - 31 / 07 / 09)
Bulgaria could spend the euro within four years. [File]
In an interview published by the Sofia daily Simeon Cankov on Monday (August 3rd), Finance Minister Simeon Cankov said Bulgaria could enter the euro in mid-2013.
"We have the chance of the [government] for a four-year mandate to get the euro in the end of the year," Cankov said.
Cankov, a former World Bank economist, also serves as the deputy prime minister at the Bulgarian cabinet for European Development (GERB) on July 27th.
Bulgaria must join the European Investment Administration (EII), which currently holds the 16 EU countries as an official foreign currency board, before it is currently holding the euro as a test of a two-year currency unit for candidate countries.
Cankov said last week that Sofia plans to submit its application for membership in November.
"There is a great uncertainty in terms of the financial crisis that the region is in the entire region," Bloomberg news agency quoted him as saying. "This application cannot affect our application, but it can affect the pace of evaluation."
Cankov believes Bulgaria could fulfil the accession criteria by the end of the year.
The most important task is now to keep the budget deficit under 3% of the GDP (GDP), the minister said.
"We are now 2.2% (budget deficit)...
If 33% of the number, the euro participation will have to postpone more than two years, "he said.
Cankov also suggested inflation rates will continue to drop to 2.8% this year from 3.7% in June.
In 1997, Bulgaria was a decline in GDP and personal income revenues, the country &aposs banking sector, and an economic and financial crisis that caused serious foreign currency problems.
Following several months of decades, the country has implemented a foreign currency arrangement with 1.953 of the fraud.
Bulgaria could allow the ERM to enter the ERM II to allow the centre to lose 15% of this centre.

De Kermabon met with Thaci to discuss the issue.
"[De Kermabon] assured that EULEX has not met on the name of Kosovo institutions and that there is no right to do so," he said.
"EULEX does not meet with Belgrade," De Kermabon said in a press release.
"Belgrade, Tirana, Skopje and Podgorica have made technical meetings on fighting organised crime and smuggling and improving information in justice, customs and police areas."

"Everything is in full transparency.
De Kermabon is continued with the deputy prime minister.
I am convinced that this will be completely in accordance with the position of Kosovo authorities, "he said.
"Discussions with Belgrade are not the same with Tirana.
Pristina notes that one remains on Belgrade and Kosovo.
In addition, we should accept a psychological, and we should not agree on such contacts, "Bay Feith and others respond to local representatives and international representatives in Kosovo, even of special visits to Belgrade."

The main goal of CEFTA is to develop economic relations between member states. [CEFTA]
The country signed the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) in September, saying it would end its status to the only region that does not do so, the Serbian Economy Ministry announced earlier this week.
Serbian Economy and Regional Development Ministry Secretary-General Jasna Matic said on Monday (June 4th) that obstacles between Serbia and Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia -- including imports and export taxes -- the Parliament could accept the necessary bill to ratify the agreement.
According to the agreement, the main goal of the CEFTA is to "liberalise bilateral trade relations as a labour and abolish tax and tax obstacles on trade in the transition period and to create a free trade zone."
"While the CEFTA is a member of the CEFTA, Serbia will take the most benefit from the so-called contract that allows the goods produced in some CEFTA member states to be exported to the EU market," Matic said.
With the export market, CEFTA members -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro and Kosovo -- accepted the action plan for the tobacco sector, approved in March.
The plan, which envisions the diversification of consumption tax on local and foreign smokers from 1 January 2008, will be implemented by 2012 to organise relations between the state and the tobacco industrial industry.
The document aims to improve the decline of the tobacco industrial industry, increase exports of tobacco products and improving tobacco production.
The discrimination is eliminating consumption, providing equal treatment of domestic and foreign smoking brings.
In addition, the current challenge on the procurement of domestic tobacco has been eliminated, companies can buy them from abroad to 20%.
The tobacco factories in Serbia are satisfied with the situation and say it is encouraging investments in Serbia.
Eugenio Sidoli, director of the DIN cigarette factory in Philip Morris, in the city of Nis, said the plan would increase the cost of smoking products, but will be able to address the market conditions and the amendments in business policy.
"There is a significant amount of consumption from 2012 to 2012, because it will increase exports in the tobacco sector, and to encourage farmers to produce a greater amount of consumption and encourage better products," said Economy Minister Milan Parivodic.
Since 2003, four tobacco companies have invested around 1 billion euros in the tobacco industry of Serbia.
Parivoc said the plan allows CEFTA to become a cabinet, and has ordered the country to launch talks on the World Trade Organisation.

Although parliament approved human rights reforms, journalists continue to arrest and sentence in 2003.
Critics say the problem is corruption and monopoly.
Most of the newspapers in the country have been kept by strong media barricades that are linked to the political influence and the banking sector.
According to the Turkish Journalists' Association of Journalists, the media -- a third of the country -- has also attracted the media in the west of corruption.
A total of 28 national newspapers in Turkey.
The 16 of them are also below three groups that are under control of Turkey &aposs largest television channels.

Furthermore, the data shows that many people have already entered the laws in order to ensure a better life in the West.
Many of the illegal immigrants questioned by police say they are economic.
Observers come from various states and even different disasters.

Greece is also a popular path for fugitives who want to enter Italian ports, but also a popular point for fugitives who want to enter illegal enterprises.
Police say three rockets were used as overall in the EU countries.
Of them, Macedonia is beginning and it is used to enter Italy via Greece.

Macedonian police have become more successful on the facility of smugglers.

British immigrant office officials say the country is only 15 cases or illegal sites in 2005, in which Macedonian nationals were involved in 2005.
Serbian government faces deepening crisis
The Serbian government entered the greatest political crisis on Wednesday, as a result of the country ’ s pro-European president and the nationalist prime minister on the EU plans and the future of Kosovo.

"I am regret that certain politicians in Belgrade do not block the signing of the signing," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [Getty Images]
About nine months of Serbia 'government arrived on Wednesday (February 6th), when the country' nationalist prime minister blocked a new EU agreement that supports the pro-European ministers in the coalition cabinet.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica cancelled a type of meeting Thursday, planned before the government approved a interim political agreement with Brussels on the same day.
Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic has signed an agreement with the EU on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, but pro-Western President Boris Tadic had not signed an agreement to Serbia ahead of the resignation of Sunday.
Kostunica, who has been critical of the Kosovo independence of Kosovo, described the 27-nation bloc 'new proposal as a "deeper" that cautioned Serbia on the path to the province.
The prime minister, who fears Tadic ’ s Democratic Party (DS) and the G17 Plus' approval of the EU agreement, refused to call for a meeting on Monday, insisting that the issue would be held at an urgent parliamentary meeting.
DS member and Parliament Speaker Oliver Dulic dismissed the prime minister, saying the parliament meeting would only decide after the government announced its official stance for the signing of a political agreement with the EU.
Tadic believes the future of Kosovo is in the EU, but believes the country is in the EU and supported an interim agreement on the issues of political dialogue, free trade, visa liberalisation and education.
On Wednesday, he urged Kostunica to hold a cabinet meeting to achieve a joint stance on the issue.
"In order to protect the stability of the state, all state institutions should not be allowed to do their work because of the party positions," Tadic said on Wednesday.
"The government must work on the interest of citizens," Tadic said, adding that Kostunica reminded that the government is in charge of dealing with the Serbian constitution and implementing its policy. "
"No one of the Serbian government is committed to the good intention of nobody, nor the Serbian parliament can replace the government of Serbia," the president said. "Everything has been defined with the constitution and laws."
Celic and 16 other government ministers, meanwhile, have signed a letter to Kostunica, who wants the cabinet to do the heart of Thursday.
The only attitude of the government has made it clear that this will not happen.
Following a move by Kostunica to block the signing of the agreement, Brussels has decided to postpone the agreement, but it would stop until it is ready to sign Belgrade.
"I would like to say that certain politicians in Belgrade are deeply fulfilling the signing of the signal," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in Brussels on Wednesday. "I think that Serbia is a better and better life in the future of the European future.
"It is really realistic for Serbia, which politicians continue to continue to prevent their interests of their own citizens."
Serbian analysts have warned that the current institutional crisis could fall the government and cause early elections.

According to the Agriculture ministry, Macedonia could now seek international protection through bilateral agreements with import countries.
The Slovenian company, however, says a Slovenian company is trying to take the explosion of this product in Germany.

In Skopje, however, it does not exist.
"The Macedonian government is trying to make it a unique product in the world," government spokesman Ivica Bocevski said. "The Market consensus will allow it to meet with the standards of the monopoly and be allowed to lose the licenses.
This will guarantee quality and competitiveness in the world markets. "
The government has formed a working group to prepare protocos on agriculture and production.
Prosecutors will have to send the number of Technology and Metalurgy Foundation for a year to comply with rules and send the quality control.
Macedonian authorities acknowledge that the presence is produced in many countries under different islands.
However, when it comes to "the Macedonian Black Sea", the quality of the state institutions claim they want to protect a traditional and local language.

Slovenia announced on Tuesday (February 5th) that Croatia opposes the frequent destruction (ZERP), which was implemented at the beginning of the year.
EU members have become a key point of dispute affecting Slovenia and Italy.
Despite intensive consequences between diplomats and officials, a solution accepted both sides has not been resolved.
The territorial dispute between Croatia and Slovenia is more complicated.
Earlier this week, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said Slovenia, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, is an obstacle to the accession process, due to this dispute.
According to Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa, however, Croatia did not fulfil the conditions for opening talks on the fiscal chapter.
"We have not been blocking the negotiations on the Fiscation, which is more Slovenia," Jansa said on Tuesday.
He insisted that both sides could be acceptable to a solution.
He said he wants to meet with Sanader, but if Italy joined.
"The meeting is not only between Ljubljana and Zagreb, but also in the same framework of the agreement between the European Commission -- co-operation and the participation of the European Commission in 2004," Slovenian leader told reporters.
The ZERP issue has threatened to slow Croatia &aposs EU accession process at a time when it is ready to move forward.
A delegation headed by the European Parliament &aposs Croatia rapporteur, Hannes Swoboda, arrived in Zagreb this week.
During his meeting with Sanader, Swoboda said Croatia could complete its EU accession process by the end of 2009.
Sanader said his government hopes to complete its "majority of the workers" this year.
However, the dispute with Slovenia could continue to prevent some negotiating chapters.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged the dispute to avoid tension of the entities and to make serious efforts to find a "political solution" within a European consensus and good neighbourly relations.
Last week, Croatian President Stipe Mesic met with Slovenian counterpart Danilo Turk in a bid to destroy the situation.
They called on the governments to resolve the dispute and to address the problems.
"We must avoid statements that have to be imposed and negative and negative, and not in our dialogue," Turk said after a meeting on February 1st.
"It is clear that our relations with Slovenia should be a good problem than a few open problems," Mesic said, adding that Zagreb and Ljubljana should talk about issues on the sidelines.

Two months ago, about 200 Croatian fans took the preparation for the national team, Livorno, Italy, while many of the Nazi seized a huge crowd in many.
As a result, the FIFA, the world football organiser, has accused Croatia of dealing with the reputation of the vote.
This was not the first.
In the Euro 2004 matches in Portugal, the Croatian team was sparked by the fans of the Croatian team.

George Maior was named the new head of the internal intelligence service after a parliamentary vote on Friday (October 6th).
A representative of the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD), the opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD), was headed by the Supreme Defence Committee.
Maior, who is student at George Washington University, said at the ceremony that he would be "the idea of political discrimination".
At the same time, Claudio Saftoiu, a close colleague of former journalist and President Traian Basescu, was convinced as the head of the Romanian foreign intelligence agency.
The decision by Basescu to discuss the new heads of the Intelligence Services to the opposition scene.
Though many were simply profitable, Maior was strongly opposed to the appointment.
He is testing the rhetoric of the ruling Liberal Democratic Alliance.
Prime Minister Colin Papescu Tariceanu 'Liberals consider the president' move.
The party signed forces with the ultranationalist Greek-Romania Party in opposing Maior.
Civil organisations are surprised.
"In Prensic, one of the secret services can join the decision to appoint one of the opposition.
However, the PSD issued a statement saying that the transition period of transition has been under control of these services, but not the political will needed for reform. "
Furthermore, the PSD has also been divided.
The reformist that Maior is owned by Maior has won the "Cluj factory" decision.
The former Socialist leaders, however, are complaining that the PSD has exploded a factor in the political war with Tariceanu.
The Maior election is proof that the president does not want to use secret services to political purposes, Basescu 'assistance say.
The current decision will be accepted a day of return to Romanian politics, officials said, adding that it could also launch a probe that one of the secret services could lead to opposition.
Basescu also says the decision serves a greater goal of supporting young people who are not linked to the Communist system.
"The president seems to see Maior as a couple of couple," Balkan analyst Tom Gallagher said in a wake in the daily Romania libera.
"It is clear that the pro-Western referendum has a disaster of relations with Romania, and the defence minister in Washington, which is currently disastrous for Romania, will have more confidence than Teodor Atanasiu."
He added that Basescu is in support of the Liberals' continued efforts to make itself effective.

The new Macedonian government has been short of allegations that the monopoly is poor to foreign aid.
The allegations made last week by government spokesman Veton Ibrahim were strongly discovered by former Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska, who is responsible for European Integration.
According to Ibrahi, some ambassadors complained that Sekerinska was used by foreign aid under the administration.
A government commission on the issue will be formed and the police, the finance ministry and the fight against corruption commission will also be involved, he said.
Sekerinska responded, saying the proceedings were proud of immunity charges without research.
The former minister accused the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party of failing to monitor him and to intervene the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia, ahead of a party vote on former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski.
Sekerinska is viewed as the most serious candidate that could be postponed after Buckovski, who lost a confidence vote on Saturday (October 7th).
Analysts say Sekerinska has the potential to increase the party in the worst period of history now.
International officials and diplomats have been boycotting their networks, saying the poor administration claims are impossible.
US Ambassador to Macedonia Gillian Milovanovic, British Ambassador Robert Chatterton Dickson and EU Special Representative Erwan Fouere all opposed Ibrahim.
"It was surprised that the previous US government was surprised by the media that accused the US government of using donors, including assistance through USAID.
The Embassy has said that there is no news from the abuse of abuse and there was no allegations in this direction. "
"All the goals of the USAID are in accordance with the American government, which enables these actions to fair, transparency and competitiveness.
Before the approval of any project, the practice partners have been balanced for internal control and disadvantage policies and procedures.
All financial losses and the project activities have been subject to retail and developing intellectuals imposed by independent firms, "Fouere said, noting that the procedures used are satisfied with the procedures.
"The management of EU aid is fully transparent, and we are satisfied with the results of the European Agency for Reconstruction," Fouere said.
Benzer also came from the British ambassador.
"We continue to work with the government in the same way with the current government, with a lack of irregularities or a comprehensive programme of our funds," Dickson said.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday (May 14th) that Serbia is ready to continue talks with Brussels if the new government is taking steps towards full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and continue economic reforms.
"We can revive the EU perspective," Rehn said at the session of the EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels.

The Democratic Party (DP), led by President Boris Tadic, was not part of the Democratic Party (DP), but instead of the government, was based on parliament support from former leader Slobodan Milosevic 'Socialists.
However, the new DSS-DPS-DPG17 government has a total of 130 seats in parliament, which will be able to implement reforms needed to move forward on the path to EU membership.
"We believe that this government will start working on the necessary reforms, not only an effective threat to the future, but also on the future," German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in Brussels on Monday.
Steinmeier reiterated that the EU was in early this year and reiterated that Serbia must meet its doors if the bloc fulfil its full co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal, including the arrest and extradition of indictees.
The Union suspended talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Belgrade in May 2006, following Serbian authorities' failure to arrest former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic and extradite to The Hague.
Under a coalition agreement, Tadic promised to take steps to boost relations with the tribunal, adding that his country will head the National Security Council, a new commission that will co-ordinate all security and intelligence services.
His party also control military service, while the DSS will retain tensions of the police force.
Tadic and Kostunica also agreed that Serbia will bring a key role in relations with The Hague tribunal, the intelligence agency BIA, who played a key role in relations with The Hague tribunal.
"I am confident that the leaders of the democratic forces in Serbia are now aware of their responsibilities and do not choose a European future for Serbia to allow the country to withdraw its nationalist past," Rehn said a day after his resignation of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party leader Tomislav Nikolic.
According to reports, Rehn 'visit to Belgrade, expected on Wednesday, the visa facilitation agreement between Serbia and the EU will be signed by the same date in Brussels, when it is scheduled to take place last week.

A key problem affecting the Balkans, which has affected energy to meet the request, and regional leaders agreed on a joint strategy to deal with it.
In Ohrid last month, leaders of the seven Southeast European (SEE) countries' (SEE) countries have drafted a plan to overcome the energy situation and end heavy electricity cuts, and said they need about 30 billion euros to implement it.
The presidents of Albania, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, as well as the Bulgarian president and the tripartite presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, attended the meeting.
They agreed that modernisation of the existing facilities and the construction of them is an important step.
In a statement issued at the end of the summit, natural gas must be made because the region currently imports 80% of its oil.
Macedonian President Branko Crvenkovski said his country is willing to participate in the construction of a new energy source in another country, instead of the two units closed to the Kozloduy nuclear plant in Bulgaria.
Crvenkovski cited the way for better use of water potential, improving oil and natural gas pipeline and electricity transportation systems and improving the needs of the thermal power plant in Bitola, Macedonia.
Bulgarian Deputy President Ando Marin said the energy supply in the region has become more complex after the closure of the units in Kozloduy.
Serbian President Tadic, meanwhile, urged Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary to build three right gas pipelines, respectively.
Tadic also announced that a major gas deposit in Vojvodina would be built.
"We will create an opportunity for more foreign investments by ensuring the minimum resources and improving regional co-operation," Croatian President Stipe Mesic said.
He added that his country hopes to become the Balkans' energy network.
"Croatia and the Pan-European Petroleum Exchange has been a long way in its work on energy problems with both Italy and Italy," he said.
Despite the Energy strategy agreement, the Ohrid meeting was imposed by the Kosovo status issue.
Speaking at a press conference between Serbian leader Tadic and Albanian President Alfred Moisiu, Moisiu accused Belgrade of trying to postpone a solution, but Tadic responded that Serbia has its own sovereignty.
Other leaders agreed that the problem is a major obstacle in developing relations.
"It is good for co-operation with all countries in the region, and the region is only the pace of the process of determination of Kosovo status," Mesic said.
Croatia Refugees Refugee Discussions
The transformation of refugees from the former Yugoslavia due to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia is the most appropriate issue.
Croatian President Stipe Mesic says a three-unilateral agreement would benefit.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 22 / 05 / 03
Croatian President Stipe Mesic, who wants to accelerate the return process, has proposed a three unilateral agreement that would be supported by politicians in Croatia, Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina 'highest level.
The document will also be a clear political signal to EU and NATO officials, who stressed that if the signing is signed, not only one of the most important problems that must return to the former cities, but also one of the most important problems the return to the region must be resolved.
Following more than eight years after the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, governments in the conflict are still trying to encourage refugees to return.
However, there are problems: some however, however, have been discovered, some of them are closed.
Following the delay, foreign governments are trying to speed up the process and work on the benefits of restructuring, restructuring, refugee returns, and the benefits of reconciliation.
However, the countries in the region have begun to weaken foreign aid, with preparations for their own plans to return.
Although Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia-Montenegro have repeatedly insisted that the return of refugees in Brussels is an important issue that the return process should be completed, the political service in Brussels said.
So far, the results have been encouraging, but the geography is not concrete.
Some refugees do not want to return to former places because they have established new life in other areas.
Those who are willing to return, have the opportunity to restore their lives and regain their goods.
Mesic, who also decided to convince the leadership and convince others to convince their clear messages and convinced that initiative was positive.
Since the democracy passed, countries in the region have entered closer co-operation.
However, new steps for stability and constant peace must be taken.
Mesic, who believes the time has come to close the flights of the discrimination issue, has asked international support.
After the end of the talks, the three unilateral agreement will be signed at a high-level meeting.
According to Mesic, the agreement should be based on common principles and values, and concrete measures should be taken after clear results.

With a new indictment against politicians and former LA member Fatmir Limaj on war crimes, it was said that this would have a potential impact on Kosovo politics and the potential impact on Prime Minister Hashim Thaci ’ s Democratic Party of Kosovo.
EULEX confirmed the indictment against Limaj and nine others last week.
They have been charged with torture and murder of prisoners in the village of Kirka in 1999.
The case has been waiting for months due to Limaj &aposs parliamentary immunity and the political debate on how to address the problem.
According to Political commentator Nikolist Sadiku, a negative court that would have a negative impact on Thaci in the presidential elections next year.
"The party is still at large, despite differences.
However, if Limaj entered in prison, the PDK will be responsible for Indine Thaci as one of the main members of the PDK, and the party will be removed from the party, "Sadiku said." Therefore, Thaci is trying to convince other political parties to postpone the presidential elections by 2013. "

Balkan countries are trying to overcome weapons and ammunition
The Balkans continue to be a lot of weapons in many homes, despite efforts to disarm the public.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 05 / 09 / 11
"If the weapons level is high, the public will be good as the security paramilitaries," said Cavit Sala, the Albanian interior ministry official. [Reuters]
Statistics in the region are surprise, and the consequences may be death.
In Albania, for example, analyst Jonz Kola is estimated that 6% and 9% of the population are weapons this summer. On July 18th, there are cases such as the murder of a 11-year-old children in Shkodra, 11.
"Ev is organised crime," said Albanian Interior Ministry official Cavit Sala, noting that the significant amount of weapons in 1997 has increased by civilians. "
The South East and Eastern Europe Small Arms and the Haff Armed Takas Centre (SEESAC) is a priority for efforts to improve national and regional capacity to control small and smaller weapons and use of weapons and reduction.
"Construction is still seen as an important task that the governments of the region have not been fully managed," Iva Savic, a professor of the SEESAC Bureau in Belgrade, told SETimes.
Saviic acknowledges that the SEESAC has no confidence and comprehensive database on the number of illegal weapons in various countries.
But in a survey by SEESAC in 2007, the SEESAC concluded that "in the Western Balkans, which has a population of 19.6 million people, civilians have almost 40m weapons."
In Kosovo, the daily Koha Ditore has been taken from a UNDP survey.
The survey found that 400,000 weapons in citizens are illegal.
"It is not only the people who have free access to archaeologists, but also plays a role in the social and material material of children.
The use of weapons is "boosting the level of criminal enlargement among young people" and gives them a conservative way.
Those who have witnessed violence live in the "post-traffic zone", he added.
Prosecutor says the regional governments have a clear determination to deal with the problem of illegal weapons.
The Croatian interior ministry says the Croatian internal affairs ministry has launched an arms and weapons campaign under the slogical "Az Armed, Az Trajel".
Such programmes "will help change the existing weapons in the region, encouraging the volunteers' voluntary isolation of illegal weapons, and that in the future," Savic said.
The Croatian government has made it clear that the Croatian government has achieved 58,000 small weapons and explosives, almost two million ammunition and about 2m tonnes of explosive explosions since 2007.
He told SETimes that a similar campaign would begin in Serbia within the months.
In addition, both Serbia and Croatia, the ongoing Small Armed Armed and Caff Armed (SALW) campaign are under way.
SEESAC and EU aid, the Serbian interior ministry was destroyed by 28,285 in 2010, about 27,000 needs and conservative weapons in 2009.
The Croatian interior ministry launched its campaign this year.
"So far, 30,000 weapons have been removed, while 7,000 were made," he said.
To avoid the continuation of the armed, some governments in the region are taking additional measures to guarantee their own police stations through improving infrastructure.
SEESAC is currently helping the governments of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to boost security in the SALW police stations.
In May, for instance, Montenegro was completed with the aid of the reconstruction of the "Taras" ammunition "architecture, SEESAC and the EU.
Another option should be taken, he said. "In the post-conflict region, the implementation of the current laws in illegal weapons cases of illegal weapons will be significant to efforts to keep illegal weapons," he said.

Only hours after the UN report on the movie, which took to Gaza last year released on Friday (September 2nd), Turkey announced that Israeli ambassador to Ankara would expand all military agreements with the former allies.
Salih Kapusz, deputy head of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) for relations with the public, said relations between the two countries are "bad than the Mavi Marmara incident".
"Our position has been documented since the beginning of us.
"If the results are, we have to go to the paper," Kapusz said. "If there is no compromise, it can be a world that could not be mutual."
In May 31st 2010, nine Turkish activist were killed after Israeli commanders face humanitarian aid, Mavi Marmara.
The UN report, drafted on Friday, revealed that the action was imposed by international law, but Israel has used extremist power.
Ankara requested official autonomy and victims' families, but Israel has not accepted it so far.
"Israel is regret of all losses and injured during the incident," said Arthur Lenk, the head of the Israeli foreign ministry 'International Law Office and a member of the UN commission.
He said his country "accepts the Commission report and hopes Turkey will work together with the reconstruction and enhance mutual relations for both countries".
"Our relations with Turkey have been very important for Israel," Lenk said. "In accordance with Israel, both countries have made significant efforts to reach a bilateral agreement that would allow it to stay and improve their relations."
"We hope that such a compromise will be reached in such a spirit," he added.
Former Israeli ambassador to Turkey, Alon Liel, said the main issue in Israeli relations has been "autonomy or language" in the past six months.
"Israel has decided to be free for more than a year ago, and now Turkey has to take part in the second phase of the second diplomatic climate in the Israeli diplomat, which is the lowest diplomatic friendship in the Israeli diplomat.
"We are damaging and inevitable," he added.
"It is uncertainly unfortunately that [Gaza] incident] is a dangerous level."
"There is no problems between our countries in the history.
Now, both Israel, and Turkey are wrong.
The diplomatic couple and time.

Iran, Brezilia and Turkey agreed on Monday (May 17th) to send many of the lowest rich campaign, under an agreement signed in Tahran.
The move, however, was sparked by officials from the EU and Russia, because Iran said it would stop 20% of the UN Security Council decisions, saying it would replace the 20% tensions programme.
Under an agreement signed by the foreign ministers of the three countries' foreign ministers on Monday, Iran will send a part of its low-engineering campaign to Turkey within a month.
In addition, 120kg nuclear fuel from a different foreign sources from a different foreign researcher to be used for medical research research.
Takas came after talks on a controversial nuclear programme between Iranian President Ahmoud Ahinejad, Brezilan counterpart Luxio Lula Silva and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
On Monday, the agreement focused on an agreement, signed last year by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mediator, and is based on a deal that Iran will send about 80% of the lowest removal campaign.
Tahran acknowledged the proposed agreement in October, but later warns that the UN could face new sanctions.
Iran is believed to be increased to about 2300kg today, from 1,500kg last autumn.
David College of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, said the country &aposs current stake is two times needed to produce enough materials for a bombing.
The move by Tahran to increase its bid to revive four months ago has sparked more concern among Western forces, who are worried about Iran 'real targets of the nuclear programme.
"For us, there is no new sanctions or measures for measures," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told reporters in Tahran. "We hope that Iran IAEA will give a letter to a letter and we hope that the IAEA will give a positive response in Vienna as soon as possible."
Western officials, however, have made it clear that the new agreement is not going to work on new UN sanctions against Iran, saying the new agreement does not go to.
A spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, Maja Kocijancic, said Monday that the agreement, which the IAEA was mediated last year, seems to "change".
"If Iran accepted the IAEA proposal, this is good news, the international community cannot solve the fundamental challenge that Iran is serious concerns about the peaceful peace programme," DPA quoted Kocijancic as saying.
"The reason that we are still continuing the Security Council decision, the reason that Iran is not serious and does not comply with the decisions that do not provide confidence on the programme," he said.
While Turkey and Brezilia, a two non-permanent members of the Security Council, Turkey and Brezilia have been on the efforts of the agreement, "impressive" agreement should now be communicated to the IAEA, "clear and efficient".
"The United States and the international community are continuing serious concerns, when Iran does not stop remarks, and the need for resolving fundamental problems related to the nuclear programme," White House Press Secretary Robert Ghebs said.

The international community said it is planning to launch talks on the final status of Kosovo, if the province has made significant progress in meeting the criteria set in areas such as the rule of law, minority rights and dialogue with Belgrade in mid-2005.
In a speech Wednesday, the head of the OSCE Mission in Kosovo and CEC President Jacques Modvig called on the "new government to establish efforts and continue to continue to implement the standards that the international community has made a major house".
Some have expressed concern that talks on the government are entering a possible stalemate and the parties are repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeated the agreement in 2001.
The observers say Rugova will seek a joint search among the main pro-independent Kosovo Albanian parties and the talks will lead to a few important changes in the current government.
While acknowledging the possibility of a certain delay, a Western diplomat has acknowledged that this time would be short.
"They are not the same weeks, but will take a few weeks.
However, it is not much weeks, "he said.
Local newspapers predict that UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen could intervene if no agreement was reached within 10 days.

British Major General David Leakey, commander of the EU peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), held the first press conference in Sarajevo on Wednesday (November 3rd).
According to Leakey, the new force will continue its mandate and capabilities of the current power force that depends on NATO.
"The SFOR will be a beautiful transit to EUFOR and we will further increase SFOR ’ s success," Leakey said. "EUFOR will have a number of soldiers and will have the same authority of Dayton.
The transition from SFOR to EUFOR means that 80 per cent of SFOR soldiers have changed only architect and changing EU rates, "SFOR said.
The transition will take place on December 2nd, when the EU began its military operation in BiH, Althea.
This operation will replace the NATO operation in charge of implementing military aspects of the 1996 Dayton Mediterranean Treaty, prevention of other reductions and stability in the country.
EUFOR will have the same legal mandate under the Dayton Agreement.
According to Leakey, the main tasks of EUFOR will be to protect peace and stability in BiH, helping the country 'ongoing defence reform and co-operate with NATO headquarters in BiH and arrest war crimes indictees.
However, Leakey stressed that the country is the biggest responsibility to fulfil its obligations against the UN war crimes tribunal is BiH officials.

Macedonian citizens will decide on Sunday (November 7th) between the former 1996 law, in a referendum on the new territorial arrangement.
The new law, which will reorganise the current 123 municipalities instead of 83 municipalities, aims to implement one of the obligations the country has made under the Ohrid Framework Agreement.
According to international officials, the referendum will also create an effective effect on Macedonia &aposs final bid to join NATO and the EU.
"Local governance is one of the robbery of the Ohrid Agreement and is a basic element that will allow the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to join Euro-Atlantic structures," NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General Alessandana Minuto Rizzo said last week.
In a statement Monday, the EU said Macedonia respects the right to organise a referendum under the constitution, but warned that a delay in local administration would "jeopardise the progress towards the EU".
The main opposition VMRO-DPMNE, which opposes the new law with other parties, argues that the law would lead to divisions, federation of the country and secularism among ethnic groups.
"It is the way to become a state," VMRO-DPMNE leader Nikola Gruevski said. "We have historic responsibility to protect the independence of the state."
Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Sekerinska, who is responsible for European integration, said that the country would lead to Macedonia to a institutional and political crisis, which would lead to delay in meeting political criteria set by the EU.
According to Sekerinska, Macedonia will remain at least a year in implementing local governance or responsibilities to municipalities.
According to the constitution, the results of a referendum have been changed for a minimum year.
The law requires at least 855,000 voters to be successful to the referendum.
The ruling coalition called on the public to stay in their homes, as the voting does not apply to the minimum participation in the minimum turnout.

Observers say one of the two proposed anti-corruption measures is unconstitutional.

The Serbian Tax Administration has recently presented a proposal to increase the risk for all who think about bribery or other kind of corruption.
The measure will include a "stake" -- one of the most convicted of corruption -- one of which is convicted.
"The state is ready to oppose corruption, and I claim that those who think they are doing corruption will leave the beginning," Tax Executive Director Dragutin Radosavljevic told the state television RTS.
In addition to the arbitration of the unit, the proposal is calling for the presence of the provisions.
While acknowledging the fight against corruption should be accelerated, many lawmakers and NGOs argue that the constitution is unilateral.
They say the existing laws will be more successful if it is implemented, corruption will be more successful.
"There is a constitution," Zlatko Minic, a member of the Anti-Corruption Agency, told SETimes. "All a career is not possible to connect one of the convicted conviction."
"The greatest Constitutional Court will probably be taken by the Constitutional Court," he added.
They claim that the fight against corruption is more efficient.
"Authorities should encourage and protect those who announced corruption, as well as to protect them that we are working in the public service, we should focus on more assurances and prove that their salaries are not enough," International Transparency International Serbia representative Nemanja Nenadic told SETimes.
Radosavljevic, however, argues that more competitiveness measures are necessary.
"One institution can harm the reputation of the sector and the government, and has a negative impact on the image of the state," he said.
Experts say the part of the Tax Administration proposal is located to the presence of the property.
"Such a measure is implemented against organised crime and war crimes provisions in Serbia, and they have to prove that they have to find the money to prevent them to prevent their property assets," he said.
However, he said, the Tax Administration has the legal vehicles that people can control their assets.
"In 2002, the law on the tax administration and taxation process has allowed to meet between prominent revenues and expenditures and expenditures," Minic said. "The Tax Administration will be tended to see that mechanisms without the proposed measure.
In addition, persons who have a clear corruption suspicion of judges could be prosecuted and abuse money from at least, but there is no evidence, "he said.
Corruption is considered a key precondition for EU membership.
Last year, a Global Corruption Barometer said Serbian citizens have increased corruption over the past three years.
At the same time, the government has dropped from 2.38 to 2.24, while the cabinet announced plans for a new strategy.

The movie, directed by Bosnia and Herzegovina director Pjer Zalica, won one of the five awards this year at the Sarajevo Film Festival, which has been working for film producers in the region.

"I expect the movies to take an equal response," said Adeir Kenovic, the three long-standing traffic films in BiH last year.
"It is clear that these achievements do not exist.
The young people who have short movies will have more chance to do long traffic film, "he said.
Gori (Fuljer), the first long traffic film of Pjer Zalica, won a total of five awards -- two best regional film.
The festival has made ten films from six countries -- the regional programme of this year -- sparked concerns at the National Sinema Sale, which was closed to the demonstrations at the local cinema.
Though BiH structures were less short programme, regional movies will benefit local optimiss.
This year, however, was inaugurated this road.
Apart from the movie by Zalica, the festival was held under the BiH programme, Srdjan Vuletic 'Ljeto Vuletic (Golden') world movie (Golden '), and the movie was shot by Antono Mustafic' Remather (Reconstruction).
In one year, three films have been held in three films, only a country that has only three films from 1992 to 2001.
However, BiH born director Denis Tanovic has repeatedly revealed that local movie producers have not been imposed by local film producers, since No Man 'Land (Agriculture Regional District) won the Oscar award in 2002.
The government formed a movie fund for financing the movies of Zalica and Vuletic.
The money is a joint issue of all regional directors.
Bulgarian director Ludmil Torodov said his country now has two or three films annually, but the figure is over 20 years in the Communist regime.
"There is no foreign money in this film," Todorov said, for the regional programme, financed by the National Film Centre and the state television.
"It is easy, but it is very slow," he added.
Apart from the Regional programme, the festival was the highest level of overall accession.
Pasolar was sold a hour after the sale on the internet, while the festival has created more than 1,000 people in front of the workers, which opened before a week.
In all, 162 films participated in 44 countries followed more than 100,000.
The media, such as Gori Djurra, who met last week after Pjer Zalica returned to the film festival in Switzerland, was the first round of award.
"We do not do to get the movie for the award.
However, there is no film without them.
This would be good, if the movie can increase the rise of the money that is invested, "he said.

In Turkey, which has passed four military coups over the past 50 years, the military is completely independent from the army, and the army was approved only by politicians.
This year, however, Erdogan refused to ratify General Hasan Ilymic, who elected the military 'commander, as the officer refused to tackle the government in an investigation into a combined convention on internet propaganda.
According to some observers, the convicted at the summit was a victory for civil democracy during the week.
However, critics of the ruling Justice and Development Party say the government has implemented six places in order to weaken the way of an Islamic dictator.
"There are two swimming facts," Jusuf Canada, a political commentator in the secularist opposition stations, told SETimes. "In the first time, I am not a civilian government, I am not a big step in the Turkish democracy because I will decide and decide this decision."
"However, they are here to strengthen their own.
The government does not do so to contribute to Turkish democracy, but it is doing to stop people who do not want to appoint key positions. "
The so-called Internet propaganda is one of the 18 high-ranking officers who were called to tackle the conspiracy.
Chief of the current staff forces, General Ion Kohaner, was prepared to meet the extradition of General Staff Lieutenant General Staff, who will be retired on August 30th.
However, the appointment of Kohaner was stopped, due to the failure of an unstalled stalemate.
Among the list of terrorism, 11 other officers who were arrested in 2003 on judges on a compromise conspiracy, aimed at transferring the Islamic trust government.
The coup plan was revealed by the Agrian newspaper in February and allegedly convinced that the military couple was destroyed by the Agrian newspaper and the military tensions between Greece and Greece are also under way to create a climate.
Last month, 102 officers have been arrested on the plan, claiming that the army was part of a military training seminar aimed at removing a internal unrest.
"All these issues are criminals, but the government is also used to simple the issue," he said.
In this country, we need to have the military dictator.
However, the civilian dictator, which is dangerous, is a discourse, "he said.
"This is a step forward towards democracy, but the problem is to be seen by some parts that have recognised the government as a traditional protection of the interests of the society," said Mustafa Mediterranean, liberal Islamist comments at the Star daily.
"It is time to politics without the army.
Turkey is not a dictator.
The opposition media and opposition parties have the opposition.
There is no role of the military. "

Turkish Military Commander: the country Says to Reconstruction of Iraq
The head of the Turkish military, the chief of the General Staff, cautioned that Ankara 'decision to send troops to Iraq was sentenced to Turkey to the political restructuring of its neighbour.
(The New York Times - 10 / 11 / 03; Reuters, AFP - 09 / 11 / 03; BBC, Reuters, FT, VOA, Anadolu Agency - 07 / 11 / 03)
Turkish Army Chief of Staff cautioned that Ankara 'decision to send troops to Iraq has left the country from its right to the future political inclusion of its southern neighbour.
"We do not know that Iraq will be the last time.
He came after the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced on Friday that Ankara has decided to send troops to Iraq for now.
The decision was made in a telephone conversation between Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul and US Secretary of State Colin Powell on Thursday, the statement said.
The Turkish government was approved by parliament in early October, when it was forced to provide troops to the US peacekeeping force in Iraq, but it was approved by the Iraqi government and the Iraqi Kurdistan Kurds.
The Turkish public also opposed plans to send the military.
"We have made very willingness to send troops since the beginning," the BBC quoted Gul as saying on Friday. "We have said we would send troops [if we] benefit, we will only be beneficial."
However, we did not see the situation.
It is the reason for us to decide. "
Voicing regret over Washington &aposs regret for the amendments to the plan, Foreign Minister Richard Boucher said on Friday that the minimum clients are stable to stability Iraq.
"I am the existence that both the United States and the Turks and the Iraqi entities will not serve as a goal that we are now," Boucher said in a speech.

He repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly said his country would follow its developments, when it comes to instability in Iraq would affect Turkey.
Turkey has expressed concern that the Kurdish Kurds in northern Iraq would revive the ethnic Kurds living in southeastern Turkey, reviving their separatist legitimacy.
"Terrorism activities have been translated.
Iraq becomes a terror network. "
If Iraq is divided and a formation in the north, this will affect us very deeply. "
At the same time, 1,500 Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq have removed the possibility of withdrawing.
"Our forces in the army are showing our determination, and this is an indication that the region has affected us," he said. "We will continue to stay in the army if we have to change it," he said.
Bulgaria "disappointed" from losing EU funds
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to stop Bulgaria ’ s access to EU funds, citing Sofia fails to deal with corruption and organised crime.
(Euobserver, EurActiv, FT, Times - 26 / 11 / 08; AFP, Reuters, AP, DPA, BBC, International Herald Tribune, Euobserver, BNT, Sofia Echo, Dnevnik, Mediapool, News.bg, Focus news agency - 25 / 11 / 08)
"We must play and comply with financial governance rules," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [File]
The European Commission (EC) took an unprecedented step against a EU member country on Tuesday (November 25th), calling the country to spend a 220m-euro fund, citing Bulgaria &aposs failure to take any beginning of organised crime and corruption.
The commission also warned Sofia that if it does not take action, 340m euros will lose more than 340m euros.
In July, the EC frozen about 500m euros in aid to the country, citing weaknesses and fraud cases of control systems in Bulgaria, in a report released.
The organisation also withdrew the reputation of two state agencies in charge of the funds under the pre-accession PHARE programme -- one of the finance ministry -- as well as under the regional development ministry.
The EU has suspended more than 800m euros to the country since Bulgaria joined the bloc in January 2007.
Of this, 560m euros came from the PHARE programme, including 220m euros, a contract that has now been registered.
If the EC does not decide to resume two practice agencies before 2009, Sofia should be the remaining contract, but it could lose 340m euros.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn told reporters on Tuesday that the EC is still unable to do so, due to the recent revised report in July, as well as new irregularities, in line with the report.
"Of course, we need to do everything," Rehn said in Brussels. "We must play and comply with financial governance rules."
Following the EC decision on Tuesday, commission spokesman Krisztina Nagy urged Bulgaria to move forward to improve the management of EU funds.
According to the EC, the reforms Bulgaria has entered this year did not provide an extraordinary improvement in the management of EU funds.
"I know that the action plans are prepared and I know that the legislation is reviewed, but most of these measures have been revised, they have no concrete results," Rehn said.
On Tuesday, the decision was released by Bulgarian officials.
Both of the Berlin, Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev and deputy head of EU funds, Meglena Plugchieva, criticised the EC and expressed "disappointment".
Stanishev complained that the EU has not been beyond Bulgaria as it is doing to other member states.
Despite that, Plugchieva said Bulgaria would "implement the rules and procedures of Europe to guarantee all European funds in a right and transparent manner".

A new monitoring mechanism was launched on June 30th, after the EU Council decided on Croatia to close its accession talks and open its path to accession talks by the end of the year -- to ensure that Croatia must fulfil its commitments.
The commission is seeking to repeat the situation on Bulgaria and Romania, which took place its preparations for full membership responsibility, while continuing to continue serious problems with crime and corruption, which entered the EU in 2007.
"The monitoring of reform efforts by the end of the process will allow Croatia and the current member states to ensure confidence," the EU leaders said in a report on June 24th.
Croatia will be the first EU candidate country to implement the new monitoring system, which will continue until July 1st 2014, when it is expected to continue.
"Croatia has made great progress, but the courts must continue to work on ensuring the prevention and the implementation of the legal system," EC Vice-President and Adalane Reding said in an interview with Deutsche Welle.
The comments in the Justice and Temel Rights, including intellectual and efficiency of Judiciary reform and efficiency, will be published in the progress reports of a six-month Council.
The commission will warn Croatian authorities in early warnings if the requirements remain at large.
This mechanism will allow the EU to implement "stable pressure" during the past year between the end of the negotiations.
Several EU governments, including France, Britain and the Netherlands, argue that Croatia has supervised the process.
The EU is open to a good textile from Romania and Bulgaria, when it began participation in the tender.
David Florian Bieber, a professor at the University of Southeast Europe, says the new monitoring mechanism is another reason.
"The negotiations of Croatia have been completed very quickly, so some of the commitments must be met, especially in the fight against corruption and the rule of law," Bieber told SETimes.
Croatian state officials see optimistic and new mechanism as an encourage to continue reforms.
"The overall chapters in the closing chapters of Croatia have confirmed that the country is determined to meet all its commitments, fulfil various obstacles on its path to membership, and not a safe EU member," a spokesperson of the Croatian Foreign and European Integration Ministry told SETimes. "This is a strong stance in the past years."
"This new mechanism is good," Bieber said. "This new mechanism has shown that completing the EU membership talks can think new and constructive ways and that it is still in the methods of monitoring progress."
With a broad EU enlargement perspective, the new monitoring mechanism in Croatia is also an example of talks with other countries in the Balkans.

"A statement by Say Obama on Sunday (April 24th) shows a unilateral and historic perspective," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Sunday (April 24th). [Reuters]
Speaking at the weekend, US President Barack Obama described the death of 91.5 million Armenians ago as "one of the biggest complaints in the 20th century", but did not use genocide.
"In 1915, I have repeatedly expressed the opinion of the incidents and did not change this issue.
"The fact that the expenses are uncertain, sincerely and fair, all of us have the interests of us," he said.
In Turkey, Obama responded, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the statement was "a unilateral and historic perspective".
"The issue of this issue is on the agenda every year, and the reduction of our relations with the United States," the Istanbul daily Hurriyet quoted Davutoglu as saying.
"We expect Obama to understand that Turks live at the time," said Say Obama.
In the incidents, many history described as the first genocide of the 20th century, 1.5 million Armenians were killed in 1915-1916.
However, Ankara has rejected the allegations, however, suggests that the figures have been exaggerated and death in a broad civil war, and that Turks were killed in the same process.
Today, there was no one for years to controversy in Turkey on the issue that protects the assassination of the assassination.
The situation, however, has already begun to change.
The smaller ceremony in the country on Sunday (April 24th) was named by Armenian intellectuals and medical leaders who were arrested by Ottoman officials in Istanbul.
Most of the detainees were suspended to Central Anatolia and died their life.
Turkey has been insisting that the Armenians have not been a plan for the systematic formation of Armenians for years, but many say it was the beginning of a greater cleansing operation.
Obama praised Ankara and Erivan for their efforts to improve bilateral relations in recent years, and asked the two countries to continue to move forward on this path.
"I am convinced with the Turkish Cypriots who rescue Armenians in 1915, and I think that the dialogue between Turks and Armenians and Turkish people is proud to be produced.
Turkish and Armenians will strengthen their common history and common people, "he said.
Following some traffic incidents in Turkey, Armenians from their contributions to the world have contributed to around around the world, Obama said these contributions are "a demonstration of the force of Armenians, minimum and encouraging".
The head of the US Armenian division in the United States was unable to announce the post, and the president accused Armenian genocide ahead of the elections that he would recognise Armenian genocide.
"More than 1.5 million men, women and children were not able to leave the murder of a number of female atrocities and abuse, and the Turkish government has not been removed to parliament, because it is not open," the US Armenian Assembly said in a statement.
Turkish group plans to send new aid mission to Gaza
The Turkish-Israeli relations, which is tense, could face a new problem.

The Turkish humanitarian aid group, which organised the controversial Gaza movie last year, plans to make a similar action next month.
Israel wants Ankara to block this new mission, government officials confirmed on April 14th.
The government, however, insists that it is not an obstacle to the road.
In the previous aid mission, eight Turkish and a Turkish repeated US citizens were lived in their life.
The IHH movie violated Israel 'crowd for Gaza, saying it was accomplished in line with international law.
Analysts say Turkey has also criticised Israeli policy for Palestinians earlier, but criticism from Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Development Party (AKP) came to power.
"The public in Turkey always was always interested in the citizens of the Palestinian people, but they were not taken into consideration the public policy.
Now the situation is different.
The AKP is very successful, "he said.
Turkey has been willing to play a mediator role among different groups in the Middle East and North Africa in recent years.
Earlier this month, the country proposed to host a meeting between the two rival groups in Palestinian and Hamas.
"Turkey is a special mission that has a strategic position between the Middle East and Europe in the past period, and it sees itself as a constructive and model for other countries in the region," he told SETimes.
Turkey, however, has met with Hamas, undermining the official mandate of Palestinian administration, according to Youfa University.
"The official Palestinian government of Turkey is important.
This is not a constructive approach to weakening the country ’ s official power, "he said.
Following the female crisis in Turkey last year, Israel has won a mistake.
A popular movie, a popular movie by the Prosecutor of the Prosecutors' Watch in January, was not revealed as Israeli monuments.
A fair co-operation between the two countries was among the two countries, with Turkey sent to Israel last December at the forests that ended at least 44 people in the Karmel Mountain, which ended the death of at least 44.
Despite several questions that must be resolved to improve the labour, some experts hope.
"The Turkish entity is not in line with the interests of Turkey and should regain its security," he said.
It is difficult to happen if the internal politics of Israel is increasingly registered and the Israeli government continues to harm the people of Gaza, "he said.
"We have to do everything, and we will find how to block the movements that can be able to sit in a rest, and to reflect the truth strategic interest in the region and politics.
In Turkey, Israel has many friends in Israel.
It will be the interest of both sides to find a solution. "
How has Nikolic 'effects of the strike?

Tomislav Nikolic began to repair and water after the church appealed.
Meanwhile, analysts are trying to account that Nikolic has created an effect on the political scene of Serbia.
The leader of the Serbian Progress Party (SNS) began a strike on April 16th, when the country wants to go to early elections.
After Patriarch Iriney intervened in the situation, Nikolic began restricting water on April 21st, after he said such protests were disappointed by the Serbian Orthodox.
Several days later, a strike on Sunday, when the Pasteria bought, was complete.
The government, which criticised Nikolic for a swift language, suggested it undermines the country 'stability and encouraged radical movements.
"One of the largest opposition party in the country should be a responsibility.
"This is to give a message to the citizens to ensure that any request can be fulfilled," he said.
"Unfortunately, all these are part of a political market plan, which is a dangerous example of the dangerous and unstable country to Serbia."
According to Belgrade economist Milan Kovacevic, a foreign investment adviser, Nikolic has more effective to the country. "One of the elements that pointed to the investment climate is political risk and instability.
"There is a lack of instability due to the strike, Serbia has weakened its opinion that Serbia is in accordance with investment."
SNS members reject criticism.
"Nikolic has damaged any other identification from jeopardising his own life?
During our actions, the country has not been jeopardised with the stability of the project.
"This government is threatening the European bid of Serbia," he said.
Political analyst Dejan Vuk Stankovic says Serbia has achieved the threat of radical unrest, but the tension between the government and the opposition is the basis of the greatest relationship.
"Although the citizens are satisfied with living standards, more radical protests are not ready.
This time, however, will be more deeply deeply deepening between the government and the opposition, "Stankovic said.
"Therefore, I do not think that the European integration process will lose, because the Serbian Progress Party wants Serbia to receive EU candidate status," he said.
The strike acknowledged that Nikolic had the potential for a rising direction of Serbian politics, analysts said. "President Boris Tadic was boycotted in the strike, and the early elections were a dangerous example.
However, Nikolic won in the elections and was prime minister, and what do you do you do if the workers are not satisfied with the bureau, or do you do not do the strike of more radical protests? "
According to SNS member Stefanovic, the party is ready to tackle these challenges: "We know that we will face many problems if the government is given a government mandate.
However, we can solve the government through dialogue, if all problems, the people and medicine workers do not want to speak with them. "
According to the current election team of Serbia, the general elections are scheduled for 2012.
The SNS, which has been highly supported by voters for months, could also win high votes in the early elections, according to public research.

Although most of the other issues are different, the major political forces in Kosovo have reached a consensus at least on a issue: the government is a move to address the control of two border crossings in the north last month.
The intervention in the north is supporting the country ’ s political architecture and support for the first time, said Radio Free Europe office head Arbana Vidic.
"I believe that this situation in the north is from the disappointment of the Kosovo political architecture [the international community] in charge of the 12 years of status," he told SETimes. "Now they see a big change for this situation."
Parliament highlighted broad support for the move, accepting a decision against 89 on July 28th, citing a decision to support the decision.
He came from Vetevendosje, where Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said he was not enough.
The move called on the president to declare an extraordinary state and stop talks with Serbia.
"All citizens and resources are the only way to unify and protect the territorial integrity of territorial integrity," said Glauk Konjufca, representing the party.
Konjufca also accused Prime Minister Hashim Thaci of "personal leaders", saying he wants to do everything.
The government was also supported by the University of Pristina.
Mentor Hasani, head of parliament, told SETimes that the security of Kosovo police is full and supports the intervention.
"This action was politics and citizens in the country, because the intervention was not imposed," Hasani told SETimes.
The NGO, meanwhile, launched a boycott campaign from Serbia.
Lavdrim Gashi, a member of the NGO, told SETimes that the public is trying to "provide aware of the differences that they can be moved without Serbian goods".
Some political comments, however, responded to the cautious response, saying the real results could be mixed.
"There is nothing from the UN meeting.
The Kosovo government was unfortunately, but did not prepare good and failed.
This will be a price for Kosovo, because a second initiative will be very difficult, "he said.
"The northern issue in the talks could be another preliminary and except from the Ahtisaari framework," Spahiu said. "There is no good state of cantons and entities, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina."
In response to the government movement, local Kosovo Serbs have blocked ways to reach one of the border crossings.
A police officer died the outbreak of the suicide attack.
The outcome of KFOR to take over border crossings ended.
Under an interim agreement, NATO peacekepers will continue to protect border crossings without a long-term solution.
Turkish National Assembly votes new president
The Turkish parliament began to elect the new president on Friday, while the main opposition party boycotted the vote and threatened to apply for the Constitutional Court.

"I cannot be a democratic and social state in the constitution, which is based on the constitution," Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said. [Getty Images]
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is trying to provide two majority for president Abdullah Gul, ahead of the first round of parliamentary vote on Friday (April 27th).
The AKP MP Erslemez Judge, who has a different opinion of the post of current Ahmet Necdet Sezer, is said to have no chance to renew Gul, which currently holds the foreign minister.
According to the constitution, at least 367 of the 550 deputies in parliament have to win a candidate in the first round.
The second round of votes will be held on Wednesday and a two-thirds majority will be needed.
If none of them do not support this level, the majority will be the third round of voting on May 9th, or 276 votes will be enough.
If this does not happen, Sezer will take the fourth and last round of voting on May 15th, a day before the end of the seven years of mandate ended.
The AKP, which has 353 seats, including the president of the parliament, appeared confident Thursday that Gul would win a victory in the first round of Friday, despite the main opposition Republican People (CHP) plans to boycott the vote.
"Everything is very clear," Parliament Speaker Bent Arinc told reporters. "This parliamentary parliament will elect the 11th president of Turkey."
CHP, who has a 152 lawmakers in parliament and wants the next president to be elected after the early parliamentary elections, warned that the results would be opposed at the Constitutional Court if less than 367 deputies participate in the parliamentary session on Friday.
However, the number of traditional member states will be enough to open the session of 184 lawmakers, he said.
Prosecutor experts have supported this opinion, saying the CHP has more than cancelled the election outcome.
AKP leader and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan invited all lawmakers to join the session Friday.
"I call on all elected lawmakers to come to parliament and fulfil democratic political tasks.
We live one of the most important days of democracy, "he said.
Opposition pressure reflects some concerns that the ruling AKP, which has the Islamic roots, will focus on all key state positions.
Although the AKP rejected it, the secularists fear the party has a secret agenda.
Gul, who wants to disperse these fears, has since been elected on Tuesday, has promised that if it was elected, the secularism principles will be elected and that all citizens will be president.
"I am unable to have a democratic and social state in the constitution," Gul said in an interview with the daily Milliyet on Thursday.
They also fear that the AKP will repeatedly repeat its efforts to remove the current headscarf ban after Gul was a major branch of veto authority.
The law envisions Turkish women from headscarves in universities and state agencies.
The wife of Gul, such as Erdogan and Arinc, is also on the wife of Hajzic.
Gul said this week that his wife was personal and should be respected.

The ongoing debate between Greece and Macedonia took place at the end of December.
This time, a new name in the Skopje airport -- Aleksandar Macedoniski (Macedonia) -- has sparked a announcement that he would be named.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis, accusing Skopje of historical monitoring, reiterated the threat to Macedonia &aposs EU integration process, which Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis has indicted two months ago.
"A long time after 2,000 years of history can be changed," Bakoyannis said. "This behaviour can be revealed and created the obligations of good neighbourly relations and their obligations to the EU.
They do not serve in Euro-Atlantic purposes.
Greece has made it clear that its concept and partners.
This is a stance that is supported by all politicians. "
The ancient cultural heritage of Macedonians, which has been sparked by the military, has been a substantial debate so far since the country declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992.
Among the controversial points, "Macedonia" was revealed in Greece, but it is still used in the official Macedonian flag, Vergina star and a "controversial presence" of the Macedonian minority in northern Greece.
The Macedonian city of Macedonia, in particular, showed the allegations of culture in the north of the region, and the Macedonian government is taking protests against their policies in the early 1990s.
The prime minister, who has a "Macedonia" on his own airport "in charge of the region and has been more complicated to criticism of the name of the Skopje airport.
"We want them to exercise good neighbourly relations, but we do not want to see historical reality," George Kahtzis said.
This type of movements is friendly and will not bring a solution to the problems in the country, he said.
Nevertheless last month, Athens responded to the concerns of the "Macedonian minority" in northern Greece, where the Macedonian government rejected the presence of Bakoyannis.
Special Representative Matthew Nimetz has proposed some solutions to the name issue of the former Yugoslav republic, known as the FYROM in the UN, but also rejected both sides.
However, Macedonia 'prospects for EU and NATO membership, while both sides may be able to pressure on the political capital to reach a compromise that can be acceptable to mutual reconciliation.

Serbia, which argues that opposing Kosovo independence and instead of "real autonomy", has warned that its borders would oppose any proposal that does not guarantee violation of their borders.
Local Government Minister Zoran Locar said Ahtisaari would "appeal to the Serbian government if it has signed an independence agreement with Albanian nationalists".
Serbian President Boris Tadic urged Ahtisaari at the weekend to postpone the new government in Belgrade after the establishment of the new government.
Tadic said a supervised proposal could jeopardise coalition talks in Serbia.
Kosovo will not be on the agenda of the Security Council this month, Russian Ambassador to the UN Security Council Vitaly Churkin said at a press conference last week.
"We believe that we should be given an opportunity to continue dialogue with the parties," he said. "The transformation of the standard will be very dangerous."
He also confirmed, however, that the Ahtisaari plan would be invested soon.
"There is a opinion that Ahtisaari will present the Kosovo proposal after the elections in Serbia," he said.

We will continue to improve institutions and bring European standards in order to accelerate our approach to European integration, "he said.
Nebojsa Radmanovic, a member of the BiH tripartite presidency, said his country would not block its decision to remove the visa regime.

The Macedonian Parliament made its history of the complex (public) on the new territorial arrangement laws (November 7th) as the vote of the country. [Tomislav Georgiev]
The Macedonian Parliament said on 7 November as a historic historic of the complex on the new territorial arrangement laws.
The decision came after a 180444 signature in support of the World Macedonian Congress, the organisation led by the complex request.
The materials gathered in the framework of a six-month damage between February 23rd and August 23rd.
Speaking to Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski, who opened the parliamentary session on the issue, said lawmakers should not discuss the complex, but not only the historical events.
The laws approved in recent months have fulfilled the remaining commitments under the Ohrid Peace Accords, which ended seven months of ethnic conflict in 2001.
The opposition VMRO-DPMNE party and the Liberal Democrats, said the historic initiative should be the history when they began the complex initiative.
"The World Macedonian Congress wants to be held on November 21st, so that Muslims should be accepted by Ramadan," the VMRO-DPMNE said in a statement.
According to Rafis Aliti, a member of the small coalition member of the Democratic Union for Integration, however, the most votes are to be held before the vote.
"As a party, the November 7th proposal is appropriate for us," Aliti said, noting that religious workers should not be involved.
Macedonian voters will be questioned in the vote, "the Republic of Macedonia, which was passed in 1996, approves the local governance board (municipalities and the Skopje Chamber of Company), which was defined by the College of the Charter and the Local governance Intellectuals (Skopje), which was defined in the same year?"
The law is a public vote, but the majority of voters are coming to the agenda, if the turnout is over 50 per cent.
The result is consensus and the state authorities must be done.
Despite the historic date of the local elections in Macedonia on November 21st, the complex will now be postponed.
Parliament voted on amendments to the local election law, decided that the local elections were held in the first weekend of March for four years.
However, the 2005 local elections will be held on March 31st.
Meanwhile, the EU has warned Macedonia that its chances for membership could be jeopardised if voters reject laws on territorial order.
Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said on Tuesday (September 14th) that the Union views the implementation of the Ohrid Agreement as "essential".
The EU also confirmed that the European Commission will be given to Skopje on 1 October, on the application of Macedonia &aposs candidate status.
With elections approach, debate over Kurdish problem
The ongoing competitiveness and capital political measures for the Kurdish votes have been pushing on the reputation of the June 12th elections.
By Anna Wood for Southeast European Times in Istanbul – 23 / 05 / 11
The conflict between security forces and PKK terrorists is on the rise, including a attack on Prime Minister Erdogan 'election consensus.
In the past two months, almost 50 people died in violence. [Reuters]
Turkey is also a political crisis in the Middle East, while Turkey, which has long been shown as an example of respect for Islamic and democracy.
With the general elections on June 12th, tensions between the state and the Kurdish community have always reached a dramatic level, with the threats of Kurdish candidates, arrest of students and threats from both sides.
The violence is growing. On 4 May, PKK terrorists attacked Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Erdogan was forced before the attack, but a member of the police was killed.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Electoral Council has decided to ban 12 independent candidates supported by the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), sparked protests in southeastern and other areas.
During the demonstrations, a Kurdish civilian lives.
"This increase in violence could be seen as a result of the ruling struggle," Hidoglu, an expert historical history on Kurdish nationalism, University of Florida Florida, told SETimes.
In addition to the public, the majority of the nominated candidates banned by withdrawal to parliament in June, withdrawing the verdict 'verdict.
This decision reflects the eastern of the Turkish politics and the judiciary, the first round of the Turkish political and judicial system.
Henri Barkey, a member of the Legium University and Carnegie International Health Organisation, described the initiative of law enforcement as "a last minute initiative for the government and the military to street the elections".
He pointed out that the establishment "would not be able to prevent people from the BDP" that it will not be able to join.
According to Professor, this is a positive signal for the difference of judges.
The National Strategic Studies Institute of Strategic Studies President Minerva Denmark highlighted the importance of the protests.
"Such incidents are" high "reactions, a number of positive consequences shows that the changes have been really taken," Natasa said.
Such incidents are a subject to the initiative, which the AKP launched two years ago on the Kurdish pharmaceutical phone, and the debates have turned into a "Kurdish Appeals" that would ensure unprecedented rights in this population.
In this direction, such as the establishment of a state television channel broadcast, which is still a key jest in a country where the use of the Kurdish language in public order in 90 years is still law.
However, the fundamental changes that many are hoping have not been done, and the relations were discovered after the incidents that were viewed as a bottom.
The protests and civil society campaign in the southeastern province of Kurdish population are under way. [Reuters]
Natasa noted the difference of discussions in the state structures and society, warning that the current incidents are seen as a destruction of improved relations.
"Such reactions should not represent the common part of Turks.
In response to the independence issue of the state, it was always mixed with a different approach of civil and military options as different groups in the political option, "he said.
Recent arrests and laws are the continuation of a more historic process.
"In the past few months, two and a half years after the arrests, the PKK and the Kurdish Independent Anti-Independent (Kan and Independent Anti-Independent) writer Aliza Marcus said," In the past two years, more than 2,000 people have been arrested for political activists in the past two years. "
The upcoming elections are also expected to result in a victory of the AKP, which is currently in power.
The remaining seats will likely be located with the Republican Peoples' Party (CHP) and the conservative Military Movement Party (MHP) and independence.
As the BDP does not stop the 10% election threshold for entering parliament, the party must open its candidates as independent.
If these candidates won 20 or more seats, a bloc could affect the parliament agenda, he said.
This is such a result, when the BDP, a number of laws supported by the Kurds, is the last one of the last quarter of a series of laws, is unprecedented.
According to Barkey, the parties' highest status is the skills of "almost a unique boycott" against a referendum on constitutional amendments last year.
Following the AKP elections, the model of the 1980s military coup was passed and promised to make broad reforms in the constitution, which is a major product.
"The Kurds are expected to do something serious and great," Barkey said. "The problem is that the Kurdish issue is a point of the constitution, which is really really prevented to progress in the Kurdish rights and Kurdish relations," he said.
The opportunity to take place in preparation for constitutional reform and strengthen minority rights is very important by the BDP and the Kurdish population.

Natasa stressed that nationalist demands have created only part of the Kurdish platform.
According to him, something can be valued in the constitution could be "proof of factors in the region, as well as a more participant citizens that can encourage more positive relations between the Kurds in Turkey and the state".
Meanwhile, mutual threats and accusations are under way.
In the past two weeks, BDP candidate for the Kurdish independent independent Kurdish, Luxemical Tube, announced that the Kurds would "build their own democracy" if the state does not do.
Erdogan refused to "the Kurdish problem", but State Minister Bureau Arhanc intervened immediately and made a statement that the AKP has recognised the problem.
Meanwhile, PKK Chairman Abdullah Ocalan warned that if an agreement between the government and the Kurds were not reached, there could be broad violence after June 15th.
Although the potential for a positive change after the elections is really realistic, a solution is not expected in the short term, and there is many ways to be done.
"The institutions are not changed," Natasa said, adding that the real change and consensus "will always take time and can take steps in the rest."
"I hope that the work will go before entering," he told SETimes.

Serbian presidential race could be "a serious turn point"
Despite nine candidates for the presidential elections in Serbia on Sunday, polls show that only two -- European President Boris Tadic and Serbian Radical Party candidate Tomislav Nikolic -- are the chance to win.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 17 / 01 / 08

Most analysts in Belgrade believe on Sunday (January 20th) the upcoming presidential elections in Serbia will decide on the future of the country and European integration.
Although he is nominated for the political president, the candidate of the Democratic Party and current Serbian President Boris Tadic and Serbian Radical Party deputy leader Tomislav Nikolic.
Tadic, who arrived in 2004, argues that Serbia is accelerating EU integration.
Nikolic argues that Russia is on the ground and Moscow must be invited to form a military army in Serbia.
Nikolic also said he would nominate Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj, who is indicted for war crimes at The Hague tribunal.
Tadic and Nikolic agree on a matter, thus that Serbia does not recognise Kosovo independence.
The province, a majority of ethnic Albanian, has been under UN administration since 1999.
Kosovo Albanians announced they will declare independence within a few weeks, with the United States and Europe 'main countries.
A third political -- Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica -- could be defined.
Polls suggest Tadic can only defeat all partners of the ruling coalition, especially in the support of Kostunica ’ s Democratic Party of Serbia.
Kostunica, however, opposes the plan for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the union, even if Tadic sent a mission to Kosovo as scheduled for the EU.
He insists that the EU cannot support both Kosovo 'independence and sign the SAA with Serbia.
For now, Kostunica has chosen to support Velimir Ilic, a coalition partner in the previous parliamentary elections and is expected to win 8%.
Liberal Democratic Party leader Cedomir Jovanovic, the only candidate for Kosovo &aposs independence.
Jovanovic, such as Ilic, is expected to win around 8% of the vote Sunday.
Other five candidates are expected to win less votes.
According to the law, none of the candidates in the first round of voting failed to win over 50% of the vote, the first two candidates must join the second round.
This round is the most votes.
According to surveys conducted by the Belgrade Centre for Free Elections and Democracy, half of the injured will be very attractive.
Nikolic is expected to win about 1.15 million votes in the first round, enabling Tadic against Tadic, which is expected to win 105 million votes.
The turnout rate will play an important role on the outcome.
The low turnout could be injured to the Radicals, which are very disciplinary.
However, Strategic Marketing Director Srdjan Bogosavljevic said that Nikolic is very weakened for the first round, because the remaining seven candidates are likely to take 25% of the votes ".
Bogosavljevic said Serbia is facing a "very serious turning point when it comes to power change".
Security Council disagrees on Kosovo status
During a Security Council meeting Wednesday, Russia warned that if Kosovo declared independence, the UN or other international political organisations would never participate in UN or other international political organisations, Western countries reiterated their support for the province 'progress towards becoming a state.

"Kosovo will not be a member of the UN if they are moving towards a unilateral declaration, it will not be a member of international political institutions," Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vitalli Curkin, told reporters. [Getty Images]
The UN Security Council gathered on Wednesday (January 16th) to assess the UN Security Council report on UNMIK operations and developments in Kosovo over the past three months.
The report warns that failing to make progress towards resolving the province &aposs future status would jeopardise regional stability and the UN will jeopardise its winners in Kosovo.
"In the process of determining the future status of Kosovo, the Security Council and the international community should continue to be one of the top priorities," Ban said.
Following a 18-month agreement between Belgrade and Pristina, the leaders of the 90 per cent ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo plan to declare a unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia.
Serbian President Boris Tadic, who has offered the province to become a state and offered broad autonomy, urged the Security Council on Wednesday to block such a move.
Tadic also called for the continuation of talks for a acceptable reconciliation between both sides.
Tadic also assured the 15-nation organisation that his country would "not apply to violence and war".
However, if the violence in the province does not protect Kosovo Serbs, we are preparing to help protect the population under a threat, "he added.
Welcoming Tadic &aposs promise that Serbia would avoid violence from Serbia, US Ambassador to the UN Zalilzad urged Belgrade to avoid "economic measures" for the province, including the absence of the electricity supply to Kosovo.
He also cautioned that the country has not taken steps to overcome long-term relations with the EU countries, where most of the United States and most are expected to recognise an independent Kosovo or not an independent Kosovo.
Russia, one of the five members of the Security Council 'right to veto, has supported Serbia in its stance on the right to become a state, and said it would veto the UN resolution on the future of Kosovo.
Russian Ambassador to the UN, Vitalli Curkin, said on Wednesday that the province &aposs final status is not an EU issue, and that member states must prepare for a compromise solution.
He also warned that an independent Kosovo will never be a member of UN or international political organisations.
"Kosovo will not participate in a full recognition of the international community by electing a unilateral action," he said.
Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who was allowing the Council to speak at the closure of Wednesday, voiced determination to move forward on the path of independence of the province, saying it is necessary for regional stability.
"Kosovo has domestic democratic and multiethnic institutions and is prepared for a final decision," Taci said, promising that the province would be a "country that recognises all citizens".
He said he would work to establish a good relationship with Serbia.

Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Lutfi Buci urged Serbs living in the province on Thursday (April 6th) to return to interim institutions.
He said the society "should not be removed by the Belgrade politics".
"The future of them is in Kosovo and institutions," he said.
Kosovo Serb representatives, however, say they are not ready to return.
"We think we will do, but we do not want to do," said Rancel Noykic, a member of the Serbian delegation in the talks with Pristina at the same time.
Serbs have boycotted Kosovo politics for two years, saying their assets are only vacation.
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen charged on Wednesday that Serbia is difficult to continue its boycott of the Kosovo Serb community and demand that the province does not give up their salaries from the province budget.
"It is the responsibility of all Kosovo Serbs to ensure confidence and guarantee minorities, but Belgrade must participate in the constructive participation, so that it can be fully affected," Jessen-Petersen said.
In addition to the request of the Kosovo Co-operation Centre in Belgrade, Serbs are seeking to give them up to their salaries, as well as to the supervised subsidies by Serbia.
The move affects Serbs who serve as local government, health and education institutions.
The impression of this is equal independent from all Kosovo Serbs from Belgrade to subsidies.
The aim of the Co-ordination Centre says the move is to raise differences and tensions between Kosovo Serbs.

While praising the progress achieved by countries in the region on the road to development, Papandreou noted the need to speed up reforms.
"The rule of law has not yet been a strong position, and organised crime still remains an important issue that must be done," he said.
Over the past four years, the commissioners participated in the Athens conference said there are significant economic and political achievements in Southeast Europe over the past four years, but also agreed that there are many things in the fields of stability, stability, institution and good governance.

There are still tensions in northern Kosovo
While Serbs promised to resist Kosovo authorities to take over border crossings, roads in the north have been closed with barricades.
By Igor Jovanovic and Muhamet Brajshori for Southeast European Times in Belgrade and Pristina -- 14 / 09 / 11
Kosovo Serbs are seen as a barrier in the village of Rudin, near Zvecan on July 30th.
On Tuesday (September 13th), barricades restored on Tuesday (September 13th), after Kosovo police plans to address control of border crossings in the north.
While the interim administration has yet to develop the crisis over the past few weeks, roads in northern Kosovo have already been closed to the barricades that want to protest border crossings in Kosovo on Tuesday (September 13th), local Serbs who want to protest Kosovo authorities.
Pristina said the local public would continue their plans on Friday, despite their objections.
"We are planning a series of peaceful protests and NGOs," Zubin Potok Mayor Slaka Ristic told SETimes. "We are unacceptable to the Kosovo customs crossings, because we will not accept the crossings of the border crossings, because we will be built by Serbia, and that state institutions will be built."
Four people have removed food routes and cocaine restaurants, or used trucks and bus to foster traffic.
As of Wednesday, traffic, completely or part of the main roads from Mitrovica have been blocked.
Leposavic, local people in the village of Leposavic, were only the only cheaper of traffic, to prevent KFOR transfer customs equipment to the Jarinje and Brnjak administrative border crossings.
In Zvecan, however, the local public has reportedly been allowed to overcome the consensus, after it assured that a KFOR council is not on border checkpoints, but to the Camp N" Hill in Leposavic.
While tensions are pushing, the Serbian government has said that stability in the region is on track, urging the EU, the UN and NATO to prevent Pristina "unilateral" movement.
The government suggested that the planned agreement was "jeopardised the continuation of dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina and the implementation of unilateral agreements on the status quo."
Kosovo authorities say they are determined to continue.

The prime minister has linked Belgrade to the EU process directly.
"EULEX -- Merkel must build this stage, because the trend will act with it," Sadiku said. "EULEX wants to spread the authority of Pristina and want to be part of any actions, rather than in July."
Security Studies Professor Abdullah Hajroi said Kosovo police and EULEX are prepared for any situation.
"It will not be tolerated, such as building or closing the doors," he told SETimes.
Mayor Ristic, however, said Kosovo Serbs should not be forced to accept the government of a country if they do not accept the legitimacy.
"The international community has not forced Albanians to accept Serbian institutions, therefore we will not have to accept Pristina institutions," Ristic said.
Aleksandar Mitic, head of the Kosovo Compromise project, said the Serbs are unsatisfied, but pressure is limited.
"Belgrade authorities have become a priority for EU membership and this should not be unfortunately when they were sentenced to the possibility of determined action on the Kosovo issue," Mitic told SETimes.

US Army Lieutenant Lieutenant General David Enst took over the commander of the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo only two months after NATO foreign ministers gave a condition for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to the Membership Action Plan (MAP).
However, BiH must resolve the problem of the exchange of various defence goods between the two sides.
He was headed with SETimes correspondent Vlado Kos and assessed how the country can reach this target.
SETimes: How do you see the political climate in the country after BiH approves a conditional MAP?
What is the good thing to reach an agreement on the army property?
Brigadier General David Ent: BiH has been working for NATO membership for years.
This shows that the long-term political consensus and reconciliation is not in the country.
The political environment in BiH is now under the effect of the October elections.
The need to fulfil the final requirement of the MEP was in the front of the elections, and the priority of defence goods is now a political issue.
However, this is not time to lose the movement in the direction of a wrong ideas that BiH is active in the MAP.
The operations in the MEP are based on the Year National Programme (ANP) and said BiH will not start the first ANP until the NATO defence property is resolved.
BiH can fulfil a requirement that NATO is implemented, but responsibility is reduced by BiH political leaders.
SETimes: The controversy on the MAP is almost no longer.
How can you say how much things are done?
Ent: Public opinion may be discussed, but there is no work in the government to prepare a ANP.
These are being conducted by the BiH Council of Ministers' Council of Ministers for NATO Co-operation.
The NATO programme, which is working on BiH, has a clear bridge between the ANP and the ANP.
In addition, the work of any possible ANP is now being held under the Independent Partnership Action Plan (IPAP), which is currently under way.
The issue of defence goods should be prepared to work under the BiH IPAP, if the next IPAP return was resolved in September.
SETimes: How will NATO play a role in facilitating talks on the army property of Sarajevo?
Ent: NATO &aposs Sarajevo Convention is working with the Defence Ministry and other sides to help solve this problem, and we continue to support these efforts.
We help the government or the entities to prepare the legal executive and bureaucracy research.
In addition, we have also drafted an inter-government agreement aimed at helping BiH to resolve this latest step towards the MAP.
SETimes: You took over the commander of the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo, another US officer.
Do you think that the presence of a US NATO headquarters commander is the future of NATO &aposs commitment to stability in BiH?
Ent: It shows that we are very important that the US role in NATO in Sarajevo, the Western Balkans and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a key elements of European security in the stability of Europe, when our military resources are under pressure.
But I am clear, this is not a US mission.
NATO ’ s unique characteristic character is from its ability to unite Europe and North American, and the decision in Sarajevo is an excellent example of the common vision.
SETimes: Do you welcome Republika Srpska (RS) for BiH to join NATO?
Ent: The benefits of joining NATO are increasing national and regional security, stability, economic development, more professional and economic army, more powerful democracy institutions and EU membership.
These benefits are more than 60 years and proven by 28 different countries.
People who live in RS can expect the same improvement in living standards.

British Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated London on Tuesday (July 27th) his strong support for Turkey ’ s EU bid, criticised the majority of the population for its full membership in the bloc.
Cameron, who visited Ankara for the first time since his post in May, emphasised that France has asked Britain to block its initiatives to join the European Economic Community, the predecessor in 1960.

Three categories against Turkey 'membership bid have met in the three categories: protecting the country' economic power, the prime minister said, enabling the celebrations and Islamic, who want to elect the country 'Eastern and the West.
"I will always define that the values of Islam is not complicated with European values, but not the values of Europe," Cameron said.
Turkey began accession talks with the EU in October 2005.
However, the process has been slow so far, since the country has failed to open talks on the 35 chapters that must complete the candidate countries.
This is largely the slow pace of Turkish progress in reforms and refused to open its ports and airports from the EU member Cyprus to traffic from Cyprus, which has led to fostering the size of the negotiating chapters.
Another factor affecting the pace of the talks is that France and Germany would be offered to offer a "concrete partnership" instead of full membership in the bloc after the completion of the negotiations.
While urging Turkey to "continue to implement the reforms needed for EU membership", Cameron also voiced "dissatisfaction" that the country is in order to block the accession process.
"I think that Turkey has done to defend Europe as a NATO ally, and today we are doing what we are doing in Afghanistan, we are doing that the European allies are doing in Afghanistan," Cameron said. "I believe that I would not be able to protect Turkey, but I believe that it will not be allowed to protect."
The two countries want to "open the way for Ankara to join Brussels", the British leader said, promising Turkey to promote the EU integration process and to "fight" for this.
Cameron signed a strategic partnership document to boost trade and defence relations with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday and stressed that the EU could benefit political and economic benefits.
Turkey, which has more young people in the 27-nation EU member states, is expected to capture Germany in the next six years, the bloc &ap91; most crowd] in the next six years.
The country is also preparing to become the second largest economy in Europe by 2050.
"Turkey is not more powerful than a European Union, but not more safe, more safe, even more safe, even more rich," Cameron stressed.

Nehrin is more popular, but in part of the Balkans, it has a stable potential for tourism.
Representatives of the regional countries and tourism sector hope to change the situation.
"It is necessary to work, but everything can be possible," Mihajlo Todic, a tourist centre in Belgrade, told Southeast European Times.
The company of Todic, Oscar Tur, is looking for travel programmes that have not been in Belgrade.
Todic says that these passengers are generally limited because "youth do not have the necessary money or even higher."
Visitors are spent a half days to see Tito 'loss, Karacorcevic' house in Oplenac and the monasteries in Fruska Gora.
Observers about the close history of the Cehrin are that context can see the details of the Yugoslav Army headquarters and the defence ministry.

"Tourists enjoy Belgrade and the people of Belgrade, especially beautiful women.
"They are facing a modern and limited metrouble with people of foreign literature, as they are waiting for a city in a space."
The rest of the Danube in Western Europe for years is one of the main assets of travel.
The Danube, which has a third of the markets, has been leaving the prominent Nil River for popular popularity.
The main tour of Germany was a season from the Passau, and the number of passengers have spent 130,000.
The prices of ten days of travel to the Passau or Advisi status have changed between 1340 and 3760 euros, while the three weeks of tourist rose to 4200 euros.
However, the southeastern parts of the Danube have so far received a small language.
Thus, natural behaviour, archaeological excavations, medieval monasteries and peaceful architecture have many tourists in the region.
Another decade has been removed for years.
Do you preferred the companies that organise visa-free travel, to an insufficient circulation?
In Vukovar, one of the other (Drava River) has two hundreds, including Osijek.

Tourists are also convicted of local monuments, such as Slavonija, Croatia, as well as widespread monuments, female monuments and frequently, Kopacki Rr, who is not worried.
As Sombor is on the river, Petroki Kaladin, known as the Danube Ceguitarch, is possible to see the Rir Capital, the biggest river in Europe.
The Bulgarian city of Russia is among the places that Bulgaria must see historical homes and historical goods during the river city of Paris is, which should be seen as "Paris", and the meggoman Nikolay Ceausku, who hosts the "People 'Assembly".
More than 300 fans and more than 100 pharmaceutical fans (more than 300 pharmaceutics), including the Danube draft, will replace the price of eastern goods.
The region is also the last house in Europe.
The Balkan economies, who need new tourists and tourism revenues to see the trip, are the ideal for equality.
More developments, better service and more effective promotion campaign, could turn the truth in one day.

The EU is ready to play a "top role" in Kosovo after the status issue is resolved, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Wednesday (March 28th), two days after UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari presented a final compromise proposal.
The document, drafted by the former Finnish president and submitted to the Security Council on Monday, envisions independence under the EU control, defined as a "only active option" for Kosovo.
"The decision on Kosovo is a European union," Rehn told the European Parliament (EP) committee on Wednesday.
"We should continue to support President Ahtisaari and his proposal at the UN Security Council.
There is no reason for the decision.
The UN has been managing Kosovo for eight years.
The status quo cannot be protected. "
The Security Council is expected to open Ahtisaari &aposs Kosovo plan and decide on the future status of the province this year, shortly after Britain took over the presidency in early April.
In a speech to the AP on Wednesday, Rehn said the EU "the biggest crisis mandate" is very progress in the mandate of management ".

This park will be the most of Kosovo &aposs debt to Yugoslavia, status practices, economic development needs and international presence.
"The resources are not only from the EU budget," Rehn said. "Our EU member states and international partners must share responsibility."
The EU expects the United States and international financial institutions to ensure a part of the resources.
Following the debate in the Security Council, the six countries, including the Kosovo Contact Group -- the United States, Germany, Britain, Italy and Russia -- gathered in London on Wednesday.
"The Contact Group continues to be part of a joint responsibility to promote peace in Kosovo and the region, despite its differences," Britain said in a statement to the Pristina poll bureau.
Russia, which is also one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, was the only country that opposed Ahtisaari in the Contact Group.
The country calls for continuing talks between Belgrade and Pristina.

Economy Minister Valjon Saracini said the rest will soon be removed.
"The reputation of the fixed laboratory will increase the safe consequences of the product, increase technical obstacles and accelerate free and services," Saracini told SETimes.
Such accommodations would affect various activities, including "environmental protection quality, overall technical security, goods and services' uncertainty and administrative authorities", Buro said in a press release.
He added that the conservative target is to implement the fraud and optimistic activities.
Apart from the Metrology Bureau, the Metrology Bureau aims to "offer a efficient service that can compete with international markets, especially in the region and the EU."

Despite the first match of the Military team played in the World Cup, Greeks do not leave optimistic exhibition and some hope the team will still go to the first 16.
In a country where he has long been a number of sports activities, there is no interest in the country.
Dimitris Kaimas, a sports professor of Greece 'state radio network, told SETimes that the number of fans, fans and the World Cup speaks about the general air.
SETimes: How do you celebrate the Greeks to join the World Cup?
Dimitris Kaimas: Many have been crowded in these days, as Karagounis, Gekas and other players are moving to monitor.
However, because of the crisis in the country, many people gathered in the house of their colleagues and exchange in their house, the teams have a idea on their strategies.
"If I have a technical coach," he said.
If we won a victory, these smaller meetings will be turned into huge groups where people are prepared to celebrate in their own square, as they are ready to celebrate the flags.
If there will be radical changes, they will ask and will seek a crime.
Several tourists from the European countries where the motto are headed, and they go to cafes or barricades to monitor their team.
SETimes: What is a few actors playing at the World Cup?
Kaimas: We will have the opportunity to monitor the players from Super Lig.
Gilberto Silva, the door of the national team, is the biggest name between them.
First, Super Lig, who has played in the French team after years, has come from the goals, Djigrl Cisk.
In addition, one of the first ten key figures in Sarkak is the Slovenian actor Zboo Strba, who played in PAOK and Skoda Xanthi, who played in the PAOK.
Rafik Djebband will play in Payreir and try to become a better port transfer from us.
Danny Fernanz, who played in Iraq, was among 23 players in the Portugal team, which is important for the Iraqi team, while Levadiakos' Ignacio Gonzalez plays a player.
SETimes: Do you have any measures on Greek fans?
Kaimas: We live in Sporta -- football, basketball, voluntarily and even even in recent cases of violence.
These incidents are the top news in foreign media.
All incidents include some patients between fans.
Apart from a few abuse, however, Greeks have not been able to see our national team.
There is no poor female fans.
Furthermore, they will not do anything [poor] to South Africa.
The Greek-Greek clubs have begun organised fans, then it would be a major danger.
SETimes: What is the Greek football team won the second time to join the World Cup?
Kaimas: It is even a winner.
Military team players won new experiences, and the Greek football player is the most important football event on the World.
The windows and losses will be defined by the team.
Our three matches are defeated and ten goals do not want to remember the 1994 World Cup of 1994, no one of us.
If it is the first 16 to 16, it would be a great success that proves that our presence is not a mandate.
The Greek football is unable to raise the rise, and the team seems to see our team as an average.
SETimes: Do you have an interest in Greek football players?
Kaimas: There is a great interest.
A large career from the World Cup began.
As Greece joined the tournament, some players are the possibility of opening new vehicles for the players.
Ninis, Sampras, Torosidis and Vyntra will likely be able to "ask the main European clubs".
Of course, there are separate things that are being transferred to interest.
That is time for them.

Cypriot leaders start new peace talks
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hopes Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot leaders will "significant progress" during intensive peace talks this month.

Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat launched the second round of UN support peace talks on Monday (January 11th) to end the 40-year division of Cyprus.
The six-day six-session -- which is completed on Wednesday (January 25th) -- will focus on issues, including two other leaders, governance, authority share, economy and the EU.
The property rights of property rights, one of the most popular topics of the talks, is on the agenda of the second round of talks, which ended on January 27th.
The process will monitor a two-month matter before the presidential elections in the north of the island in April.
Talat will be a candidate and is critical for the goal of achieving progress.
The talks will be held in the reputation of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon &ap91; Cyprus Special Representative Te Brook Zeroun.
After a nine hours meeting with Talat on Monday, Christofias told reporters that the talks focused on various aspects of the Cyprus administration.
"Everything is determined, and we have said that nothing will not be determined until it is determined," Christofias said, stressing that Christofias, nor Talat will withdraw from the talks.
"I hope that we will provide more compliance at the end of the day, which is our common goal."
The latest initiative to find a solution to the Cyprus issue ended in April 2004, when a UN-backed reunification proposal was rejected by Greek Cypriot voters.
The majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in the plan.
In May 2004, only the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot part of Cyprus joined the EU, which cleared the entire country.
Ankara recognises only the north of its Turkish administration.
The Peace process has stalled until September 2008, when Christofias and Talat launched a new round of direct talks with major hopes to reach a compromise by the end of last year.
After 60 meetings, the agreement still seems to be reached.
Ban expressed hope that the two leaders have reached an agreement on critical issues and "can make significant progress".
"I am convinced that I am committed to the commitment to ensuring concern that it is accomplished as the general general, as well as the preparation," the Cyprus News Agency quoted Ban as saying Monday.
Before the start of the talks, Turkish Cypriots submitted their recommendations on the management and authority share, but proposals rejected the Greek Cypriots as "unacceptable".
"These proposals cannot create a basic debate," Greek Cypriot government spokesman Stefanos Stefanou said on Sunday.
In recommendations to the Turkish Cypriot side last week, the Turkish Cypriot side is said to sign international agreements and include separate judges on control of the Cyprus airspace.
Last month, a survey suggested that Talat would be defeated by the radical Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister and National Union (UBP) leader Dervis Eroglu.
The UBP, who pushed for the continuation of the division between ethnic communities, said that a two-state model is the only basis for a solution.

In a annual report released last week, the European Commission (EC) said that almost all of the swimming areas in the Greek coastal coastal and internal water last year have met the highest quality standards of the EU.

In addition to these findings, the EC concluded that Greece is in accordance with the values of 99.8% of "cancer water".
However, the organisation said, it was not included in the report because of the delays in the monitoring programme of 830 other Greek swimming.
The EC report, published on June 10th, was conducted at the 2009 season, and has closed more than 20,000 season and river resorts in EU member states.
The survey found that 96% of the European coastal water supplies and 90% of waste swimming areas have met EU minimum water standards last year.
Both have been more better than 2008, while 80% of the European seaside areas and only 52% of exercise water areas have made significant progress since 1990, as normal areas.
"In the past 30 years, the EU and national regulations have improved the quality of European mechanisms in the past 30 years," EU Environmental Commissioner Janez Potocnik said in a statement on the release of the EU report. "We should continue to maintain our efforts to protect both our high quality skills."
Apart from Greece, Cyprus (9.1%), France (95.7%), Malta (9.3%) and Portugal (90.3%) were among other countries that have met the values of any trust in 2009.
Bulgaria, which attracted thousands of local and foreign tourists every summer, has 89 season coastal coastal coast and four exercises.
The country has been on the rise of the EU since it began to report on the quality standards after it joined the bloc in 2007.
Last year, 98.9% of the Bulgarian Black Sea players rose from 93.3% in 2008, with difficult values.
"The competence rate of values from 78.7% to 91%," the EC said in a separate country report.
Romania, one of the three EU member states that report to Cyprus and Malta for the coastal zones, has been a subject to the tender of its southern neighbour.
All of the 49 sea coastal coastal resorts participated in the survey, but only fourth, or 8.2% of them were in accordance with values in 2009.

Bosnia and Herzegovina Chief of Civil Authority
Bosnia and Herzegovina recently accepted the European Civil Affairs Conference, is only one of the stalemate on local authorities in the country to take over.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 20 / 01 / 03
Bosnia and Herzegovina recently attended the European Civil Azerbaijan and Yugoslavia (ECAC) Conference (ECAC).
"We must be in the discrimination of domestic or other major challenges that these new members have to overcome in some cases to join the ECAC," said Conference President Alhdo Romdo.
For Bosnia and Herzegovina, the process is part of the local units in the country, to overcome the challenges, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
"We have nominated a major development of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Commission and the International Airport Organisation (BiH), since three years," said Yves Lambert, co-ordinator of the European Commission and International Airport.
Lambert assessments said the country has shown great development between June 2002 and June 2002, when its visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina was invited for membership in October 2001.
NATO units have been under control of all airspace in the country since the end of the war in 1995, but the balance was slowly slow to local authorities.
A deal signed between SFOR and NGOs on July 1st, for example, was initially launched by the Sarajevo Airport to the first phase of civilian officials from the SFOR Airport.
Furthermore, security, rescue and emergency medical conditions -- civilian airport officials and municipal service units have met their duties in a air exercise exercise exercise exercise in May.
Local authorities are preparing to take over the exercise of the Sarajevo Airport by the end of the year.
Hundreds of foreign units have allowed the new Civil Affairs Committee, which will depend on the formation of the new unit, the Office of the High Representative and other ministries and airport units.
The Committee will be responsible for developing the civil banking institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina to develop security -- monitoring and monitoring the processes of monitoring and to ensure the standards of the airport organisations participated in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Lambert says the project is not the final goal of the project, which is providing the equality of the ECAC membership.
The Sarajevo Airport has been dealing with its own training weapons since January 1st, and the Bana Luka Airport has been dealing with its own experiences for two years.
The Mostar Airport is expected to have its own experiences by the end of 2003.
Another step aiming is the participation of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Air Authority (OHO), which is the Federal Airport Agency in Europe.
The OHO is a responsible organisation to organise air monitoring and airport operations.
"We must make progress in the fields of monitoring and other areas, but this is the next target that we have to achieve," Lambert said.
Tourism Regional Croatia
The developing tourism sector in Croatia has played an important role in the country &aposs efforts to restore its image after the conflict in the 1990s.

Following the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s, Croatia was turned to tourism to create a new and poor image image.
In a relatively short time, the country has been able to spread both visas and trade.
This year, Croatia expects an increase of 3 per cent to 5 per cent, while the figure is expected to create a 10 per cent increase in the financial consequences of the tourism sector.
Croatia seems to be the interest of tourists, although it is a threat to the European tourism sector in general.
However, experts say Croatia must continue achieving achievements so far.
The method of this is a effective campaign, including a "maritime slogical sloan" in the world.
As an example of application, Franco was given to Spain to end the international isolation after the 1975 death in 1975.
The country organised an aggressive campaign based on the slog of "Each Children".
Today, Croatia faces similar challenges.
Officials, meanwhile, stressed the need for the country to have the necessary facilities and services to overcome the number of visitors.
Tourism Minister Bozidar Kalmeta expressed dissatisfaction with the preparation of some Croatian communities due to delays.
At the same time, the government also focused on the control of the coastal coastal coastal coastal and a huge problem for the coastal coastal coast.
Authorities say illegal structures have been improved because of an easy winning money, without sufficient investment.
The head of the East-West Company, Thomas Croswell, believes the creation of image is a significant effect of the countries' ability to become successful in the international arena.
However, he says, tourism is only one of the sectors that will benefit the development of a country and benefit from the development of image.
As Croatia continues to develop its image with the tourism sector, foreign policy achievements such as the European Commission 'recent positive report will help improve tourism, analysts say.

Despite all traffic conditions, Soldo was satisfied with the fact that the big summer ption has found the way to return to the Adriatic, because experts have found that this type of generation in the past 40 years.
The people who have begun the six world are still in the job, he added.
Experts think the large summer balance in the Adriatic will be removed from the Adriatic as soon as possible.

Serbian drug barricades exercise accusations

Saric is estimated to win more than 100m euros from drug trafficking. [Getty Images]
Only four months after the latest indictment, the type of drug trafficking, Darko Saric, has been charged with money laundering. On Monday (August 9th), Serbian prosecutors have accused Serbian prosecutors and eight other drug money in Vojvodina.
They include Saric, as well as Radovan Strbac and his wife, Dubravka Strbac, Stevica Kostic, Zoran Djopic, Andrija Kraslovic, Marinko Vucetic, Predrag Milosavljevic and Nebojsa Jestrovic.
However, Saric and Copic are still at large.
According to Organised Crime Special Prosecutor Miljko Radisavljevic, the defendants won about 20m euros from the sale of the kidney, and then the bank guarantees used for privatisation of public enterprises.
According to Radisavljevic, the money was invested in the central Senta company, Mladi Borac, Novi Sad Sad company Putnik, Mimrem and Subotica Palic company.
The financial investigation into these companies was launched.
Though the defendants outside Saric did not agree on drug trafficking, they are responsible for illegal revenues and financial channels.
Radisavljevic said several coastal companies have been established to pay the money as part of the plan to Serbia, to pay the accounts of domestic companies.
Some of the money was invested as transport to Novi Sad Metal Bank.
Serbian media sources predict the cost of Saric has spent 100m euros from drug trafficking.
In April, the special prosecution prosecutor Saric and South American indicted 19 people suspected of missing 2.5 tonnes.
"Darko Saric and Zoran Djopic are still at large, and we have suggested that they were tried to be tried for them," Radisavljevic told the new charge of money laundering.
The Prosecutor believes the defendants must be tried in a single trial, due to the lack of compliance, "the prosecutor said.
If he was arrested and captured, Saronic could be sentenced for several years.
Serbia adopted a new money laundering law in March, aimed at accelerating corruption and meet international standards.
Serbian police said Saric could be hiding in the region.
According to Veselin Veljovic, however, the head of the Montenegrin police, the indictment was unable to leave the Balkans and leave the South Africa.
Serbian security director Milorad Veljovic told SETimes that police are doing everything to find Saric and help.
"This is not only the interest of Serbian police and the state, but also the interest of the entire Balkan region," he said.
The findings that police have achieved are not in Serbia, he said, but the investigation has not entered details over the rest of the suspect for the initiative.
According to analysts, RS possibilities for division

Despite the campaign ahead of the October elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), authorities in Republika Srpska have already begun to discourse the voters' interest.
Authorities are expected to defend Serbs in BiH and say they could have to leave a day.
Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, leader of the ruling Democratic Union of Independent Social Democrats (SDSM) and Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, revive his pro-independence rhetoric in both the 2006 elections and parliament.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which estimates Dodik, is close to Kosovo (ICJ), analysts say on July 22nd, has not been violated by the international law.
The Bosnian Serb leader rejected the division, but said it could happen.
"The discrimination of RS is not detailed, but for the status issue," Dodik said. "Of course, we can see us a battle that BiH is not a country.
Dodik and his party have passed a law that allows a referendum on independence.
The law took effect on April 20th.
Sacir Palandra of the University of Sarajevo said the ICJ decision is losing debate.
"In the coming years, certain movements are expected to be made to RS in order to ensure the loss of Kosovo," he said.
Therefore, he said, BiH must take action when it comes to Pristina and its own relationship.
"I believe the initiatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina to recognise Kosovo are consistent.
The question is not important for Bosnians and Croats in BiH, and this is only a precondition for the country and the internal situation in the region, "he said.
Miodrag Zivanovic, professor of the Banja Luka Felfe Foundation in Banja Luka, said the goal of any secession would be destroyed.
"This means that the RS people still live in the sanctions, which is whereabouts, the Serbs have returned to BiH," Zivanovic said.
He and Zivanovic agree that Belgrade has a strong influence on the Bosnian Serb administration.
Zivanovic believes that Belgrade should reduce its effect on Banja Luka, as "Serbia and Bosnia are the two countries that need to have their own policies".
However, he sees "both bad and good entity" in the relationship.
"The unit is the use of Belgrade to use RS.
If the entity, politicians in RS are not independent when national strategic decisions are.
Belgrade is more serious and realistic international law actors, and this is better for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire region, "he said.
Reconstruction prices and developing economies restore global shield
Economists are interpreted in different fronts of the rise of prices, which are being seen in the oil prices today, and the rise of the economic stagnation in the 1970s.
Observers suggest that the market will return to the balance of China and India economies, which have been resolved, as the problems such as the refinery capacity are resolved, while some say the market is increasing competitiveness and the risk of global global warming, and are more complicated.
In the past, technological developments and the market forces have been discovered, although it was in part.
Nevertheless?
According to former Romanian Finance Minister Daniel Daianu, the economic, political, strategic and ecological problems should not be registered.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest – 02 / 01 / 06
Everything has been worried, when it comes to the rest of the Petroleum.
In September, when the presence was reacted to around 70-65), analysts have begun to evaluate the next wife.
Regardless, it is clear that it is the same as the price of the price, which is a crowd of the stagnation in Western economies by 80 years ago.
At the time, oil produced Arab countries used this strategic product as a economic and political weapons, and many times the oil oil supplies have been closed to the resort.
This price means a serious change of trade between the countries that export oil and oil imports between the countries that have exported oil.
Today, the high oil prices are questioning the problem: the current situation does not show gasoline with the previous year? [File]
Regional and industrial countries stopped to slowly slowdown the economies of the oil supply (even mind) and slowed the growing budget deficits.
The price increase in industrial products has been balanced by the increase in oil prices.
The economic stalemate and high inflation (Paul Volecker, the same time, was closed to 20 per cent before the US Central Bank of American, many macroutical economists were translated into a lot of macroeconomic economist. At a time, the Kids had been cautioning how inflation has been used.
As a result, the conscription of a new scenario has been expanded to cover a new scenario. According to the architecture, a powerful supply has been affected by the resources of the economy to revive this type.
In such a case, stagnation and high inflation were inevitable.
The book that Western economies live, the former communist countries could be said to have been affected by more than several years later.
Following the possibility of trade in the Western countries' strategic goods, the post-communist countries have to deal with institutional reforms and restructuring of resources after the Soviet trade bloc was destroyed.
The Esasen Soviet bloc countries have been less affected by the oil crisis, as they use the SSCB cheaper oil.
The worst impression of the crisis was the poor countries that import oil, because these countries have received two couples: a greater oil supply and prices, and increasing industrial products.
Today, the high oil prices are questioning the problem: the current situation does not show gasoline with the previous year?
Meanwhile, details in the refinery capacity are a problem that has achieved more serious divisions, including natural disasters, Katrina and Rita, as a result of natural disasters.
Furthermore, oil supplies have not been increased in recent years.
In politically, there will be no interest in the market, if the details of the supplies will be implemented.
However, there is an important difference: the rise of Asian economies, particularly China and India, is an additional pressure on oil and gas markets.
The price increase in industrial products has increased by the increase in oil prices. [File]
What is the main question: What is the possible effects of the new global economic substantial effects on the prices of prices, which creates the network of modern economies?
The fight against the control of key resources could be spread, and a disappointment scenario, which is also on the rise of prices.
Following a report by the Roman Club two years ago, Meadows' '' 'Reconstruction' '' '' report 'Studies'.
In addition, the question of the problem that the circumstances in the embassic markets will be a serious change, the global dynamics professor Jay Forforter (MIT) was developed by the Forrester Modeter (MIT).
This Malththusian views the use of alternative energy resources for the new oil prices, but in part of technological developments and market forces.
How can it be possible to trust technology and see the opportunities?
It is possible, but China and India must take account.
Due to pressure on the oil and gas market of Asian economies, the demand will continue in the coming years.
Even if this situation, the oil prices can be said to have a report that the oil prices will not decrease in the near 40th.
In addition, the price increase has been relatively stopped, but consumption and production are necessary.
The worst impression of this situation is still poor, especially those of energy imports.
The various interests are possible.
In the coming years, the competition on the control of the areas of oil and gas has been focused on the control of the areas, which will increase geopolitical and safety concerns, which will increase oil and gas, and a greatest search process of oil and gas, will also be more important, and specifically certain economies will decide their foreign policies.
At the time when the effects of the global global warming have been seen and concerned, industrial companies want to become more competitive, the classified issue of ecological issues is also the basis of the conflict.
Supreme oil and gas prices have slowly slowed growth and causing inflation.
Therefore, there are significant markets that need to be clear policies and high-profile profit accounts, both companies and governments.
In these new circumstances, a new turnout could be seen as a result of energy austerity.
If the measures must be implemented by one time, the private company and public budget will be more difficult, if the measures are not implemented.
Regional oil transport market faces hard competition

Several days in the Southeast Europe energy market, where many countries have been discussed -- the Caspian oil oil and even the goal of transport gas to the West -- are moving forward to oil transport projects.
The region has begun to restore the lessons of oil reputation, paving at least three pipelines projects that would strengthen local economies.
However, none of the projects did not have the EU &ap91; uncertainty] support.
Many EU experts have expressed concern that some pipelines would affect their relations with Russia as a result.
Nevertheless, Brussels is not a simple that will determine whether the project will be transferred before the first time, and that it will have a connection with the rich Caspian port, which has yet to be closed on hundreds of trils of oil.
Petroleum experts think the final decision would give Moscow to the Russian oil, as the major part of the oil stock, which will be registered.
Many EU countries in the energy needs worry that Russia has stopped its oil exports.
In one side, Brussels is based on the basis of oil transport, the competitiveness in the Southeast Europe oil transport market is even more simply.
The first move was to announce a new attempt by Romania, which was launched by the Pan European Petroleum Exchange (PEOP) in late January.
As part of the initiative, including Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia, the Romanian port of the Black Sea will be linked to the Italian port of Trieste.
The pipeline will send control over the regional energy market, and will contribute to the European and the Middle East oil to become less dependent on Russian and Middle East.
The news was announced during the visit of Italian Prime Minister Romo Prodi in Bucharest.
The project reiterated Rome 'support for the 1319km pipeline.
According to supporters of the PEOP, the initiative has a "huge" stock ": a current" debt stock "in Trieste, which is linked to a current" debt from Alps.

The project has been awaiting for years, since some states do not agree on various issues, particularly transport taxes.
As a result of the first feasibility study, the project budget is set to be worth around 2.4 billion.
The talks began in 1994, but there were no progress in political circumstances and regional conflicts.
Furthermore, the Italian daily Il Piccoo has faced continuous delays because of the project financing details and minimal decisions.
The Rome and Bucharest, which has been repeatedly left the past in recent years, are clear that the project is willing to improve.
The PEOP has become a key target in Romania &aposs energy policy, due to the more developed rival projects that have already been approved by the Balkans and so far from Russia.
One of the most important opponents of the PEOP is the Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline, which will carry Russian oil to a Greek port of the Black Sea coast in Bulgaria.
According to Greek news agency ANA, the cost of the 285km-long pipeline is around 800m euros, and the annual capacity for the beginning is 35m tonnes of oil, according to the Greek news agency ANA.
After years of delays, Greece, Russia and Bulgaria have decided to take action.
A three-unilateral working group gathered in the Bulgarian city of Burgas has revealed the first inter-state agreement to build the pipeline.
Russian President Vladimir Putin urged Greece and Bulgaria to reach a final agreement before.
"If Bulgarian and Greek partners do not agree on a memorandum of understanding, we will stay on our exports to other countries, and in addition to Bulgaria and Greece, the EU should be interested in the implementation of this project," Putin said at a annual press conference on February 2nd.
According to many experts, Moscow is not only the latest movements of the PEOP, but also a third opponent project in the region, the AMBO pipeline, which envisions the guarantee of the AMBO pipeline, which envisions linking Bulgaria, Macedonia and Albania.
Under an agreement signed in Skopje in late January, the third pipeline is scheduled to transport Caspian oil to Burgas in Bulgaria 'Black Sea port in the Black Sea and later to the Albanian port of Vlora in the Mediterranean.
After years of heavy labour study, the 850km pipeline could be the most optimistic scenario of the 850km pipeline, with an estimated 35m tonnes of biometric metres and around 1.3 billion euros annually, according to the end of 2010.

He also stopped in Samir and Potocari on Monday (July 11th), where he promised to make each other in 1995. On Monday (July 11th), the Kingdom was abandoned his son -- the prospects of all the territorial aspects.
"Most of the skept, the excavations [are] mistakes], whereabouts are not waiting for the time," he told SETimes.
I am not the only beginning, I have no one who will do Samir for the time.
I want to know that it is doing, "he said.
Nevertheless, the Meyrem Express is on the brother.
At the same time, Meyrem was only eight.
Now it is difficult.
"It was here, and even a step forward.
Today, I have a candidacy for the last time, "he said.
In Potocari, the loss of Bosniaks in the 1995 massacre and the massacre of Bosniaks, the most beautiful day of the year.
More than 600 people were injured on Monday, and 164 were killed.

Thousands of people attended the ceremony. [Bedrana Kaletovic / SETimes]
"I lost everything.
I repeatedly saw the death of the most behaviour, and I believe some will remain in Potocari in 1995.
"I have not been here, here here, and I have always been leaving them," he said.
On Monday, about 40,000 people participated in the ceremony, including local and international community representatives, families, friends and neighbours.
"We have to law for victims who are still awaiting for the detention," US Ambassador to Bosnia Patrick Moon said at the ceremony. "The arrest of Ratko Mladic is a more reason for us to reflect the crimes against humanitarian people here in Srebrenica, and not to reflect them in the world."
Despite the political scene, no representative of the Serbian government was not participated in the ceremony.
The Serbian NGO, however, attended the ceremony.
"It is to reinforce, destroy and hidden our own dignity.
"We are very exaggerated by the country, when a country is surrendered to Ratko Mladic, the culture, science and media part of the judiciary, punishment and the rule of law," he said.
At the ceremony, more than 6,000 members of the Peace Implementation attended the ceremony for three days to exercise the way from Srebrenica in 1995.
In Potocari, more than 50,000 victims of the July 1995 massacre were discovered.
The 188 other victims of the disappointment were abandoned in other places after the families' request.
According to official figures, 8,365 people were killed and more than 365 people are still awaiting to be hidden or identified in mass graves.

In relations between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) leaders, the leaders of Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have opened a new page last week in relations between the two countries.
Serbian President Boris Tadic and BiH Presidency Chairman Haris Silajdzic made a joint declaration highlighting a "joint visa-free" for the future.
The agreement was made by Turkish President Abdullah Gul.
"The development of a joint visa-free vision that countries can live in peacekeeping, stability and good neighbourly relations, should be developed," the statement said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has been sentenced for months between the two countries.
"This session is the first example of its kind since the Bosnian conflict," Davutoglu told the Sabland daily on April 24th.
"For all, security, high-level political dialogue, interim economic dependence and the protection of multiethnic, multiethnic and multiethnic society in the region", the statement said.
"If Bosnian politicians in the region will be part of the new, poor trust in the region, the entire region will affect normalisation and stability," Dusan Reljic, a researcher at the German Institute for International Affairs and Security in Berlin, told SETimes.
Aleksandar Fatic, head of the Belgrade Centre for Security Studies, said the meeting would open the way for Belgrade to establish direct communication, not through Republika Srpska (RS) authorities.
"The best guarantee of good relations between Belgrade and Sarajevo to protect the RS status of the Dayton Peace Accords -- the best guarantee of the RS political elite -- and a potential conflict between Bosniak leaders in the Federation of BiH and the Federation of BiH could lead to the international community," Fatic told SETimes.
"Serbia will never destroy the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina," Tadic said at a meeting of the weekend.
He stressed that the new beginning would mean a new period to boost regional co-operation.
In response, Silajdzic said, "Bosnian people are very important to do so."
Both countries want to join the EU, with hope that this compromise process will help achieve their goals.
Analysts say Turkey has also strengthened its position on EU membership by organised the meeting.
"Turkey aims to become one of the main foreign affairs in Southeast Europe," Reljic said. "Turkey aims to be one of the main foreign affairs factors in Southeast Europe," he said. "Turkish mediator diplomacy, economic and financing projects, and in the region are not limited to traditional dependence on traditional ties that are limited to
"There is no doubt that we have come to this point," said Sami Kohen, a foreign policy columnist at the Turkish daily Milliyet on Tuesday (April 27th). "The architecture of this meeting could be said to be Davutoglu."
Banja Luka analyst Tanja Topic described the declaration as a strong step towards normalising regional relations.
The new political initiatives in this direction could cause the weak of radical nationalist politicians in RS, Topic added.
"If the steps taken in the region during the past period are sustainable by Croatia and Serbia, such negative reactions could soon be discovered and RS radical politicians can become only political defendants," Topic told SETimes.
The agreement did not happen without negative consequences.
Nebojsa Radmanovic, a Serbian member of the BiH presidency, described the constitution as a violation of the constitution because Silajdzic signed the declaration without signing the version of the two other presidency members.
"Silajdzic and Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj were in Istanbul for an official visit, and therefore they cannot accept any documents on BiH," Radmanovic said.
"This response shows that RS leaders have shown their loss of a number of shares in relations with Serbia," Topic said.
During the meeting, Gul noted the importance of establishing regional relations and continue.
"The Balkans have always been peacekeeping and stability -- this time we will be very important for the EU and NATO structures," Gul said. "The normalisation of relations between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is very important."
Milan, a 71-year-old pension in Belgrade, said Serbs are not easy to organise their options against Turkey.
"We know what is the first relationship with Turks in Serbia -- 500 years have lived under the labour," Milan said. "However, there has been many things so far.
"If we have a few consequences in Serbia, we are going to invest."
Montenegro does not wish to open property market
Concerned about the purchase of more property in the country, Montenegrin leaders cannot agree on the removal of restrictions at the real estate market.

Two years after Montenegro declared independence, controversial debate on the liberalisation of flexibility laws in the small Adriatic country, Russian and other foreigners are increasing concerns about the purchase of a large amount of supplies in the country.
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, a major partner of the coalition -- the Socialist Party of Socialist Party, has been completely liberalised by the property market.
However, the Social Democratic Party, the other partner of the coalition, shares the same idea with the opposition, which wants to restrict restrictions that the country has stopped from Montenegro.
The government, which is scheduled to discuss this issue, withdrew a draft law on foreigners' property rights, under which parliament is scheduled to discuss the principal session of parliament.
According to the constitution, such a law must provide a two-thirds majority for parliament.
As part of the current laws, foreign commercial persons can buy property in Montenegro, while foreign individuals do not have this rights.
In Pratikte, many foreign -- with the aid of Montenegrin witnesses -- has established a company and closed this restriction after it purchased its property.
In Montenegro, a government court discovered "no foreign people who do not have an economic operation in Montenegro" cannot be able to have a resort.
However, the decision is not considered and not implemented.
Statistical data prove the importance of this issue. In the 11-month period, 53 per cent of the Foreign Investment Investment, worth 900m euros, was made as part of a total of 53 per cent.
Meanwhile, the amount of capital flexible from the country has found 450m euros -- the figure is almost equal for the amount of investment.
Montenegro, who sell its own property, is using the country to purchase flexibility, instead of external trade deficit and use new investments to increase employment, but also in Belgrade and Novi Sad.
Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic, who is responsible for international economic relations, refused to sign the government "unfortunate conditions".
"In the law, there should be a similar idea on the state of the state," Djurovic said, arguing that "In the coastal part of the law, the public goods should be used by some special judges that will be recognised in the framework, which will be recognised by convention, pollution and gasoline contracts," he said.
However, Staff of the Lawyers' Association, Secretary-General Branislav Radulovic believes that insisting on reality, "there is no strong claim".
"I am suspected that the reality requirement will be 13.8kkm of Montenegro, and I would be able to protect the interests of the country," Radulovic said.
For example, Russia is not completely unfair when it comes to it, "he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Gordana Djurovic, who is responsible for international economic relations, revised the government to sign the real estate code, with "unable conditions". [Montenegrin government]
"Montenegro can use consultations with foreign investors as Bulgaria," Radulovic said. "Bulgaria has not signed a territorial sale agreement with foreign investors -- instead of the summer agreements, allowing investors to use them for 99 years.
In this case, protecting its territorial owner, it was also the way to protect manipulation and compliance agreements. "
Predrag Mitrovic, head of the Labour Union, warns that the state should take into account the experience of European countries and other countries in the region.
"The countries managed by liberal laws have found themselves as a result of the economic terror, as they sell their territory in exchange of money abroad, abroad," Mitrovica said.
Such liberal laws should be dangerous for smaller states such as Montenegro, and I think that the state should not be more active on this issue, "he said.
Predrag Stamatovic, an adviser to the finance ministry, believes the state will not restrict the rights of private property, including the transfer of judges to another bit.
"How do you have the right to condemn the way for the development of the country and foreign capital," Stamatovic said, noting that the tax revenue of the tax revenue, which took over 40m euros in the budget last year.
During recent talks last year, Montenegro ended with a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, paving the property market to open its citizens of the EU.
The agreement is expected to be implemented in 2010 after the 27 EU member states approved by parliament.
Montenegro will begin talks on all the chapters of the bureau, as Montenegro is a candidate for joining the EU.
The European Commission will monitor Montenegrin laws and assess what the EU criteria are complicated.
The property rights of EU citizens will be discussed as part of the free movement of goods and capital.
In the past, these chapters have been the most difficult processes for candidate countries, who do not want to give the right to overcome the beautiful club.
Croatia, for instance, has not been finalising talks on the free movement of the capital.
European Commission experts have discovered that Croatian laws are not in line with European standards in the two years ago.
Despite the EU warnings, Croatia is slowly slow, "legal amendments" that would allow the EU citizens to be the right to become an extraordinary school in Croatia ", according to the EC.
However, other documents on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and other documents must complete the process of liberalising the property market by 2009.
Germany, Belgium, Great Britain, France, the Netherlands and Spain may have a flexible climate in Croatia, based on monopoly agreements.
However, because of the administrative bureaucracy, this process could spend two years.
Therefore, those who want a property owner in the country have applied to the direction in Montenegro, creating a company in Croatia earlier, and then they have an unrest of any restrictions.
All new members of the EU have tried to lift the property sale of foreigners, if they were held in talks with the EC, or in the second or economic areas.
These initiatives were the most successful opportunity.
No one who lives in Malta for at least five years, has the right to purchase a second consumption in the country, and the same constitution is applied for the citizens living abroad.

"Despite strong political support in the test, [the Turkish] government has not revealed a comprehensive and comprehensive political reform programme," the EU 2008 Progress Report said.
The organisation criticised Turkey for restrictions on freedom of expression, pressure on the government on the media, the effect of the military in politics and the lack of progress in respecting cultural diversification and minorities.
The report also voiced disappointment that Turkey has not been pushed for a new constitution that would bring international standards on basic rights.
The EU has criticised the latest controversial laws on certain internet sites in Turkey, saying these laws are "impossible" for the closure and time ".
The organisation also brought the government &aposs pressure on the media on the agenda.
As an example, the EU cited Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to boycott Dodian, the largest media group, the country, after the Justice and Development Party (AKP) reported a major corruption scandal with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish penal code continues to be a problem for the EU, which has a "open insult" for Turkishness ", citing the 301-minute type of crime.

Serbian Orthodox Church Red to Karadzic
One of the death leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church, fugitives Radovan Karadzic, urged the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

"If I have a single question of Radovan Karadzic, this question would continue to live in the lives of a husband, or it would be better to surrender to The Hague," said Stephohije Radovic, a leading members of the Serbian Orthodox Church. [File]
One of the Serbian Orthodox Church (PASOK) leaders, has urged fugitive Radovan Karadzic to surrender to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
"If I have a single question of Radovan Karadzic, this question will not continue to live in the liquidity, or not to go to The Hague," Montenegrin and Litural Metropolitan Director Stephohije Radovic said in an interview Thursday (August 25th).
"If this is determined and I would not want to do so, I cannot want to do so," the Bosnian Serbs told the daily Stephohije, considered Karadzic 'spiritual house. "However, I expect it to decide this decision, as well as the Bosnian Serbs' responsibility for this decision.
I expect it to take the same responsibility and do the right direction. "
The ICTY has charged the former Bosnian Serb leader for more than 10 years ago on his role in the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Karadzic also faces two counts of genocide from the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
Today, Karadzic, who has been frozen over the past eight years, has been widely believed to be hiding in BiH or Montenegro.
In late July, Karadzic called a surprise in front of public opinion.
"I remember all the circumstances and licenses for surrender," Ljiljana Zelen-Karadzic said in an interview with the EP Television on July 28th. "This will be an autonomy for our family."
While noting that Karadzic has created a major pressure on the family of the fugitive, he told the Times that the election would be surrender, even if he was in the same situation.
"I cannot say that I should do, but I can say it.
I would go to The Hague, "he said.
Metropolitan, who was supported by the Karadzic family and the worst, said Karadzic has not been seen since 1995, claiming that the ICTY was hiding in a church in Montenegro.
He also said similar recommendations have made the other Serb commanders who have surrendered to the ICTY recently.
Metropolitan 'remarks followed a report Thursday that Karadzic could surrender in early September, ahead of talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, scheduled to begin in early October.
Authorities quoted Monitor as saying the talks on Karadzic 'surrender have been intensified in recent months, and he wrote that his transfer to the ICTY is prepared to co-operate with Serbian security services.
The extradition of all war crimes indictees wanted by the ICTY is a key condition for Serbia-Montenegro and the other former Yugoslav republics who have been involved in the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s to meet the EU and NATO.

Following the recent attacks by terrorists from the Kurdistan Workers Party, authorities in Ankara launched a new strategy to solve the problem.
During a visit to Diyarbakir earlier this month, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that a solution to the strengthening of democracy.
Meanwhile, the Turkish National Security Council (MGK) met to discuss new measures aimed at condemning the economic development of the Southeast European Anatolian region, a philosophy of conflict with the PKK for 20 years.
According to a report drafted by the MGK secretary General, violence reflects internal divisions in the PKK, where the leaders of the organisation are under way to monitor in the future.
Another reason is seen as a new anti-terrorism law, which is expected to take effect in September.
Thousands of thousands of people were killed as a result of the PKK campaign. Following the capture of President Abdullah Ocalan in 1999, the organisation declared a unilateral ceasefire.
In June 2005, however, it decided to stop the armed fight in the southeastern Turkish population, especially in the majority of the Kurdish population.
The NGOs and some Kurdish intellectuals and some Kurdish intellectuals, who are worried about the resignation of the communities and the governments' resignation of the past days, have called on Ankara to leave a broadcaster.
Former Democratic Party (DEP) lawmakers asked Leyla Zana, Orhan Dohan, Selim Sadak and Hatip Dicle to declare a new Kurdish political movement, led by the PKK.
Meanwhile, the prime minister stressed that the threat of violence could be resolved through reconciliation.
While acknowledging the "Kurdish problem" should be resolved, Turkish nationalists and some opposition politicians have received support from the 15-Kurdish class, 30 companies, 18 companies and Diyarbakir Democracy Platini, which took part in the 15th Kurdish class, which stock criticism from violence.
Regional rights is one of the problems Turkey has to be able to join the EU, which is planning to begin accession talks on 3 October.
The country has already passed some reforms in this direction, including the removal of the broadcasting and education law.
At least a PKK leader seems to respond to these initiatives.
At the same time, a former DEP lawmaker, Zbebejirir Aydar, declared a month declaration and said the latest steps that Ankara was appointed and that the government is a sign of sincerity.

Milic: peacekeeping in this region
In an exclusive interview with Southeast European Times correspondent Srdjan Milic, Socialist Peoples Party leader Srdjan Milic shares Kosovo, NATO, the EU and the future.
By Brian Salin for Southeast European Times in Podgorica -- 03 / 08 / 09
"In the next five years, Southeast European countries will be in Europe," SNP leader Srdjan Milic said. [REF / RL]
Srdjan Milic, leader of the opposition Socialist Party (SNP), told parliament on October 3rd 2008 that Prime Minister Milo Djube was encouraging and psychmarked about the average events that he is the issue of recognition of Kosovo.
"Montenegro can recognise Kosovo a day after Serbia recognises Kosovo," Milic said.
Following a week after the announcement, Montenegro recognised the former Serbian province as an independent country.
The SNP is located to the broad Serbian minority, which creates about 30 per cent of the population -- the broad part of Montenegro.
The SNP, which won 54.55 votes in March 2009, has 16 seats in parliament.
"The Albanian issue in Montenegro has not been closed.
We will wait to wait how the International Court of Justice in The Hague will be, "he said.
Montenegro question NATO membership
The issue on Kosovo status is not the only problem that the country has been faced. In December 14th 2006, Montenegro joined the Partnership for Peace programme, which took one of the first steps towards full membership in NATO. In 1999, there is still a major pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical against the Alliance.
Montenegro protested the country to recognise Kosovo. [File]
"I think Montenegro will join NATO two years ago," Milic said, noting that the campaign for Montenegro is successful to NATO membership. "I think you have fled our flexibility."
Milic says the SNP has yet to discuss NATO membership and that voluntary data will not learn to the party &aposs views on this issue.
However, a survey by the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights (CEDEM) showed that 30 per cent of respondents supported NATO membership, 43.3 per cent opposed to the Alliance and 26.7 per cent have not made any opinion on the issue.
The rates have not changed more than 4 per cent since October 2007, when the CEDEM began to monitor their views on the issue.
Milic says NATO has changed several years in the ten years after a three-month military action against Serbia and Montenegro, which was under state union.
Therefore, efforts to reduce citizens' support for the Alliance membership could not be discovered.
"I do not think that NATO was in 2009 with 1999," the opposition leader said.
The survey by CEDEM shows that a small majority of Montenegro is not the same ideas with Milic.
Participants think that NATO is a "military organisation", 30.6 per cent of them think it is a "military / political organisation" and 21.7 per cent are a political / military organisation.
"I think we have become a world that we are trying to solve the modern modern music problems and have become a battle of NATO and Warsaw Pact," Milic said.
According to Milic, about 50 per cent of Montenegro are not important for defence and NATO relations, and the public should be dealing with this part, "Milic said." This is a matter that must be addressed.
We have to stop and stop our concerns, "he said.
Montenegro hopes for EU membership

Milic ended last week as the head of the National Council for European Integration.
"In the next ten years, Southeast European countries will be in Europe," Milic said, who is convinced that the country could join the Union.
"In 1990, the EU was closed.
Many young and other politicians have had a lot, but the process lost 18-19 years.
Benim was a shift.
I do not want to fear the fans, "he said.
However, Milic believes that Montenegro should not focus on fulfilling EU standards. "If you do you have the owner of this process, I think you have a positive opinion that you have been acceptable in 2011," he said. "I am not positive that we will become a member of the EU."
"Montenegro can create a success in Europe, but we have to ensure the integration of the Montenegrin people and Montenegro before now we can talk about Euro-Atlantic integration," he said.
Regional peace is a step
"How do you think you would be allowed to live with a Albanian," he said.
"You do not say," Milic said. "This is not something that they can know."
"I want to learn a story," he said after a mind.
Following the NATO movement for the Balkans, telephone from a former Albanian friendship in March 23rd 1999.
After a few hours after this telephone, the first bombings will be dropped near the house of Milic.
Milic and his friendship have received economic education in Dubrovnik, Croatia, and his friend lived in Germany for the past nine years, "he said." I can see what will be.
I am volunteer and their children. "
"This spirit is hoping that peacekeeping in this region can be provided," Milic stated.

"The discussions of the national channel (WLE) should be very good, and the first different sides should be closed," Reuters quoted Ahtisaari as saying in an interview with the Fund 'national channel YLE on Monday.
"We have to discuss how these problems can be resolved," he added.
There are many basic jobs that have to be done before a documentary debate can begin. "
Ahtisaari, six, played a key role in international efforts to end the Kosovo conflict in 1999, when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic convinced NATO 'requirements.

The bombing attack on a military bureau in Istanbul on Tuesday (June 22nd), the largest city of Turkey with 13 million people, sparked concerns that the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is now targeted to urban zones.
The "Kurdistan Freedom of the Kurdistan Freedom", believed to be linked to the PKK.
The attack was the last of a series of incidents in particular in the southeastern Anatolian region since late May.
The terrorist organisation ended on May 31st, saying the government does not meet the demands of the Kurdish people, saying it was unilateral fall.
Certainly the controversial amendment of the PKK is now the best response to protecting the public.
On Monday, top civilian and military officials met at a security summit headed by President Abdullah Gul.
The summit ended with the preparation of a tripartite anti-terrorism strategy.
The strategy includes reconstruction of intellectual intellectual intelligence and restructuring military soldiers in the Iraq border, a risk distribution that terrorists from the north of Iraq.
At the same time, military soldiers will be sent to the region only after the intensive education was passed, and they need more troops.
At the same time, specialists are considered the deployment and strengthening military cars.
The strategy also aims to boost co-operation with the United States, which has provided intelligence intelligence in line with neighbouring countries since 2007.
"We are preparing to examine any new request for the Turkish military or the government of the PKK," US Ambassador to Turkey James Jrey said on Monday.
Apart from these measures, Turkey has also made an effort to meet all political parties, as well as NGOs and the media in a united front against terrorism.
"Terrorism is a national problem," said Usta journalist Fikret Bila. "It is a solution for the government and the opposition."
Gul met separate talks with opposition leaders after the death attacks, urging them to find a common basis.
The president will meet with representatives of the state NGOs.
They also work to prevent ethnic conflict after the latest terrorist scandal.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged the media to be responsible for reports.
"Unfortunately, the media supports the terrorist organisation as a conservative or immunity," Erdogan told parliament on Tuesday.
Security expert Nanat Ali Ozdjan said the disappointment of the ethnic ethnic division is the documentary of the PKK strategy.
"The PKK aims to create the identity of terrorism and violence," Ozcan told the daily Zaman on Wednesday. "The process of creating an arbitration is end.
The PKK is trying to strengthen it, but it cannot reach former methods.
If the current situation has turned into ethnic clashes, the identities are always left. "
"The role of the media is very important.
It should not be used, "he added.

The UN said on Wednesday (June 23rd) that global drug use has sparked physical drug drugs, while there is a growing demand for illegal materials in developing countries.
According to the UN Agency for Prosecutor and Supreme Crime (UNODC), 150 to 250 million people in the world were used by 3.5% and 5.7% of the population of 15-64% and 5.7% in 2008.
The agency 2010 World District Report continues to be the most produced and consumption on the world, while the telephysical drugs, such as warnings, are the second drugs used in front of cafe and cafes, the agency said.
"People are at the bottom, and they do not feel more than half of the kidney, but the newspaper writes are trying to use the intense," UNODC head Antonio Maria Costa told reporters on Wednesday, citing the report.
According to the study, at least 130 and 190m people are pushing for at least a year.
The number of abuse users have been estimated to around 30 to 40 million in the world, but the number of computer transactors and clinic users could soon soon be passed.
This trend is also applied for the countries of Southeast Europe (SEE). The highest annual pharmaceutical rate between 15-64 and 6.2% in Croatia was registered at 5.2%.
It was followed by Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Bulgaria, respectively, respectively, respectively.
The highest-ranking drug use in the SEE region was reported in BiH and Bulgaria, where one of the 100 people used the ambitious tress in 2008.
The lowest theory was registered at 0.1% in Albania and Romania, which is based on the most new statistics in 2004 and 2007, respectively.
"These new drugs have a double problem," Costa said. "First, regular normal norms, and the law enforcement agencies are very quick to them.
In the second, the markets are very high, because every situation has been produced to meet certain preferences, "he said.
According to the report, UNODC described the world as "the most serious drug drugs" in the world and is expected to continue.
In 2009, however, it continued to drop by 28% over the past decade, as a large number of Kolombia efforts to reinforce Kolombia.
According to UNODC figures, the world books dropped between 12% and 18% from 2009.
Meanwhile, the market of the drug drug is worth around 88 billion and is losing to Europe.
The case is significant in the countries in Western Africa, the report said.
The number of kidney users in Europe over the past decade has reached approximately 4m euros in the past decade, while the number of world products reached about a quarter of 2008.
North American continues to become the largest market in the world.
However, the European market seems to be almost a bigger, and it is now worth around 34 billion.
"The highest percentage rate in the former" has been destroyed in Suboca (3.9%) and 3% in Britain, Gallery and Italy.

The Serbian electoral commission issued a decision Monday that Belgrade plans to impose UNMIK &aposs objections and organise local elections in Kosovo.

Serbia made clear on Monday (April 14th) that the elections will violate the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and that is why the intention of local elections in Kosovo next month, despite warnings that it would be illegal.
UNMIK chief Joachim Ruecker insists that only the UN has the right to hold elections in Kosovo.
However, Ruecker said Serbia could help organisate organisations in areas where the Serb population in the UN-led elections this year, and acknowledged that Belgrade would have the right to organise parliamentary elections in Kosovo.
"Serbia will hold local elections in Kosovo, the UN Security Council Resolution 1244," he wrote in a letter to Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic, in response to a letter that revealed Belgrade 'plans for elections in Kosovo. "However, the elections will be based on the UN Security Council' Resolution 1244."
Serbian and parliamentary elections will take place on 11 May.
A decision by the Serbian election commission published on Monday included requests for the organisation of local elections in Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia on February 17th.
The commission issued a list of 16 municipalities, including 16 municipalities, will be held for both votes.
Three dozens of countries, mostly EU member states, recognised Kosovo independence, but Serbia does not accept it.
The dispute between the pro-European and nationalist parties in the ruling coalition in Serbia on how to respond to the declaration of independence of Kosovo, caused the government last month to fall the early elections.
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica told Belgrade-based B92 on Monday that the main goal of electoral arrangement in Kosovo is "to legitimate the region as part of UNMIK", as it wants to do.
Meanwhile, Samardzic, a member of the Kostunica Democratic Party of Serbia, urged UNMIK to call for local elections in Kosovo that will be organised by Serbian authorities.
"The UNMIK Security Council violated the Resolution 1244, violating the changes in the summer election regulations, and will not be able to hold local elections in Kosovo," the government quoted Samardzic as saying.
The pressure on Belgrade to hold local elections in Kosovo sparked criticism from ethnic Albanian leaders in Pristina.
Addressing this as an initiative to destabilise the new state of Europe, leaders called on UNMIK to prevent the vote.
"Independent Kosovo is a electoral zone for all citizens," the statement quoted President Fatmir Sejdiu as saying. "It is a responsibility for UNMIK to respond to such initiatives aimed at deepening stability in Kosovo and prevent the institution in implementation."
As UNMIK and KFOR are difficult to block Kosovo Serbs' votes in local elections, international officials say the election results will not be recognised if it is.
UNMIK has not received any response to the Belgrade authorities that Bay Recker was sent to the Belgrade authorities, but that local elections in Kosovo are unacceptable, "the UN mission spokesperson Sven Lesholm Balkan Insight quoted as saying.

Recent increase in food, gasoline and gasoline in Macedonia has begun to the public.
Most of the public say their salaries are not enough to increase prices.
"It is very difficult.
How will it happen if it continues, "he asked.
However, government efforts to control inflation are unsuccessful.
Local economists fear inflation is 10%.
In January, authorities announced the annual inflation rate of 7.8%, and proposed the government to reduce budget expenditures and submit the agricultural sector.
"If you have high inflation in the first quarter of the year and do not take sufficient measures, the 10% inflation could end.
Panic needs and the government should not be able to reduce inflation, "he said.
Most have agreed to increase prices in oil and natural gas prices in the world, but the country must still exercise its effects.
government officials, however, say there is no option for intervention.
"We are doing our best for a market country," Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Stavreski said.
"The current situation has sparked and global climate change.
Today, the paper has increased.
We are talking about the experience of other countries and we will soon take some measures, but this will not happen.
I do not expect to live in serious problems with the discrimination, "he said.
Following last month, Stavreski said the government expects to take a pace of inflation.
"The rise should not exceed 6% by the end of 2008," he told the media.
Only a few months, prices of goods and services were almost 50%, causing the government to increase pensions and salaries in the public sector by 10%.
The National Bank has taken measures to reduce inflation rate.
The Bank has increased interest rates on the treasure to 5.25% from 5.8% to 5.25%, and expects inflation to stop.
The increase in foreign direct investment, which is 240m euros in 2007, has helped bring the economy in order to assist inflation under control.
Stavreski said that only 100m euros are estimated in the first two months of 2008.
Report: Agriculture becomes more priority in BiH
The Federation of BiH, Agriculture, Su Administration and Commander Damir Ljubic said Bosnia and Herzegovina should be one of the main priorities for agriculture.
By Jusuf Ramadanovic for Southeast European Times – 15 / 04 / 08
The agriculture sector has been reviewed over the past five years. [AFP]
The 114 of the 144 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) could be classified as rural, where almost 61% of the people live.
"These demonstrations are sufficient that BiH must decide on a strategic and political decision to be among the top priorities of the agricultural development.
As long as we do not do this, we cannot expect more beautiful days for BiH agriculture, "he said.
Ljubic, who submitted the BiH Agriculture Board report last month in Sarajevo, said that agriculture development is now one of the three main priorities in BiH.
The report, drafted by the Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Ministry (DTEIB), includes main trends in 2005 and 2006 and a general review of agricultural sector, including targets and policy priorities.
The DTEIB is currently in charge of the state level of agriculture ministries and agencies, as well as representatives of the European Commission 'SESMARD Project.
According to BiH Deputy Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Deputy Foreign Trade and Economic Relations Minister Vilim Primac, the agriculture sector has been repeated over the past five years, and the current deficit in the sector has dropped.
"We believe this year will be a turning point, because the country is preparing to join the World Trade Organisation, and we have signed CEFTA and sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
We will be able to open an estimated 6m-euro market, which BiH exports will have a number of opportunities.
However, we have to make our farmers more efficient and competitiveness, "he said.
BiH is more agricultural country, with 15% of its territory, especially by the private sector.
The most rich territory is in the north of the Sava River.
In more mountainous areas, territory and agriculture are used as a whole.
The main innovations are the chapter and explosives.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, tobacco tobacco in more preserved areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The main paper is simple, and swimming is being made.
About 10% of the agricultural sector were damaged during the 1992-1995 conflict.
One of the main obstacles to the restructuring is that the country is still in every part of its territory and other explosive ammunition.
In a assessment of the World Bank, the mechanism could keep up to 10 billion euros, the World Bank said.

Romania has to complete three negotiating chapters under the Environment, Justice and Interior and Reconstruction chapters by the end of the year to sign the Accession Agreement in the first half of 2005 and to become an EU member in 2007.
If they are convinced, Romania is not leaving from the EU chief negotiator Vasile Puscas optimism.
Southeast European Times: The European Commission (EC) described Romania as an effective market economy.
This is only a "diplomatic mission", such as the specialists?
Vasile Puscas: This is not "a diplomatic mission".
We have a way to fulfil all the basic criteria of an effective market economy, as the prices of free inflation rates and macroeconomic stability, and we have achieved all these goals.
In 1997 and 2002, Poland and and Bulgaria have been reviewed by these criteria.
SETimes: There is a warning that the Romanian economy has yet to be able to solve competitiveness in a single European market.
Puscas: With the EU criteria in 1993, transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe were taken into account.
The countries are expected to achieve an effective market economy, and if the Reforms continue to continue, it will have a higher competitive level.
SETimes: Do you think the Romanian economy will achieve its capacity to deal with competitiveness pressure in the future?
Romania hopes to join the EU in 2007. [EU]
Puscas: This is uncertain.
We will have to deal with a broad market, based on our own competitiveness system and our own products, based on our own competitiveness system and our own products.
I want to emphasise this year that Romania could win a member state status in 2007.
SETimes: What can you complete negotiations on the Environment, Justice and Interior and Rekabet issue by the end of the year?
Puscas: For the first time in the Strategy document, the Commission would "show any effort" to complete the negotiations by the end of the year, "the statement said.
So far, the talks have been a joint goal of finding by the end of 2004.
After the talks, the Council of Europe will be completed in December and will assess the issue of the accession issue of Bulgaria and Romania.
SETimes: The latest country report also includes strong criticism on press freedom and corruption.
Do you think these critics are unprecedented?
Puscas: We are not exaggerated.
We must be active because this report is not the chief negotiator or targeted all the Romanian people.
The government must support the necessary measures to ensure media freedom and implement legal regulations.
We must be taken into account and avoid criticism of these criticism, because freedom of expression is widely broad.
SETimes: "Top corruption" was the first time in the Committee report in 2003.
Earlier, it was not used.
Puscas: Corruption issue must be true on the ground.
We are accomplishing such a approach, and the National Team Bureau for Corruption is aware of the importance of the issue.
Corruption is not only a individual or politics.
The competitiveness system in the competitiveness system, earlier, will strengthen the reduction of corruption.
SETimes: You acknowledge that the accession Agreement would be a "security requirement" that allows Romania to delay a year if it does not fulfil its obligations.
The EU, which aims to ensure that reforms are completed after the talks are completed, has been affected by the approval of the requirement?
Puscas: The justice, internal affairs and agriculture has also been implemented as a new member states.
The different practice on Bulgaria and Romania is a security requirement that allows the accession history to be postponed by a year if the consequences of the immigration process are not the beginning.
SETimes: In November, elections will be held.
If the government changed, negotiations and the accession process are affected?
Puscas: We hope that all technical solutions that are the negotiating issue will be finalised by the elections.
In the next period, I hope that the policies should not be in the negotiation process and that the process will move towards natural gas by December.

Romania will not participate in the vote on the UN Security Council decision on US military staff to the International Criminal Tribunal for the International Criminal Tribunal, according to Romanian Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana.
Geoana said the Security Council has decided to be optimistic in Romania, following consultations with foreign ministers and US diplomats, who are not permanent and non-permanent member states.
Romanian Ambassador to the EU, Majnea Motoc, said his country would continue its own stance as a complex international debate.
In 2002, Romania was the first European country to sign a mutual agreement on whether US and US citizens are extradited to the UCM.
The government has been criticised by EU officials, since it signed an agreement on the issue without consulting the European Commission.
While protecting the application of the agreement, the Romanian Parliament has not been linked to the decision or approved.
As a member of a EU candidate country and the United States' strong regional military alliance, Romania has a sensitive position to negotiate between different conditions.
The decision should be implemented and US soldiers need at least nine pieces from US Security Council members to win immunity from the UCM.
The decision was proposed last month and then withdrew.
The United States hopes the decision will be approved before 1 July, when a previous decision on the same issue will be approved.

The first round of the forum was the Government for Southeast Europe.
The economic growth in the past few years is a general privatisation in the region.
Economic reforms have shown improvements in all countries, widely broad or broad.
The amendment in the general airport is encouraging Foreign Investment.
Nevertheless, institutional structure, sustainable growth and the social dependence of the Western Balkans is still a long way.
These issues have created the main mistakes of the conference in Munh: governance, humanitarian development and social integration (infrastructure), the development of the private sector.
In his speech, World Bank President Jim Wolfensohn said that growth could be linked to the development of social and economic issues, and the effects of the public have been unimportant. At the end of the 1990s, it was revealed that the effects on growth strategies are not important.
The framework was revealed during a Municipal conference on social issues.
The opening of Wolfensohn at the Forum, Wolfensohn, was implemented in a region that the visa-based vision is highly high and crime is widely widespread to European standards.
The forum revealed the difference of the conditions in Southeast Europe.

Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania are hoping to become a member of the EU in the process of accession.
Macedonia is also hoping for this issue.
Despite political uncertainty and status problems, Western Balkan countries are acting as general or are believing they will join the EU, as a key security for stability and economic development.
The EU presence in the region is crucial.
This could be assessed for a strategic vision of assistance, economic and trade agreements and labour operations.
Wolfensohn noted that the World Bank in the world has a lot of 5 billion people.
The situation does not mean that the Bank has closed various assistance doors to the region, but Wolfensohn &aposs monitored remarks that Europe does not think itself, and that the EU should take more responsibility in the areas where strategic interests are clear.

However, how to develop development will be made in the private sector discussions on the way for the development of public sector partners in the countries where the income is low, and the private sector partners will not be injured and to encourage SMEs.
The debate on the development of the public and private sector administration showed that high-level policy structures and businessmen know the main challenges are.
In the end, huge, open ideas and the problem should be overcome.
In Southeast Europe, political, institutional and economically, there is a lot of jobs and unconservative.

Although Serbia passed a bill on gender equality last year, the traditional Balkan destruction of the woman, where he is home, is slowly slow.
Nevertheless, Snezana Lakicevic, deputy head of the Council of Insurance and Social Security, says women have more opportunities than a few years ago in Serbian politics.
"We are the prime minister, the prime minister, the justice ministry, and for the first time in our history, there is a woman in the defence ministry," Lakicevic told SETimes.
Lakicevic added that women in the Serbian judiciary are in the highest positions, including the head of the Constitutional Court and the office of the prosecutor.
Lakicevic, a member of the ruling Democratic Party (DS), said men are no longer cautious for women in politics, but that women must fight for their positions in political parties.
"For full equality of the political parties, women still need to be done.
Today we cannot see that every political party in Serbia is a vice-president of the women, "he said.
Serbia has made great progress in implementing gender equality, he said, but it would not be able to see the increase in domestic violence.
The unemployment rate between women and women is more difficult, Lakicevic said, adding that the unemployment rate between women is higher, and the unemployment salaries of women are lower than men.
DS spokesperson and MP Jelena Trivan said the judges are still strong in Serbia.
"We have to be forced, or we cannot be able to learn the construction of key businessmen.
"There is still a judiciary that women are successfully successful," Trivian said. "Women are still unable to do any serious positions, but if they do not have any serious job, there is no serious jobs."
According to Trivian, women in their position are still at least.
"Women are a fair in the party career and the top positions of local authorities.
Despite about 150 municipalities in Serbia, we have only three women 'mayors.
Women are head of the party committees, and the effects are at least if they do not exist, "he said.
Trivian said Serbia has a long way in the fight against the judiciary, despite the legality of gender equality.

Bravo Serbia?

Following four years of waiting, Serbia &aposs EU candidacy was approved last week.
President Boris Tadic, led by President Boris Tadic, agrees that the candidacy status is better life of Serbian citizens, greater investments, new employment opportunities and better living standards.
However, economic analyst Miroslav Zdravkovic believes these expectations are not realistic.
"The EU countries have a decline in extraordinary production -- but the situation is in late 2008 and in the beginning of 2009," Zdravkovic, an analyst for the Makroija website, told SETimes.
Therefore, new business opportunities and investments in Serbia are not realistic, "he said." I do not see any special gain because of the candidacy of Serbia, I did not see any special gain or shifts. "
Many bloggers believe the candidacy is positive.
"As such a success, I fear that Serbia will be the future," B92 quoted him as saying.
Vrki believes that something it has been given to Serbia very long ago.
"Bravo.
Serbia must now be limited and should be directed to the future.
The next step is the start of the talks and should be resolved by many issues.
"I have started with the elections to see how they will do, and then we will continue our road to this point," he said.
However, Denis notes that his candidacy has long been a transition period for full membership, and that other countries in the region are more important than Serbia on European integration.
"If I celebrate the candidacy as a big success: Croatia was a member before it was given a candidate status, Montenegro received a date to start talks, and there is no need to promise with Romania and Bulgaria," he said.
Despite the positive outcome, the ratification process has not been impossible for the country.
In December 2011, Germany blocked Serbia 'candidacy due to the country' withdrawal of relations with Kosovo.
And in early last week, the initiative ended almost the end of Romania due to a group of ethnic Romanians' complaints for behaviour.
This move has shown an effect.
Romania has not made the issue of Vlak during the previous sessions on EU candidacy.
After the talks, Serbian and Romanian officials have reached a sufficient agreement to withdraw the conditions for Belgrade on minorities.
Romanian bloggers have returned to the tender, assessing all of the debate and are trying to give some answers.
"The rights of communities is a internal problem of Romania, what is the problem of Europe?" said Laura Cernnoschi.
"Unfortunately, when it comes to joining the EU, it is a European problem and that it is a European problem, and it was more cautious than all other countries in the region to monitor minority rights," he added.
"I am convinced that Romania is completely in the beginning of the start of Schengen, and the problem is that the Serbs have not been willing to monitor minority rights, even if there is no willingness," Lazy said.
Momo does not participate in the surprise move.
"The Romanian diplomacy, according to the bloggers:" According to the views of the participants, has received some widespread materials, such as the Latin / Crel for a minority, who wants to reinforce itate itself as a true internal domestic war, instead of its efforts to ensure stability.
Romania could always get time after Romania joined the EU for Romanian / Vlak minorities, "he said.

This time, we are against a reality of the Romanian people with their votes, "he said.
"I call on the Romanian Parliament to co-operate in accordance with the votes of the Romanian people."
Basescu took part in a demonstration on Saturday to call Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu to resignate hundreds of supporters, with hundreds of supporters after the referendum.
The referendum was held last month by a alliance founded by five political parties, accusing Basescu of taking the role of the prime minister and violating the constitution for criticism of the courts.
Basescu said the main reason for the conflict with Parliament is to protect the judiciary from political mediator.
He said the constitution would propose a single truck parliamentary council or to prepare the framework for reducing the number of lawmakers to 35% to 40%.
"The Romanian people want to modernise the political class, open party elections lists and revise the constitution of the country," he said on Saturday.
Basescu argues that the priority is in a single vote.
"If the political parties do not go before the end of July, we will face another referendum in the spring of a law that would allow the new parliamentary elections to take effect by the end of 2008, and we will have to elect a single figure," he said.
Basescu submitted a plan that includes 12 parts of a political majority, which is really complicated for "Europe", an independent judiciary, the dismantling of the nature, education system and fulfilling international responsibilities.
The final victory of Basescu, which won, has sparked problems within the parties, but the parties have begun.
The National Liberal Party is considering the Bucharest emergency branch and participate in the opposition.
The Social Democratic Party is urging leaders to take responsibility for a referendum.
"Romanian people have made a second chance to Basescu," Tariceanu said, slowing the importance of the outcome.
Mircea Geoana, head of the Social Democratic Party, said Basescu "won the victory without a victory", because voters participated in a referendum on 50% of the vote.

On March 15th, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn and Montenegrin Prime Minister Zeljko Staranovic have dismissed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA), the first step towards membership.
The agreement is expected to be signed this autumn.
"Our goal is: full membership in NATO and the EU," Vujanovic said.
Opposition leaders have criticised authorities for failing to fulfil their commitments.
"Zaman showed that the public has shown that the things of construction -- poor economic and social standards -- do not achieve improvement," AFP quoted Predrag Bulatovic of the pro-Serbian Socialist People 'Party, as saying.
Milo Djukanovic, who resigned as prime minister in November and resigned as prime minister in November, said Montenegro is the main tasks of the coalition government, which is the party and leader of state institutions.
Montenegro is expected to take the first constitution this year as an independent state.
After months of debate in parliament, the constitution will open a debate in public debate until May 28th.
Still, the document will be presented to the 81 seats in parliament.

Meanwhile, conservative newspaper Buevi also called for reform candidate Musevi to "oppose the areas and instigation".
However, Capeyt, a writer of the Hurriyet newspaper, argued that electoral corruption is not enough to announce the outcome in Iran.
Authorities, however, argue that if they do with the elections, Ahinejad has a solid support of Ahinejad.
"Many observers from the world have predicted that Iran people from the world are not satisfied with the economic situation and support the integration of the Western world," writer quoted him as saying Monday.
"These observers cannot understand the importance of the ideology, particularly the Islamic political ideology," he said.
"No one can change the idea that Ahinejad should not change the idea of a nuclear bombing to the United States, Israel and even to stop the EU.
"The Middle East is ready to play more time," he wrote, a columnist with the West.

The decision came, "he said. [Getty Images]
Croatian and Slovenian foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on the long-standing border dispute between their countries in Luxembourg on Monday (June 15th).
"Today we did not find a solution and we decided to continue our talks," Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic said after the meeting.
Talks focused on the latest solution to the dispute, which the two countries declared independence from the former Yugoslavia by 1991.
The dispute between the two Adriatic countries and the Mediterranean borders is an important obstacle to Croatia &aposs progress in the EU integration process.
Slovenia, which joined the Union in 2004, has been blocking the opening of new chapters between Croatia and Brussels since December 2008.
The country threatened to block the process without resolving the border dispute.
Analysts have warned that the stalemate could jeopardise the chance of completing accession talks as planned by the end of this year. The Balkan country, which hopes to join the Union by 2011, is hoping to join the Union by 2011, has closed only seven of the 33 negotiating chapters so far.
In an effort to end the stalemate, Rehn proposed an agreement that envisions the establishment of a special international arbitration court in April to resolve the disagreements.
Croatia, which described it as "a bidder", accepted the proposal.
However, politicians in Slovenia have not been satisfied with the plan, saying their countries are not recognised as an open sea country and could block direct access to international transportations in the north of the Adriatic.
In May, Slovenia submitted proposals for Rehn 'offer.
Slovenian Prime Minister Borut Pahor described the amendments as "very important" in terms of the interests of his country, warning that Ljubljana could not reject the proposal if they do not happen.
On Monday, Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said he was among some of the recommendations sent in Brussels last month.
"Now we have to see the proposal and discuss the government and parliament," he told reporters after a meeting in Luxembourg.
Rehn said on Thursday and Friday that a solution should be reached before the two-day EU summit in Brussels.
Following a new meeting Wednesday, he said, the two ministries will be held in their countries.
"We could produce more, but we are working very detailed," the DPA quoted Rehn as saying.
Pahor told reporters in Ljubljana that the plan is "satisfied with the new tender", saying the plan is approaching both countries to reflect national interests.
"This could be prepared for a clear solution that will determine the common border," the AFP quoted the Slovenian prime minister as saying.

Serbia hopes to enter the EU "White Schengen" list, the EU foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg on Monday (June 15th).
The ministers gave the green light for the European Commission (EC) plans to remove visa requirements for countries that meet the requirements this year.
Earlier this month, European Commission Enlargement Commissioner Jacques Barrot said Serbia and the two other Western Balkan countries are candidate.
While Serbia and its neighbour have completed most of the criteria for Montenegro, Barrot said, Macedonia has fulfilled all.
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic told reporters that Serbia will work "to implement all technical and other conditions" for the removal of the visa regime in the autumn.
"We have passed a very important and successful day in our European integration," the daily Blic quoted Celic as saying. "For the first time, we can say that there is no serious technical work between us and the Schengen.
There is no political condition or decision. "
The government has made very important for the process.
Last year, Djelic pledged a election that the visa regime would be removed if the Democratic Party (DP) is elected.
Voters gave a new task to the DP, and now they are waiting to see the party will keep its promise.
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, one of the small member of the ruling coalition, was more cautious.
Dacic said he expects the visas to be removed next year and warned that the process should not be removed.
"I think that the actions of entering the White Schengen List are less important than progress in this process," Dacic said, adding that Serbia would have to work very difficult to ensure the removal of restrictions.
He also stressed that all EU member states must accept the EC proposal.
The EC cited preparations for removing the three countries' visa liberalisation and rating between 1 and 3 to 3.
Macedonia won the highest score, while Serbia and Montenegro ranked 1.7 points.
The decline of Serbia &aposs score is reportedly restricted by Serbs living in Kosovo and Republika Srpska in the passport distribution of Serbs living in the Republika Srpska.
Serbia is also pushing for the removal of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, as well as a trade agreement on visa rules.
Both months have been suspended due to Belgrade &aposs failure to extradite war crimes indictees Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic.
UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz briefed EU foreign ministers during a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday.
Brammertz praised Serbia for co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, but said it is much more to be done.
The Netherlands, together with Belgium, opposes the continuation of the SAA process until all requirements are met.
Dutch Foreign Minister Maxim Verhagen is important that his country is ready to step down on the trade agreement.
According to the ministry, the Netherlands will not lead to pressure on the trade agreement or SAA, although the visa restrictions will accept the removal of visa restrictions.
The Council of Europe will focus on the issue at the summit on Thursday and Friday.

Hundreds of young people in Montenegro
While human resources are one of the biggest assets in Montenegro, young and young education are forced to find jobs in the country.
The business is based on what they are "extradited" from the skills and academic structures, but many students are able to get business applications.
Even though the residents from the coastal coast, they are trying to enter the market, and some have the chance to find a business in different areas where they can use their skills at least.
They are increasingly abroad, with the "mind" immigration "from consumption to the economic potential of the country.

Most young people in Montenegro have to find jobs. [UNICEF]
It is something that has been seen in the world, or to apply for a referendum.
In smaller economies such as Montenegro, the situation is more clear.
Dragana, who has been in the economic part of the University of Podgorica earlier, says there is no job because there is no recognition in the positions, but no information and experience is not a job.
The lawsuit faculty, Zoran, is the same situation. It is not an average, and there is no job in the field of specialised specialised in a legal firm, when it comes to the barricades and state class.
Many business applications have not been accepted.
Several stories between universities in Montenegro are possible.
Following the most complicated job for education, encouraging discrimination and unfair competitiveness, the chances of abroad are on the way to supervise their chances.
The areas are clearing different ways.
They are trying to prove themselves, but will work in their own areas -- the new political situation in Montenegro -- will improve conditions in the business market.
There is no way from abroad, but other parts in the country have no hope for business opportunities are losing to other business areas.
The most cheaper can agree with specialised expert and salary, and the majority of the group is working for foreign companies.
Some are continuing to live in academic work to live in order to live the job, and as long as it is possible, the families of their families.
According to Montenegrin Statistics Agency (MONAT) data, the number of workers can work within the population of 630.58 countries in 2004, the number of business owners can be active in the population of 259.92, the number of jobs (187.33 per cent), 71,759 per cent (27.7 per cent) could not work.
The rest of the population is around 15.
A career fair was held in Montenegro for the first time in its contributions to the Podgorica University. [Podgorica University]
Another reason for the lack of unemployment rate is high, but there is no business opportunities for the business opportunities.
Most of the companies do not work in effect of human resources, and the situation is more poor.
In recent months, work on young and training sectors have been made in order to revive the business market.
In the beginning of this year, the economic part of the Podgorica University, for instance, international student union AISEC and the Montenegrin Business Agency organised the first career fair in the country.
The fair, named by the Chief of Telecom Group, Open 'Bank, Gorenje, Customs Customs, Montenegro' Central Bank, Hipotevna Bank, Procle & Gamble and Deloitte, attended the fair.
"Gelin, the fair, a permanent slog, such as Gorin, Business", was visited by students that continue to continue young professionals, new irregularities and literature education.
The aim of the fair is to comply with companies who want to meet the needs of human resources and create a database of potential employees in participating companies.
The Telecom Group, which will replace the market, financial and sale sectors, has the most visitors.
Meanwhile, Montenegro Stars Group announced on July 13th that it will pay 700 people to work in Hotel Splenda.
A number of personnel need to sell sales and market executives from the hotels, and there are many personnel in English and Germany.
In particular, Deloitte is 10 people who are not able to travel with the average of economic education and have not been able to obtain a high average, but in particular English and computer (Excel).
Procter & Gamble wants to reviews with the English and computer in various areas.
The Montenegrin Business Agency is working to improve conditions in the business market.
The institution promoted the latest project of a "Youth Storm" in the fair.
As part of the project, however, it is offering business image to stays.
For the rest of the business experience, 80 per cent of the bronze salaries will be met by the Council.
The development of human resources is among the targets of EU assistance to Montenegro.
As part of efforts to support public administration reform, the European Agency for Reconstruction has backed the Montenegrin Business Assembly on implementing legislation on the establishment of a professional career career system for public services.
Such events, such as the career Year, are the potential to block the immigration of the young population in Montenegro and avoid a major obstacle to economic development.
However, all of the jobs have been convinced.
Milica, a student of English-language, has the persons who have already promised the business opportunities that participated in the fair, but "everyone is open", says.
Nevertheless, the necessary skills, excellent training and professional professionals do not have a recognition.
It will continue to be the only realistic solution for young people to go abroad.
Milosevic Says for Political Cinauguration
Slobodan Milosevic was charged on Tuesday (September 23rd) with the murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic and leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, Vuk Draskovic.
(RFE / RL, Bloomberg, Tanjug - 24 / 09 / 03; AFP, Reuters, BBC, UPI, Radio B92 - 23 / 09 / 03)
Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who is in front of judges and war crimes in The Hague, has now faced charges in his country because of his role in political violence against political opponents.
Serbian special prosecutor Jovan Prijic, who published the indictment on Tuesday (September 23rd), said Milosevic was charged with the murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic and the murder of Serbian Renewal Movement leader Vuk Draskovic.

Earlier this year, Stambolic was killed by Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in the north of Serbia, following broad operations against organised crime on March 12th. The president of Serbia between 1987 and 1987 was expected to be the most powerful victory in the October 2000 presidential elections.
In a statement earlier, Serbian police said that Stambolic was linked to the Milosevic regime, which is currently five members of a special police unit currently disbanded.
Milosevic, meanwhile, claimed Stambolic had not seen as a threat to the political career, claiming that he was murdered.
"Ivan Stambolic is not an important person … he was not a politically unfortunately," the AFP quoted him as saying in a letter to Milosevic 'letter to a prison in The Hague last month.
Two months ago, Draskovic was dismissed by Stambolic, and was transferred from the attempt to murder in Budva.
Earlier in the previous incident in October 1999, the leader of the experienced opposition, failed to establish a car explosion in a car explosion that four were killed.
Local media reported on Tuesday that the perpetrators were Milosevic, in their decision to target Stambolic and Draskovic.
The indictment also includes four other people, including former special police commander Milorad Lukovic, who was known as the "Legion".
Lukovic, the top suspect of the Djindjic murder, is still at large.
Other three are State Security chief Radomir Markovic and his deputy, Milorad Bracanovic and former Army Chief of General Staff Nebojsa Pavkovic.
Prijic said that with the indictment, interim documents would present the Belgrade regional court on Wednesday.
The court will then launch the judiciary procedure.
Among those were the names of Milosevic, Mirjana Markovic, who is believed to have a massive role in the murder of Stambolic.
Following months ago, police arrested Markovic on the murder.
Markovic is still believed to be hiding in Russia.
The Special court was formed in particular to discuss terrorism and organised crime cases after Djindjic was appointed.
According to Belgrade-based Radio B92, Prijic announced on Wednesday that he plans to release three other claims linked to organised crime in mid-October.

Milososki praised the UN Security Council on Saturday for "restrictive measures against Libya" and unanimous unity ".
The sanctions, which consists Gaddafi and close to 15 people from the close environment, are supported by members of the 15-nation Council in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which are not a permanent member of the 15-nation Council.
In a meeting on Saturday, BiH representative to the UN, Ivan Barlic, said the delegation had found "fear of violence against civilians in Libya", calling for an emergency action to end mines in the country.

On Monday, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Romania and other 23 EU member states adopted a decision by the Security Council at the weekend to the Gaddafi regime, which has been announced by the Security Council.
Serbia announced on Wednesday that all military and economic co-operation between Libya and economic co-operation were suspended.
Voicing concern about the situation, Defence Minister Dragan Sutanovac said Serbian Army members or retired military personnel were allegedly involved in attacks against the Gaddafi regime.
"We do not take part in any way," Sutanovac said. "There is no only pilot or another army, especially in military activities in Libya."
Labour Minister Rasim Ljajic told reporters that his country has condemned all forms of human rights violations, adding that Serbian authorities have provided the right balance on the issue.
Turkey is the only Southeast European country that expressed its stance against UN sanctions for Libya, while Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan argued restrictions would harm the people of Libya 'leaders.
Meanwhile, Gaddafi warned on Wednesday that he was not planning to leave the post.

Opposition demonstrations continue in Zagreb on Wednesday (March 2nd), while the European Commission (EC) published an interim progress report on Croatia ’ s EU membership.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule said there are proposals for further reforms in this field before the negotiating chapter on the judiciary is closed.
Although the EC acknowledged that authorities in Zagreb have made progress in judicial reforms, the EC says more efforts must be spent in order to ensure success in the fight against corruption.
The rally, organised by a Facebook group, began last week in an effort to protest the country ’ s economic situation and corruption.
According to their sources, the group has been changing between 2,000 and 5,000, and Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor has invited the government to resign.
On Wednesday, the group was on the city of Zagreb, and the two largest parties in Croatia, the ruling HDZ and the opposition SDP, later dismissed the flags of the SDP.
The crowd met in front of the agency, where Kosor was headed, and invited the prime minister to resign.
A small-smaller protests were held in other cities.
"We want," Marko, a protester told SETimes. "I want to live with the salary … I want to go abroad for my future.
"I want to stay in the case, I want to focus on the needs of this country," he said.
"If these businessmen do not know how to solve this situation, they will go at least and offer them another job," said Marina, a student from Zagreb.
Following the group, the posters expressed their message that politicians do not serve the public, but are charged with poverty and abuse the economy.
Earlier this week, Kosor said that these demonstrations could jeopardise Croatia ’ s EU membership.
At the same time, the EC said, the government has made full progress in refugees and full co-operation with The Hague war crimes tribunal.
The country can close the chapter on judicial and fundamental rights, he said.
In general, local authorities must speed up efforts to complete accession talks by the end of June, the interim report said.

In Pristina, students were unaware of the victims, while Kosovo leaders condemned the armed conflict that killed two US soldiers at Frankt Airport on Wednesday (March 2nd) and killed two soldiers.
Arid Uka, 21-year-old Arid Uka, reportedly worked at the Frankt Airport, allegedly opened a bureau.
German prosecutors say the attack could have been researching radical Islamic Islam as a possible reason, while media reports reported that Uka could have taken religious slogans before the attack.
Authorities say Uka is in the village of Zabar, near Mitrovica.
Kosovo President Behgjet Pacolli expressed "deepening" over the incident, and American people, the army, authorities and victims said they were convincing their families.
"The people of Kosovo have condemned this fect, which has taken a key role in the establishment of Kosovo, has been condemned by soldiers who played a key role in preserving security and stability in the world," Pacolli said in a press release.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci and his cabinet also expressed similar concerns.
"This fears is an active action against the United States, freedom of movement and the US government of American people, both for independence and the development of Kosovo, and for strong support for the people of Kosovo in its integration," the official said in a statement.
"One of such action is that Kosovo citizens are convicted," Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj, who attended students at the University of Pristina in front of the central National Theatre, said. "There is no way to represent them."
The Koha Movement, a youth movement of Mitrovica, organised a rally in the city and condemned the incident.
"We condemn this criminal action as Kosovo citizens and Kosovo young people.
This is not reflected by our people, "he said.
Observers between the public have been worried.
"I am a man," Menhanr, a young Menhanr in Pristina, told SETimes.
"For us, it was very bad for our image," said Artana, the young anne who wrote with children in the capital.
In Washington, meanwhile, President Barack Obama said he was "beautiful and frequent" for the attack.
"I want everyone to understand that this phenomenon will be done and we will not make any effort to ensure that all perpetrators are working with German authorities, and to ensure that all perpetrators are brought to justice," he said.

The government is still seeking to implement the austerity measures agreed with the EU and the IMF, which is still created in public opinion.
Most of the Greek people say the price of economic recovery is impossible.
On February 23rd, the public was explosive in the largest strike since December 23rd 2009.
The majority of public service has been sparked, frozen flights to the country have stopped and hotels were closed due to the threat of violence in central Athens.
The refineries also participated in major facilities such as the refineries, terminals, port factories and the Coca Cola factory.
"There is no doubt that this [was] worse than the disease," said Yiannis Panagopoulos, leader of the Greek National Committee for Studies. "It is more rich, poor.
This cannot continue. "
A Greek Central Bank analyst who does not want to announce his name, says that "data" can only be successful if everyone contributed to power.
"There is no protests that threaten the stability of the country. [The] society] convicted [unconvicted] discrimination," he said.
"The Greeks have been clearly produced and therefore the revenue is reduced.
Will people strike and lose a daily house?
I think that a day of my house can be reviewed, but if the economic programme can give them a decline, it is possible because they have contributed to the power, "he said.
According to political observer Yiannis Mihaletos, the strikes are more tolerance.
"Greek unions have been imposed to the party for several years, and they have been imposed by the Greek political parties," Mihaletos told SETimes. "People are now able to create any concept for the current economic situation, ensuring that people have already been finalised by the existing economic situation, and enabled to any political forces."
After some protesters, salaries and pension cuts, shifts and pension cuts, cuts, public sector cuts and executive contract, there is no longer nothing to lose today, some protesters said.
"I am working 35 years and I contributed to the sector by paying taxes and pension funds," said George So, 55-year-old owner of a private company.
"Now, we are now unable to fulfil the obligations of the pension funds, but the front of the fans say it is not a mistake.
How is the future of all children, not only for me, but the future of Greek families?
I see any future, and I am not the only person who think it is not. "

Two people were killed and 11 were injured, according to a official in Pristina on Monday (September 24th), hours after a strong explosive explosion in Pristina.
"Some cafes and restaurants are still in a commercial area where they are still working," Kosovo Police Service (KPS) spokesperson Veton Stefani told reporters.
The fifth explosive explosion showed a part of the two high-ranking business centres in Dardania symbolished in the Pristina Bill Clinton Exchange, while vehicles and other buildings were damaged.
Instead of the photographs, the diseases and archaeological sites are seen.
According to him, the victims are believed to have a cafe near the victims.
One of the incidents was killed in the hospital where others were removed.
The KPS, which also attended KFOR soldiers, has been investigating the region and investigated, but details about the typical and amount of explosives were not discovered.
According to reports, the explosion was held near the cafe, which was explosive.
The owners, believed to be members of a local school, are suspected of involvement in the murder of a key police officer in late August.
Authorities condemned the incident said there was no evidence that would link the international community, which continues to continue talks on Kosovo &aposs final status.
"There is no signal that the battle shows that there is any relationship with the political process of Kosovo," the AFP quoted government spokesman Avni Arifi as saying on Monday. "The government is determined to fight any crimes and create a huge environment."
The move came a few days after Serbian and Kosovo Albanian leaders will hold direct talks on Friday, including the UN General Assembly in New York.
The negotiation process has been stalled for months, and reconciliation prospects are weakened.
At a time when Kosovo Albanians are increasingly condemning a compromise, the province administration threatened to declare independence on December 10th.
Belgrade, meanwhile, remains against independence and has offered broad autonomy as alternative.
"Our offer is broad autonomy," said Goran Bogdanovic, a member of the Belgrade negotiating team, in an interview. "This means the establishment of a Kosovo state or a state."
Judiciary reform and political dialogue are viewed as key to Macedonia ’ s NATO bid
NATO officials said Macedonia has been affected by the progress made in defence reforms and its prospects for membership in NATO are now dependent on the country &aposs politicians.

NATO wants to send Macedonia at the summit in Bucharest next year, but the country must offer more results.
Recently, the Alliance &aposs decision in Brussels was the autonomy of messages.
A delegation from Macedonia arrived in Brussels this month to present the country &aposs annual programme for NATO membership.
According to sources from the Macedonian delegation, most of the representatives of the NATO Political Committee voiced hope that this new national programme would be the last.
NATO has signaled that new subsidies will be sent in Bucharest, and three Adriatic Charter countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- are seen as the most serious candidates.
However, there are jobs Macedonia must do.
According to Nikola Dimitrov, the national co-ordinator for Euro-Atlantic integration, authorities in Brussels said the judiciary reform should be a part of special interest.
Mesaj was the completion of the Judiciary Council and the prosecution Office must be passed by reform laws.
NATO is also seeking better political dialogue with the government, the presidency and opposition co-operation.
The removal of political obstacles that have sparked judicial reform must be removed.
The Macedonian Army (ARM) and defence affairs are better.
The Macedonian Army has contributed to missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The ARM has been completely professionalised and has been implemented in implementing a programme aimed at bringing smaller, rich and efficient army, which could deal with new asymmetric threats, such as terrorism.
Last week, NATO Military Committee President General Ray Henault met with senior officials in Skopje.
After talks with ARM Chief of General Staff Miroslav Stojanovski, Henault said the delegation has affected progress in military reforms.
Henault said that the Republic of Macedonia has been very good candidate so far, but the political level will be made when all NATO membership are considered.
"My expectation is our support for full membership in the Alliance.
"The motivation and obligation of the ARM members is the consensus on NATO membership between political parties in Macedonia, as well as a major support from the people," he said.
Greek leader Karamanlis determined to resume agenda

Instead, the majority of the parliamentary majority appeared to be reduced.

Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, the leader of the New Democracy party, who failed to keep at least a different majority in the early elections on September 16th, said he expects a consequence of several new cities.
Although Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis and other key members remain in their duties, the other ministries have been changed in order to gain a new cycle and gain public support.
"I will monitor the interior minister," Karamanlis said.
After that, he also warned that the prime ministers need direct approach to examine the public.
"Several television, many announces are very serious to pay too much.
It is a and it is necessary, "he said.
Although the party &aposs power declined in parliament, Karamanlis stressed the commitment to continue the agenda.
The initiatives aimed at reducing the budget and reducing costs have faced unions and the left opposition, and Karamanlis hoped the elections would provide more support from the public.
Instead, the New Democracy was a more weakened government from the voters who are now in the way.
Most analysts have dismissed their prospects for change.
"The electoral campaign has made it clear that the parties are not willing to avoid uncertain defendants," the daily Kathimerini said. "Both New Democracy and the left New Democracy, PASOK, said they are planning to make a clear market for the young people, while they are going to create a more fair market for their salaries," he said
According to the International Transparency Organisation, corruption is one of the main areas that the government will have to make progress.
The prime minister must regain the reputation of a recent pension fund of New Democracy due to the scandal.
Many state pension funds, banks and commissioner companies could face charges of human scandal, broadcasting and tax evasion.
Following the disappointment in August, many expect the Karamanlis administration to see whether it will be moved to close the details that encourage the commissioners to cover the law.
In the past, the fans were always the news of new construction.
However, with the unprecedented disease this time, the public is not in accordance with tolerance of the spirit trade.
Karamanlis, 51, has called for early elections in August, before the government &aposs mandate is completed.
Now his party has 152 seats in the 300-seat parliament since 2004.
According to Economy Minister George Alogoskoufis, the government is ready to prepare the 2008 emergency budget.
In the next time, the EU '4th Society Support Support Charter is the adoption of a bill on the use of investment subsidies.
Alogosfis told reporters that the first bill to parliament would be on fighting tax evasion.
The government also said he wants to take steps to remove taxes from the first bureau.

Some society opened, but the electoral and development opened.
This is the reason for the completion of the Democratic Christian Party (DHSS) proposal to be completed by similar experts and politicians.
The bill, submitted by the DHSS, envisions the establishment of a special national agency that will open the parties' intellectuals, which are earlier by the state security and other state services.
According to DHSS Chairman and Justice Minister Vladan Batic, the law will recognise the procedure for the private situation playing a role in the third persons.
"There is no problem with the opening of the party," said Democratic Alternal Secretary-General Igor Jovicic, who said Batic showed that the actions of the law shows that the accusations of the law shows that the secret police were slated.
Batic refused to see any dynamic.
"The issue is not wrong.
A cleaning and we want to reiterate certain people who have served in state agencies in the past.
We want us to be detained by all things.
Some people in the DOS have been named, and they should be revealed if they are convinced, then they should be able to have a concept for the state, "he said.
Democratic Alternal and Democratic Central Bank have expressed dissatisfaction with Batic 'recommendation as justice minister, not the DHSS leader.

Croatia has been convinced since a bilateral solution, while EU member Slovenia wants the issue to be resolved through Zagreb 'EU accession talks.
Slovenia 'team was a air traffic, such as bilateral relations.
Croatia hoped to open ten new negotiating chapters and close five witnesses in order to produce a limited pace in the talks.
Slovenia, however, feared that Croatia has made the issue of controversial borders.
Slovenian Foreign Minister Samuel Zbogar said in Ljubljana on Friday (December 19th) that the EU should be represented "and that the member states must be able to notify their interests, they are trying to achieve consequences in enlargement".
Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Jandrokovic promised that Zagreb would resolve the issue.
Croatia, which began its accession talks with the EU in October 2005, has opened 22 of the 35 chapters now and closed its own.
The EC expressed regret that Slovenia has announced.
"I want to be hiding," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said.

Febook groups, who called on the other country to boycott their goods, have already been simply such as Facebook groups.
Slovenia is the fourth country to purchase exports of Croatia, while Croatia is the third largest of Slovenian exports.
Nevertheless, Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said a pressure to boycott Slovenia is "unacceptable".

The public in Macedonia, which shows economic improvements, is expected to be better life
The rise investment rating seems to be positive on a growing GDP, a stable macroeconomic policy and low inflation rates in Macedonia, as well as economic conditions in Macedonia.
But these developments reflect the quality of life in the street.
The demonstrations are positive, but foreign investment is still insufficient, insufficient costs and unemployment.
The government of Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski is a priority for the improvement of the economy, which they have been pushing for difficult reforms and the foundations of a prosperous future.
As the Macedonian citizens want to see concrete benefits of developments, the government is increasing pressure on the government, calling for citizens to be pushed.

The surveys suggest the problem that Macedonian citizens are most concerned. [AFP]
Many Macedonians say there are no improvement in the quality of their daily life.
In the country where the new employment rate is low, gasoline, electricity and telephone fees are sold, while salaries do not increase.
The question of the most concerned by Macedonian citizens shows that the economic situation and unemployment is the poverty, the surveyed polls show.
Nevertheless, economic demonstrations have shown that the country has come from a long transition period, shows the economy has come to the economy.
According to the finance ministry, growth is the necessary economic basis for improving living standards.
At the end of August, Standard & Poor &aposs upgraded the long-term investment rating of Macedonia from BB to BB on foreign currency, while local currency currency units from BB to BBB.
Meanwhile, the short-term investment rating from the local currency was dropped to A-3.
According to the rating company, "demonstrations show stability."
First and determined progress towards political stability and fulfilling the requirements for the Ohrid Agreement are important to play a role in the rating of the country.
Construction reforms, macroeconomic stability, stable foreign currency, market debts and other key factors have been shown.
Standard & Poor also noted that efforts to regulate administrative practices, liberalisation of the labour market and reform of the judiciary.
Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski has revealed the results of Macedonia.
"This year the GDP will increase by about 4 per cent this year, which will be a good basis for economic development for the next period," Buckovski said in a statement at the Citime centre in London.
Meanwhile, optimistic estimates from the IMF.
The IMF, the latest report on World Economic Studies published in the past two years, suggests that the Macedonian economy will increase by 3.8 per cent this year and 3.7 per cent in 2006.
The IMF expects the growth rate for 2005 and 2006 to be seen in the world economy, with 4.3 per cent.
"This year the GDP will increase by about 4 per cent, and this will be a good basis for economic development in the coming period," Macedonian Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski said. [AFP]
According to the report, the country &aposs payments balance deficit was 6.5 per cent of GDP this year, while in 2006, 5.2 per cent will be needed to 5.2 per cent.
The IMF predicts that Macedonia will close to 1.2 per cent inflation this year, and inflation rate in 2006 will be up to 1.8 per cent.
Nevertheless, the national revenue in the country will be 2.380 this year and 2508 next year, according to the IMF estimates.
Another positive indication was the country &aposs UN Humanitarian Development report, and the report ranked 59th among the 117 countries in terms of GDP, education and health care.
Index shows a trend in these areas over the past five years.
It is not a general improvement of citizens who reflect the standard of living.
According to the USAID, one of the reasons is the rest of Macedonia for technical developments.
More than 250 to 600 people in many countries use Internet, while in Macedonia is 60.
Another effect, experts say, the bureaucracy has to have a job.
More than 13 procedures, 48 days of waiting, and an estimated 12.350 costs for the business.
Macedonia is the lowest foreign investment rate in the region with 2160m.
The government is taking steps to resolve the problem. As of January 1st 2006, all the measures will be able to transfer a system that could be done at the only point.
Three of the 18 amendments to the process have already been taken into effect.
Authorities say local and foreign investors have entered a way to attract more easier to the country.

The World Bank, which has ranked 123th to Macedonia in terms of labour and labour procedures, is among the obstacles that the country is not the labour market.
Instead, Macedonian citizens are working without fear that their chances may have the job, but it is very low.
Macedonia is 53, in terms of credit procedures, and the World Bank is 30th in terms of protecting business taxes and the protection of investors' rights.
The 81st country, Bulgaria (62nd) and Romania (78th) remain in place, while Serbia-Montenegro (92nd), Albania (117) and Croatia (118) left.
The Macedonian citizens are now taking the benefits of these progress in the economic performance.
The finance ministry says the basic foundations for a prosperous future are being implemented.
In the first three years after the government was in office, Buckovski suggested that the previous governments and the previous governments have revealed the losses of ethnic conflicts that enabled the country to almost part of the territory.
The government, which holds a financial policy monitoring and advises the IMF and World Bank proposals, believes the investment climate could solve the unemployment problem.
Buckovski hopes that if a foreign bank can attract at least one foreign banks, loan interest rates will be reduced and will increase domestic investments.
On the other hand, local exporters complain high interest rates from possible exports to the euro, and citizens are deepening the alcohol power.
The government of Buckovski has made difficult reforms in line with a better future of a more active economy and so far.
Government officials say this is time to reflect citizens' life.

pro-pro-communist politicians block Bosnia and Herzegovina EU accession process
The calls for strengthening state institutions have been sparked by Republika Srpska Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, a federal solution for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo – 17 / 09 / 07

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which has a complex government structure, faces a serious slowdown problem in recent months.
The election campaign last year was returned to nationalist rhetoric rhetoric and continues to complete political environment.
The EU says it is clear that the country is able to make progress on the integration of state institutions is based on significant reforms aimed at strengthening state institutions.
The current state structure of three national and two sides is a result of the Dayton Agreement, which ended the four-year conflict in 1995.
The Dayton Accord has ended the violence, but many observers think the political system, created with the agreement, is complex, inefficient, expensive and life with EU standards.
However, the political will to change this system seems to be power.
Though those responsible for this stalemate, observers agree that both sides are the biggest share of Republika Srpska (RS) Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, who won a major victory in the current climate. Dodik, the leader of the Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) in 2006, argued that the Bosnian Serb entity is also strengthening the disaster of the Bosnian Serb entity.
"The only concern is RS.
For me, BiH is a structure that is created by the Dayton Agreement.
I respect the agreement, "Dodik said in another speech, describing BiH as" a phenomenon that has blocked RS development ".
Local and foreign politicians have criticised Dodik for trying to gain a free state status of Bosnian Serb entity.
During the electoral campaign, Bosniak politicians called for RS to be taken.
Dodik criticised these calls for a independence referendum.
RS senior officials and representatives of the Bosnian Serb entity in the BiH Parliament have cautioned that in recent years, the representatives of the Bosnian Serb entity could require the extradition of all powers who have been transferred to the state.
Reforms say the current police system has ordered the criminals to escape entity borders. [Getty Images]
According to RS President Milan Jelic, "If the requests for RS 'extradition, we are not asked to extradite our authority on the Supreme Judiciary and Prosecutor Council," RS President Milan Jelic said.
Dodik and SNSD argues that BiH will be a federal unit of the RS, as a federal unit, the federal state structure is not based on the central administration.
Dodik claims that Bosniaks will be judge if the country is a single electoral unit of the country, as a simple and most prominent democracy approach is impossible.
Dodik, one of the broad local trade relations network, believes the economy is the most important factor for the future of the Bosnian Serb entity.
Dodik, who arrived in Laktasi, near Banja Luka in March 1959, was not from the University of Belgrade Political Science Foundation. In 1986-1990, Laktasi Mayor served as a representative at the RS National Assembly.
The ruling Democratic Party of Serbia (SDS), the only political opposition to the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), has established the Group for Independent Parliament, the only political opposition.
The group, which has been headed by Dodik, has created the current party to withdraw. In 1997, the RS National Assembly was elected.
In January 1998, RS President Biljana Plavsic nominated Dodik as prime minister.
The cabinet of Dodik was in office until January 2001.
Dodik, who is focusing on strengthening the political party, has also criticised the SDS as a strong criticism.
Dodik also attracted itself as an interim alternative to nationalist conservative conservatives.
Dodik, whose party won the elections in February 2006, promised that RS would protect its presence.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the EU is not possible to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina, without an agreement on a police reform in accordance with the EU. [Getty Images]
"In 1996, Dodik [war crimes indictee Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic] were one of the politics that said Karadzic and Ratko Mladic must hand over to the UN war crimes tribunal.
However, the pragmatian is one of a political approach, when it comes to a political climate and one businessman has been involved in a major support of him, "he said.
According to Topic, the restructuring of nationalist rhetoric has many reasons.
One of them is that fundamental ideas have not changed.
According to Topic, RS citizens have been training for years, as a political and politically, the Bosnian Serb entity is a state.
Topic also believes the international community has not failed to convince Bosnian Serbs that the existence of the current structure is very high and that the money, which is spent in this huge administrative structure, could be more beneficial to social programmes, such as social programmes.
One of the factors that have spent the idea of independence in RS, Topic said, is debate over Kosovo 'status, adding that Serbian policies use RS for obstacles to gain independence.
In terms of the citizens of both sides, the price of the incidents is that BiH has lost here in the EU.
Police reform is the most important precondition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, which is still possible this year.
However, the reform has been held for a long time due to Dodik &aposs failure to protect police powers at the entity level.
In addition, RS representatives oppose NATO requests to keep the Civil Protection Administration at the state level.
"BiH has been tightened and stopped between two rebels that have excluded each other on the constitution.
One of the concept is that the entities are completely completely completely, and other RS continues to continue its presence.
It is difficult to find a solution and so far, the international community has been in a complex stance, "he said.
According to Topic, the international community has to show a solid stalemate, showing that this stalemate is a simple stalemate, and that the previous two High Representative (Bonn Paddy Ashdown, who use the Bonn Gunds of public officials, should be able to make local politicians on the solution of disagreements with local politicians, and the approach of Christian Schwarz-Schilling (
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak is now criticised by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak in July, in particular, criticised Dodik 'stance and the proposal for the discrimination of the RS state union.
In a statement last month, Lajcak said the prime minister "should think that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not interested in the international community, which questions the constitution and questioning the Dayton Peace Accord."
Police have been set as the final date for an agreement on reform at the end of September.
If political leaders do not reach a compromise on this issue, the SAA will not be signed this year, and the country &aposs chances for EU candidacy will stop.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is facing the risk of its neighbours to stay more and to become the end of the European competition," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said.

Regional isolation of the region has been restored.
The stage in this part is 80km / east, or 60km from some places, and traffic police recommend that they will be cautious.
Police also promised to create regular gifts to prevent traffic excavations.
A number of disputes have been disagreements on whether to be implemented.
The public utility, in charge of the fee collection collection following a delay, said the salaries should be paid.
The government, however, decided that it would not be paid.

Reforms in Turkey continue with opposition
As authorities began to make more trust to the problems of the Kurds, the PKK has lost the need for terrorist campaign?

The Turkish government has vowed a new deficit policy against ethnic Kurdish citizens, although the Kurdistan Workers' Party has shown its response to terrorist acts.
Following a limited card action against the PKK attacks in northern Iraq, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a new and ambitious government plan, including improving economic immigration in southeastern Turkey, where the Kurdish population lives as intensive.
He also promised that a new state television will begin broadcasting Kurdish broadcast, reminding the PKK members, who surrendered and information on the organisation, or reminded the ambitious law that enabled to early evidence.
The Erdogan administration is convincing the Kurds in Turkey, in which such movements are convinced that Ankara is taking into account the concerns of them, but also hopes to block the PKK &aposs objectives.
However, the terrorist organisation continues to claim that these efforts are the only real option of the "huge option", which is the death brands of deaths.
"It is no other than the continuation of the Kurdish truth policy," said Duran Kalilovic, a member of the organisation &aposs wealth members.
The PKK, founded as a Marksist organisation that demands the establishment of a "public republic republic" in southeastern Turkey in 1970s, wants to establish an independent Kurdish state, which includes a part of northern Iraq and Iran and Syria.
The organisation, who has been trying to win the support of the Kurds in Turkey for this major life, is trying to create a discourse of government policies aimed at preserving economic diversities and Kurdish nationalism.
The organisation is also trying to achieve political power from Turkey 'ongoing military peacekeeping attacks on the PKK cameras in northern Iraq.
"The Turkish army continues to fight the PKK, while the government will continue to continue the Kurdish anti-Kurdish policies in politics, economy and society," Kalkin said in a statement published on the group website.
How do such allegations still face?
Officials in Turkey have taken concrete steps towards reducing minority rights over the past years, including linked to EU targets.
Following the death, the Kurdish case and even a political party linked to the PKK -- according to the claim of many officials in Ankara.
The government underlined that separate military action against terrorism is not enough and that the disappointment of Kurds should be addressed.
In addition, the civil society is also trying to find a political solution within the framework of civil society paramilitaries, but the last stake in 37,000 people over the five years.

Observers cause disputes
Earlier this month, the Kurdistan Democratic Force (KCK), which includes many illegal organisations from the PKK, called for dialogue with the Turkish government.
However, if the demands of other entity are not met, he warned that "a war" will be done for several years.
Meanwhile, the organisation claims they want to negotiate the situation is questioning the constitution agreements and territorial integrity of Turkey, which is not completely acceptable by Turkish officials.
The PKK has declared many times unilateral ceasefire in the past, but none of them did not continue.
Therefore, it could be sought to be an extraordinary service.
The different policies are conservative and some influential forces in the PKK see violence as a way to achieve the goal.
Although the KCK called for dialogue, PKK commander Bahmen Erdal, a Syrian citizenship, said attacks against Turkish soldiers and other goals would continue.
"The war can be sustainable and this is the only vehicle that the Kurds can achieve political winners," Kalkin said.
"PKK, weak, but most dangerous situation
"The PKK is weakened today, but the most dangerous situation.
The terror organisation, which is under pressure, could try to demonstrate the power by attacks on the polls and use the conservative bombings, "he said.
Turkey, which has organised military operations against the PKK terrorists in northern Iraq since December, has organised a eight day force in February, when the Chief of General Staff was killed at least 240 terrorists, according to information from the Chief of General Staff.
In addition to a successful military action and tightening diplomacy, he said, the PKK is slogistical and financial resources.
He added that the organisation is now on.
As a result, the organisation could try to support itself in the global or regional players, as it has been in the past -- as a "equal" of regional policies.
The PKK is in part of its structure, which can stay in mind, and has stock criminal activities in the region and Europe in this framework.
According to the US State Department for Terrorism Report on April 2007, the organisation provides the financing of its actions to drug and human trafficking activities in Europe, as well as money for organisation sympathy symbols.
Several security experts in both international and international areas have long expressed that the PKK threat is not in line with a solution based on military arbitration.
Instead, Turkey should continue to work together with other countries, especially in Europe to reduce financial sources.
In addition, the government must ensure that Kurds do not trust the civil society and the rule of law.
Sapplosive economic rest is one of the problems the PKK has been falling in the past.
Now Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a key factor for the fight against terrorism, and a planned plan to increase investments in southeastern Turkey and improve economic immigration.
Another tightening is that Turkey has the human rights to ensure security in the past many times.
The PKK has provided power in the last year, when it comes to discrimination against the Kurds, and the latest reputation of the Kurds has been sentenced to the Kurds.
So far, the rado and television programmes in Turkey were a controversy that caused the rado and television programmes.
A limited Kurdish broadcaster began in 2004.
He says this step is scheduled to move more.
In a television station, only in the Kurds, it will be broadcast in Armenia and Farsor.
The prime minister said the government will continue to continue new reforms, adding that one of the prime minister had met with the assistance in the region, leaving public expectations in a clear way.

DTP finds government programme insufficient
The Turkish government is still facing scepticism, despite the literature.
The pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) says they do not affect work.
"We must talk about whether we are restricted and restricted.
The AKP government is convinced in efforts to resolve the Kurdish issue, and I question the demands of the Kurdish people, "the AKP government said.
The DTP wants Turkey to recognise its Kurdish identity through the constitution and establish such autonomy board in southeastern Europe.
With the DTP 'basic patients, the government and the main Kurdish party in Turkey is impossible for dialogue between the government and Turkey &aposs main Kurdish party.
Erdogan faces a strong public pressure on the PKK terrorism, especially in particular, and that pressure has to do nothing about the DTP prime minister.
Earlier, Erdogan rejected his request for talks with his party members, saying he would not discuss the DTP as a terrorist organisation and not to make it clear to violence.
The hundreds of people have been hiding against PKK terrorism since last October that at least 47 people were killed in terrorist attacks, including 35 soldiers.
The PKK problem has cost more than 37,000 clients since 1984.
Meanwhile, the DTP does not show that it is different from the PKK, it is increasingly evidence that ethnic Kurds have damaged the party type.
In November 2007, the Metropoll researcher group held a public research research in the southeast.
More than a third of the participants' participants, 35.1 per cent said the DTP does not represent ethnic Kurds, while only 38.6 per cent said the party represents themselves fully.
According to Metropoll, the DTP is based on resolving the democratic rights and the Kurdish problem.
However, the party has faced a lot of negative criticism due to the recent terrorism actions, "the researchers say, one of the basic reasons that the party does not recognise the PKK as a terrorist organisation.
The research results showed that support for the PKK targets is at least.
The majority (645 per cent) opposes the establishment of a Kurdish state in northern northern north, while 95.2 per cent said they would stay in Turkey if a state is formed here.
More than half of the surveys (51.5 per cent) said the cross-border operation was necessary for the "PKK attacks in northern North".
Around 60 per cent of the participants said Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was the name.
Overall, 65 per cent of respondents voted in the elections last year, while 68.3 per cent said they would vote for AKP in the next elections.
Nevertheless, the research team warned that these figures are different than the actual election participation figures, and some participants could not want to say they support the DTP.

The first constitution of Kosovo took effect on Sunday (June 15th) after Serbia declared independence.
The constitution does not recognise a sovereignty parliamentary republic and division democracy.
Kosovo will not be a territorial claim against any country or part of the territory, and no country will not want to unite, the document said.
"Today, the constitution shows that the north of the state of the state is completed," President Fatmir Sejdiu said at a ceremony in Pristina on Sunday. "The constitution is the long way for the road."
"As of today, all institutions in Kosovo will operate in the constitution," Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said.
There is no doubt, "he said, urging all citizens and institutions to help implement the document.
"We have fulfilled our obligations as the state," Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi said. "We cannot say that the Constitutional Kosovo territory is impossible."
The constitution represents the second history of Kosovo from Serbia on February 17th, when it comes to independence.
Although three UN member states recognise Kosovo 'independence, Serbia refuses to leave these territory as legitimate, and wants talks on status.
Even if the constitution seems to see, tensions are seeing.
The question of any international board will still be convicted.
The new EU mission must begin operations Sunday, while EULEX did not do so because of obstacles.
The EU envoy for Kosovo, Pieter Feith, said the Union will depend on the police mission by October and is confident that the UN will remain Kosovo during this transition period.
Feith cautioned, however, that this is largely dependent on Serbian co-operation.
Serbia and Russia insist that the EU mission is illegal because it is not approved by the Security Council.
Furthermore, Serbian President Boris Tadic said, "Serbia does not accept the Kosovo Constitution as a legal truth."
Tadic described Serbia as a southern province of Kosovo as a southern province and argued that its own territorial integrity is not politically motivated, calling for a "political inclusive consequences".
Serbian opposing the EULEX mission is in a case of efforts to appoint police officers, judges and customs officers from the EU, in charge of functioning functions such as police, and the UN personnel staff on the matters.
"We are now in a situation where there is no mandate to take over a territorial card," said the head of the International Crisis Group for Kosovo. "This is the risk of resolving key institutions such as police and judicial, and a fragile democracy."
In Mitrovica, meanwhile, Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said that Serbs against the new constitution would form a separate parliament within two weeks.

Greeks entered in front of a unemployment bureau in Athens to receive social assistance. [Reuters]
The 130-billion-euro rescue loan, donated by international loans on Tuesday (February 21st), was not enough to disperse the overall truth.
The first package of 109 billion euros, which envisions the right trend, is in a similar way to the 109 billion-euro rescue loan, with major cuts and labour.
While the government continues to reduce salary and social assistance, it plans to reduce minimum fees for employees at 25%, and many Greeks say they are planning to reduce Greece, with a 32% increase in minimum salary and disappointment.
However, there is some analysts hope.
"We have fruitless, but the bailout agreement seems to be very favourable for Greece 'interests.
Other analysts argue that Greece could still be a chance if the government continues to implement reforms, as well as the EU has changed its position.
"We have been debating over the past ten years without any action," Greek European and Foreign Policy Foundation Director Thanos Dokos told SETimes.
Many bloggers like the University of Athens, economic professor Yanis Merouis, do not see the reputation of Greece 'current strategy.
"So far, the people have been aware of the fact that the Greek government -- with the overall optimism -- the main deficit of 9% -- it is aware that Greece will not be able to pay its bailout loans," he said.
Even though a 240 billion-euro loan package and debt, the country will not stop its debt rise and reducing national revenues.
Thanassis Skokos has criticised Greeks for their behaviour, and that "the division of Greeks in the world has been in charge of their behaviour," said Thanassis Skokos, who has been in charge of the world "of the democracy of humanitarian, sculpture and jazlan Zorba
"The fact that the legendary, the legends and them are not enough to work," he said.
Skokos argues that the stalemate in Greeks has been restricted from the elections, and any solution would be imposed to the new elections.
"If we do not exercise, we are more likely to be removed by the Greeks," he said.
Another blog writer says Greece has returned to a political scene and a consequence.
It is responsible for political elimination of the situation and described them as an architecture, which protects its own interests and their own interests.
"Former Prime Minister George Papandreou continues to support the space of PASOK, although the country was dismissed.
Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos, who has been interested in two counts of property and income taxes, wants to be prime minister, although he is not a country that will manage his part because he helped him. "

Serbia-Montenegro State Union Semotions, Market
It is a true that Serbia-Montenegro has yet to decide on a flat, military uniforms and national margineering, and that the state union can be difficult to protect its union.
Meanwhile, both constituent republics approved their own symbols.

Both Serbia and Montenegro have chosen new state symbols. On August 17th, Serbia approved a national marathon of a "Reviewal of Justice", in which two smaller and low cancer broadcast carrying military units have been cancelled.
In July, Montenegro chosen its own symbols of its own symbols: the new rhetoric of the 19th century has been replaced in the full middle of the flag, open, a gold card.
The new architecture of the small republic was a former national song, "Ah", the Special Storm of May.
The state symbols of state symbols have caused political reactions, while some argue the initiative to ratify the government &aposs pro-independence stance.
Instead, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Dyukanovic announced that the symbols will represent a united Montenegro that would win independence by 2005.
Other Montenegrin officials have expressed similar views.
Serbia, meanwhile, expressed confidence that the prime minister was announced, and the pro-Serbian opposition in Montenegro is increasing violence.
Observers predict the new symbols will be "short government".
Dyukanovic refuses to the government &aposs accusations against the Montenegrin people.
However, all of the ruling lawmakers do not meet.
Although Muslim lawmakers in various cafes of the Social Democratic Party are opposed to military universities and conservations, political unity has given the award on this issue.
As part of the Belgrade Treaty, the Belgrade Agreement, a special commission needs to propose the quality of the republics that have been united for the state union.
The army was not expected to create a major problem.
Both republics use three renowned cities, but the Montenegrin flag was used by "discovery" instead of the Serbs ".
The two state controversy and discussed the possibility of accepting a joint "gasoline".
Military universities will have a two-round cancel, but the siege has not yet been uncertain that Montenegrin textbooks do not have the poor channels, or Serbian textile channels.
Museum archaeologists are on display because Serbian and Montenegro have a different musicians, and they say they would create a lot of tolerance because they have different musicians.
Although the bill on the creation of the Marnin failed to enter the parliamentary procedure in early August, there was no support for him and was made from the agenda until September.
As a result, Serbia-Montenegro athletes won a medal at the Athens Olympics, while the former Communist marathon is "Hey Slavs".
The song, which has been used by the Milosevic regime, has been repeatedly taken by Serbs during the national team.
Analysts say the issue shows how Serbia-Montenegro can protect the state union.
If the two constituent republics operate in the bridge, the lack of joint state symbols will not be many problems.
So far, however, there is no situation.
Montenegro, meanwhile, is preparing to hold a referendum on independence next year.

According to one of the reports, more than 40,000 Serbs, Roma, Open, Egyptian and Albanian houses have been forced to avoid violence.
Redmond said that about 2,000 people are from the house.
The UNHCR said the target of violence and co-ordinated as a co-ordination of the violence has caused a major fear and isolation of several minority communities.
The move is serious, and many are not able to travel without KFOR.
Such restrictions affect the economic situation, enabling them to receive goods and make business travel.
Although Kosovo Serbs, Roma, Agriculture and other minority groups have been restricted in some areas where they have been restricted before violence in mid-March, many of them are said to speed up preparations for new emergency cases.
"In all these information, UNHCR has made it clear that a continuous international tension for asylum asylum seekers from the Kosovo minority groups, especially in the Serbs, Roma, Azerbaides and Egyptians, as well as a few opponents of Kosovo Albanians who live in some parts of northern Kosovo," Redmond said.
In addition, UNHCR recommends that the current health and social prosperity in Kosovo -- for example, the obstacles, obstacles in some categories, and those who live in some categories -- should not be returned.

Kosovo has highest credit rates in the region
The Kosovo Reconstruction Commission is investigating whether the high interest rates in the country have not been imposed without an interethnic agreement.
By Muhamet Brajshori for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 20 / 09 / 11

Since 1999, nine banks have been operating in Kosovo, and high credit rates are affected by the country ’ s economic development.
Following that, the Kosovo Reconstruction Commission (KRK) began investigating whether banks have a mutual agreement or no hotels that interest rates are high.
"Kosovo banks have been investigated on suspicion of cartel type agreements.
If we can achieve the reveals, the penalties envisioned in the Reconstruction Law could find 10% of the annual bronze profit, "he said.
Raiffeisen Bank and ProCrete Bank, a loan of the banking system, are being implemented more interest rates than their own countries in Kosovo.
"The interest rates of banks in the country are much similar to each other, as well as the rates of the region," he said.
The Pristina Institute for Employment Studies (GAP) is a three-year study on the Kosovo banking system, which includes the most popular credit types of loans -- personal, commercial, agriculture, agriculture and cars -- the most popular loans submitted by the Kosovo banking system.
Experts argue that many businesses are based on the banking loan, but high interest rates are not created for the development of the business climate.
"The changes in the interest rates between 2011 and 2011 have changed between 9% and 24%," Rudina Heroi-Puka of the GAP Institute told SETimes.
The business and agriculture loans have lower interest rates compared to the rates of commercial and agricultural loans, which created 70% of the total loans in Kosovo over the past three years, "he said.
Heroi-Puka argues that low interest rates will improve Kosovo 'economic development and financial stability.
"The interest rates have a positive impact on credit demand and, which is improving the economy with investment and consumption," said Heroi Puka.
"Among the banks, there is no co-ordination that they will agree on fixed interest rates.
Instead, the banks have a simple profit, and each has no motivation to compete with others.
This status is that there are two or three cheapers in the country that have competitiveness, and the market leader is being discovered by the bank, "he said.
Abdixhiku added that the government has allowed the change in the banking system, while it must take steps to strengthen financial stability.
"The ratification of the law on ambitious networks will allow them to be given the treasure as a first step in this direction.
In second, I can say the functioning of courts is a precondition for reducing the risk of debt.
Furthermore, the cadastro loss will allow the credibility system to increase the loan rates of the housing loan system, "he said.
According to the Bank Watch report, the financial crisis in Kosovo has led to a loan of banks last year, but still a little damage.
"The global financial crisis has affected the quality of the Kosovo economy and the bank loan.
Therefore, the total loans have 5.9% of the total loans, while the rate was 4.4% in 2009 and 3% in 2008.
Banks see growth in western loans as a risk of risk, which caused the rise of interest rates in early 2011, "he said.

Croatian accession agreement will be signed in December. [Reuters]
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk arrived in Zagreb on Saturday (September 17th) to bring the EU accession agreement to Croatia.
The document was signed in December and will open the way for Croatia to become a full EU member in 2013.
"When Croatia joined the EU, Croatia will be an important optimism and confidence scandal for the future of the EU," Tusk said at a press conference after the meeting.
Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said the EU accession treaty has reached this draft, but that Croatia has achieved its strategic and historical goal.
However, there are many jobs and things that are not only for the EU, but what Croatia must do for its own climate.
"We see that Croatia has a lot of challenges where other member states live.
The delay of Croatia is politically motivated, and it was very chance to do so, "he said.
"Croatia must be more aspirated by reforms.
As in Bulgaria, this is the only way to establish unnecessary sanctions. "
SDP MP Tonino Picula told SETimes that Tusk was very surprise that Tusk was given a visit to local media organisations.
"I think that we have done in this case, but I hope that the public will be very confident that it is not the EU, but I am sure that it is not in the current government," Picula said.
Although the country has been slowly decreased for its participation, most Croats support it.
"I expect Croatia to end the EU negotiation story," Zagreb Anamarija Tokic told SETimes.
Ben … I want the children to have the opportunity for education abroad, gain abroad experience and learn their life in the EU.
The EU must be that. "
However, Picula noted, no candidate country has not declined to a situation Croatia faces.
Last year -- the ruling party has been a lot of debate.
As of 2009, authorities have revealed one of the biggest immunity scandals in the country.
Eight people were arrested for abuse of 54m euros in local food producer Ljubravka.
Among the suspects are former Deputy Prime Minister Damir Polancec, who resigned on the scandal.
"In a way, Kosor shares [former Prime Minister Ivica Racan] the same political female: both have met very important tasks in the past months," Picula said, citing the December elections.

The EU and the IMF told Greece on Monday (September 19th) that it is reducing public sector reforms and accelerate the next language of a 110 billion-euro bailout loan signed with them last year.
The new warning came during a three-hour conference between Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos and the so-called European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and high-level representatives.
According to the Greek daily Kathimerini, the Greek finance ministry "produced and described as" important ", the government has focused on the measures needed to take the sixth six-billion-euro loan of 8 billion euros.
Greece is urging the new credit engineering of a new credit engineering to disrupt its debt.
Officials recently cautioned that the country will be examined in mid-October.
In a report on uncertain sources, Kathimerini also pushed for a series of new measures, including improving public sector reforms, stressing the need for acceleration of public sector reforms, as well as a number of new measures, including the implementation of gas.
According to the newspaper, this means an increase of 40 cents per little.
Venizelos reported that the government will take measures to meet its commitments to the EU and the IMF, as well as promising any step to prevent the country &aposs bankruptcy.
"We are not just for the Eurozone, but for our children and we have to implement everything we must implement for our children, and we have continued determination," the minister said on Monday.
Greece hopes to receive a new language of the bailout package earlier this month.
A team of inspectors arrived in Athens in early September to review the progress in meeting the requirements of the country ’ s bailout bailout loans before the next round of aid was decided.
The delegation, however, left the country on the size of the budget deficit and due to the dispute.
About ten days later, the government announced a new measure aimed at bringing the legitimate targets set by the EU and the IMF last year, as well as to ensure significant financing.
Pakette also includes a new property tax that Greek authorities hope that they will help cover 2 billion euros to close the budget deficit this year.
The IMF does not affect this idea to resolve the open problem, but said it should be focused on tax collection.
"We cannot impose taxes that are moving to a limited tax," IMF representative to Greece Bob Traa said in Athens on Monday. "What is the economic sustainability?"
Therefore the need is more powerful, "Traa said, adding that" the tax trafficking issue is more powerful. "
Furthermore, inefficient public enterprises should be closed and "extremely excessive public sector workers and climate public sector salaries should be reduced," he said.
Traa also criticised Greek authorities for failing to end the government 'implementation of the privatisation programme.
"The privatisation team has stalled because politicians do not agree on how to be done.
Our country is to be bankruptcy. "

Although the north faces Pristina on the north, Serbia is in other places.

Following a week last week in northern Kosovo, Belgrade appeared to have revealed the two potential problems.
First, some Bosniaks in the Sandzak region in western Serbia announced they would ask autonomy.
At the end, Albanians in southern Serbia have complained with local education requirements and organised protests.
Analysts in Belgrade believe developments in this two region are linked to the Kosovo crisis and the goal of Serbia to gain EU candidate status by the end of the year.
"Currently, Serbia is under major pressure on northern Kosovo, as well as other issues concerning the possibility of EU candidate status," said Predrag Simic, a political scientific professor at the University of Belgrade. "I think that such a pressure is very critical that Serbia is in the same time to Brussels."
The Sandzak problem was dismissed on Thursday (September 15th) with the leader of the Muslim Community in Serbia, Muammar Zukorlic, who announced a statement Thursday (September 15th).
Zukorlic criticised Belgrade for discrimination against Bosniaks in Sandzak and announced that the region would ask autonomy.
Sandzak will open regional vehicles in Brussels, Washington, Istanbul and Sarajevo, he added.
Zukorlic support came from Bosnian Muslim leader Reis Mustafa Ceric, who criticised Belgrade for "increasing discrimination" against Sandzak Bosniaks.
Belgrade wants to create a "fear and classic climate", Ceric said, warning that "a new crisis point in Europe".
He discovered the current atmosphere with the previous climate of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s.
Ceric comments have not been met with the ratification of the Bosniak party representatives in the Serbian government.
Bosniak MP Meho Omerovic, a member of the ruling coalition, said Ceric 'remarks were "reminded and dangerous" and will not benefit Bosniaks in Sandzak.
"Instead of defining its anonymity, it is a factor of new divisions," Omerovic said.
According to Dusan Janjic, head of the Forum for Ethnic Relations, the debate is not the winner.
"Such words want the Sandzic issue to replace the agenda of Serbia," Janjic said. "If Serbia becomes a candidate on the agenda of membership, Serbia could be a historic date for the start of negotiations with the EU."
Simic, meanwhile, is participating in the coastal coast with the Milosevic period.
However, Simic said Sandzak has lived in social tensions that caused economic problems and cause.
"In Sandzak, there is a very poor social situation from the situation in Serbia, but because of the multiethnic structures of Bosnia and Herzegovina, both ethnic units," Simic told SETimes.
Following the announcement on Sandzak, thousands of Albanians live in southern Serbia complained from violations in the education system for minorities, organised a protest in Bujanovac on September 13th.
The Albanian representative in the Serbian parliament said it is "political" and its goal is to show the problems of education because of the Albanians "lack of textbooks in Albanian language".
After that incident, the Serbian government said it is really violated in the system, stressing that efforts to resolve the issue would be trying to speed up.

[AFP] Zoran Djindjic, the assassination of Slobodan Milosevic, has continued to increase corruption and crisis activities, despite the end of Slobodan Milosevic.
Belgrade police, who tried to stop the problem, have questioned more than 7.500 people to question the needed reforms.

Following the scenarios, police in each other have received a funeral to fulfil their last duties to former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic.
They are on April 8th, with the damage in Belgrade.
Stambolic, a policy adviser to Slobodan Milosevic, was later falling in one of the largest parents in Belgrade, in the summer of 2000.
"In the past 1,000 days have shown the truth of us," the daily Danas quoted Grojica Sasoyevic, executive director of the daily Denas saying. "The paramilitaries were discovered, a government president and a head of state was killed.
All these were evidence of a wrong preference that was held 16 years ago, "he said.
Stambolic was shot in a mountain near Novi Sad in March, with a car that was closed.
The suspects of suspects, known as the Red Berets, were arrested by some of the Zemun mafia group, and are estimated by Milosevic and his wife Mirjana Markovic.
Markovic is believed to have fled to Russia, his son, Marko Milosevic, who has been on the Interpol list shortly ago.
During the police operation called "Kilicc", the Serbian Interior Ministry said 7.73 people have been questioned since the extraordinary declaration was declared, and 20.02 people were detained.
Those who were found that they will be able to form a small private army: 13 mostly, 217 cars, 436 cars, 536 hectares, 318 hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of bombs, 318 hundreds of hundreds of bombs, and anti-terrorism rockets, and 1017 euros are also prepared to sell a number of
Due to official reports, the measures blocked almost all drug traffic traffic, with the extraordinary declaration of emergency, a serious blow to the drug market and drug donations in Serbia, where the number of drug marks are 150.
The former Yugoslav Army Security agency, Aco Tomic and the adviser of former Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica, Rade Bulatovic, was arrested in the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic.
The Democratic Opposition Party of Serbia (DOS) is expected to focus on Kostunica 'charges against the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and take new arrests.
The Democratic Party (DP), Kostunica and his party have accused the government of supporting the protests by the end of last year and consistently attacking the government, calling them to contribute to the airport. According to the DP, all of them were prepared for the post-Djindjic climate, Kostunica called a legitimacy of police unit.
The Serbian government and the DSS are unfair that the protest was in the worst details of the Milosevic regime, and that they should be dismissed and dismissed if they are facing much more consequences.
The DOS and DSS continued political withdrawal, after Zivkovic 'extraordinary extraordination. The DSS, DOS, accusing the DOS of a criminal group against organised crime, accusing the current political hospitals.
Zivkovic was the top of disputes among the prime minister and the National Bank, after Serbia declared the National Bank of Serbia as an unrest.
Critics are concerned about the extraordinary extraordinary public interest for the ruling war.
Following the opposition parties' leaders' programmes, journalists are among the government 'critics.
A young woman was sentenced to 8 days in prison for interpretation with Serbian government officials on the internet.
The government made a statement on the decision to close the Nacional newspaper.
The government was initially planning to establish a committee to assess the contribution to the establishment of the classic climate, but then criticised the idea.
Public opinion polls say politicians still have significant support for organised crime and the political climate, while the fight against organised crime and the political climate must focus on issues that the political climate should not be more damaged.
Serbia faces significant problems.
There is no electoral president; the new constitution has yet to be completed, the economy has not been exaggerated and lack of shortcomings.
All this shows that Serbia should be in the process of resolving its internal problems in the coming period.
The murder of Djindjic is clear that this society and the local policy is deeply left.
However, the anti-mafia movement has made an end and accelerated reforms, ensuring the effects of traffic.

Agriculture and Doha Trade Process

Former Romanian Finance Minister and economist Daniel Daianu says the situation is in the summer.
By Daniel Daianu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 22 / 09 / 03
In the past period, all the world has been convinced on Iraq and the Middle East.
Many government agencies the agenda of geopolitical issues and terrorism attacks.
However, the economic situation in many parts of the world is facing problems such as Gaji Safi Hurtist Hasila, high or high unemployment disputes, the poverty of trade disputes, increasingly spreading natural disasters, the geopolitical materials, or the second plan is unable to convince these issues, such as geopolitical and terrorism.
As the United States is the logistics of the world economy, some countries are based on positive signals that the US economy will demonstrate, however, the ongoing economic stalemate in Western Europe, or even a stalemate of the optimism.
In addition to these conditions, the situation in the country, social, economic and politically faces the situation.
In a large part of Africa, the economic problems in some areas of Latin American and Asia are also included in economic problems, social discrimination and division, ethnic conflict and violence factors.
The state and government governments, which have been repeatedly ended, are a dynamic that is increasingly worried.
These trends are also an important commitment to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) meeting in Cancin.
As the DOHA Trade Process initiated, many environmental processes have met with a vulnerable vehicle, not only to overcome protective trends, but also in accordance with the current balance in the world trade.
The DOHA Chamber of Commerce is expected to focus on the basis of the world trade controversial trade controversy on the agenda. The developed countries are expected to focus on agricultural restrictions and a negative impact on agriculture economies, which are also the most serious restrictions for the enlargement of developing countries, and the agricultural products.
For many of the countries that have already been under way, agricultural products are the main export of exports.
In other poor countries, the large part of public spending is on food expenses.
The United States and the EU have provided subsidies worth about 280 billion euros annually in agriculture, but some 50 billion euros in developing.
This high subsidies on countries that have been implemented are caused by production, and their own products have caused their own products to competition against farmers of developing countries.
There is no serious obstacles to meeting the legitimate demands of developed countries.
Several farmers in the rich countries can have to tackle the implementation of reforms by creating an effective loan.
In addition, the transfer of security concerns are also taking place at the time when the threats of extraordinary policy threats are increasingly intended to prevent excessive dependence on foreign supplies.
The current arrangements are difficult to punish villages in poor countries and fight major missile efforts to undermine development.
For years, the World Bank has been aware of the negative situation, the United States and EU senior officials have been aware of the realistic factors, but national interests, set up by a narrow, have been an obstacle to a viable reform process.
A deal on the trade of agricultural products by the United States and the EU is expected to focus on Cancin.
However, analysts do not have any concrete figure on tax and subsidies, or expensive restrictions, as analysts observe.
This agreement, which has not been an important importance as a result, is more complicated.
Furthermore, progress in trade on agricultural products (particular) could affect the meetings in Cancin, in particular, on trade units.
The EU has shown a very determined stance on joint talks on investment rules, competitiveness policy and other trade arrangements.
These rules, called "Singin", are crucial, but the debate is not seen as a critical factor in this stage.
If the primary formation is not implemented and not implemented, trade rules could not contribute to economic development in poor countries.
Of course, commercial issues will not exceed the Doha agenda, noting that the meeting in Cancin would weaken the possibility of failing.
The agricultural sector in Southeast Europe is widely wide.
In general, 8 per cent of GDP and 20 per cent of agriculture.
Albania, for example, is approaching 50 per cent.
The large part of the population is not able to live in rural areas, as well as the low and public budget.
Tourism has not been achieved in terms of technology / efficiency, and there is no improvement in the EU markets, the population in Southeast Europe, which has been agriculture, has not been achieved.
With the high unemployment rate in the region, this problem could be more pressure on local economies, ensuring social disputes.
The demands for the agricultural products to EU markets are a strong basis for the reformist of European integration (CEP), which is more easily easier for agricultural products, and is seeking to continue to be made due to the high number of social reasons, poor and social reasons, and social reasons for the population.
In terms of these countries, subsidies will provide such a security network when it comes to public budget cuts. Poland and Hungary and Hungary are expected to join the EU in 2004.
In Romania and Bulgaria, which is widely widely broad, the situation is more serious in the Western Balkans: the EU wants to join and agricultural subsidies to the market, as well as more access to the market.
Therefore, the English Agriculture Policy, considered one of the specific problems for world trade, could cause uncertain policies in the EU accession process.
Most of these countries want to participate in the club, but the economy is not enough for competitiveness.
The effective social security networks have not been created, and if there is no intention to create intelligence employment, the poverty problem could be except if there is no few restrictions for abroad.
The countries in the EU accession process should be widely widely broad, as the Ancka Doha trade process is important for the development of poor countries.
The Balkan countries, which have already seen the EU accession as an integrated violation of agricultural subsidies (and even more interest in agricultural subsidies), could be able to provide more powerful protection and facilitate exports of agricultural products if the Doha trade process successfully.
Though the Doha trade process can be achieved, the leaders of the developed countries must show a vision of state businessman, interest in the problems of the world 'poor countries and create active policies.

EU offer new political agreement to Serbia
EU foreign ministers, who did not reach an agreement on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, have offered an interim agreement.
(AFP, FT, The Guardian, Euobserver, Blic - 29 / 01 / 08; Reuters, AP, DPA, BBC, AKI, International Herald Tribune, Balkan Insight, Beta, B92, EU - 28 / 01 / 08)

EU foreign ministers decided on Monday (January 28th) to offer an interim political agreement that has improved co-operation in trade and education, and facilitate visa requirements for Serbian passengers.
"We have accepted a very tense mechanism that opened the way for Serbia to join the EU," Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said after a meeting in Brussels.
Most ministers attended the meeting with Serbia in November to suspend the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU in November.
A decision, however, was blocked by the Netherlands, who insisted that Serbia must fulfil its requirement for full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) first.
The Hague tribunal still wants to arrest and hand over four remaining war crimes suspects, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military commander Ratko Mladic in the 1990s.
Furthermore, EU foreign ministers have agreed on a new proposal, which Rupel described as the first important step towards eventual membership in the bloc.
According to EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, Serbia must see its new proposal as a "very powerful message" that the bloc is part of Europe and that their countries have clear prospects to join the Union.
The EU plans to sign a new framework agreement on February 7th, four days after the presidential runoff in Serbia.
Brussels hopes to boost the chance of elected President Boris Tadic, the pro-European member of this history, to be elected.
The EU fear that a victory of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party would return to the country and prepare for regional stability.
Nikolic is head of the party, Vojislav Seselj, who has been arrested in The Hague.
Some EU officials have expressed their hopes for signing a new agreement if Nikolic wins, nor a new SAA agreement.
"If Nikolic won the victory, the workers will be more different," the AFP quoted Spanish Minister for European Affairs Alberto Navario as telling reporters at the sidelines of a meeting in Brussels.
"Today there are many things that will be lost in Serbia," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. "Serbian citizens are elected between a nationalist past and a European future.
I am confident that the Serbian people will elect the European future and understand that it will be really really. "
Human Rights in Turkey: Reconstruction of Relations
Several countries, including Turkey, have said they do not do enough efforts to stop human trafficking.
The Turkish government, however, says they have taken several measures.

According to experts, the biggest reasons in human trafficking are poverty and political pressure or threats.
Experts say that if the human trafficking networks are not captured, people who seek ammunition will not bring a solution to the question.
The high income of about 2,000 euros per composer has been increased by 2002, due to the low risk and the minimum level of prison, the sentence of human trafficking has not been increased by 2002.
Turkey signed security and co-operation agreements with 61 countries to prevent illegal immigration and human trafficking, in a bid to change 201 of the Turkish Penal Code, citing a permanent punishment, as well as to prevent illegal immigration and human trafficking.
Under the National Programme for Turkey &aposs EU accession, the government must bring refugee policies in line with the EU criteria.

Romania and Bulgaria, the two Southeast European countries, are expected to join the European Union on 1 January 2007.
Another candidate country, Croatia is on the agenda of the accession process.
Meanwhile, some EU members are worried about the process of enlargement, while Balkan countries continue to move forward in line with their accession targets.
"I think that the countries' accession processes will be in the same way, it is the governments in the region to establish the economic, institutional and political arrangements in order to ensure the EU.
I think that the participation is in terms of economic policy.
In particular, "a functioning market economy" and the EU must be able to revive a economy with a market capacity that could cause the losses that could lead to a competitive environment, and to make economic competitiveness more deeply.
By entering the European club, the traditional policies must comply with a rules that are destroyed.
For example, free movement of capital in the EU (capital) is a challenge to liberalisation of the capital account (capital), and an increase is dangerous.
Meanwhile, the new members will remain in the case, including a trip or the eurozone.
A competitive economy, which is not competitive, is a true that the common currency will be difficult in this market, which is used by the common currency.
In countries participating in the EU, financing sector, an independent central bank, the property rights of property, and a private sector, which is defined and preserved, should also be key, such as a healthy judicial system and mechanisms, such as a health care system and implementation of the mechanisms.
The capacity to fight corruption and organised crime is one of the key preconditions.
economic stability is essential.
For that, inflation has to be working in the determination, continuing to be at low levels of budget deficits and control of the budget deficits.
The path of economic stability, tightening budget restrictions and good governance bodies are spread in both the public sector and the private sector.
The huge budget deficits are growing pressure on the pension system.
Public enterprises are one of the key issues that have created concern.
Three of these organisations are not a major job.
Some public enterprises will be better than the public, and such organisations should be improved as a solution.
Special organisations should be subjected to a good arrangement and therefore citizens should not have to pay excessive prices for services.
Economic stability is one of the key problems facing many candidates. [EU]
However, we need some warnings that are dealing with food observers.
In addition, the economic policy must create a commercial balance.
A low annual inflation rate of 2 per cent is a very difficult goal for the economies that the EU average is 5-10 times when it comes to the purchase park.
In addition to the growing economies, the demands have been classified with inflation.
The rise of the prices of local service (Balassa-Samuelson) could cause it.
The Balkan economies have spent more than 5 per cent in recent years, such as Central and Eastern Europe.
However, this growth has to be sustainable, and a more stable human resources need to invest.
The low budget deficits, which are now being seen, could be removed from two minutes.
First, the low numbers could be hiding the truth of the public services, such as infrastructure, education, education and health, but insufficient financing is insufficient and serious problem in the region economies.
The second, the new members will have to increase public spending in the framework of the bureau, after joining the EU.
Therefore, the possibility of the budget deficits is under control.
The ruling could block increasing budget deficits to overcome a general economic stability if they do not make progress on tax evasion (retirement system) reform.
It is not an enormous situation in the growing economies, with the current account deficits and budget deficits at the same time.
In the Middle East and Eastern European economies, economic growth rates are greater than EU members, and the current account deficit has been increased due to the increase of banks' private sector loans.
The current account account deficit accounts for direct investments also enjoys serious risks, under the framework of capital account liberalisation.
The boycott of foreign statements is the fact that the governments are trying to create a feasible budget policy.
The IMF is the reason for Bulgaria to expect the budget deficit in the past period, which has been over 12 per cent of the current account deficit in GDP, and the currency board does not allow the water foreign currency.
We have returned to competitiveness at this point.
Regional economies may be a significant increase in capital, or could be an excessive increase in foreign currency rules, since the region could be able to be very high inflation.
This affects competitiveness and employment.
This will be more important in the economies, such as Western Balkan countries, such as unemployment.
It is not a solution to low wage practice at the time the products exported from China and other Asia countries have been transferred to European markets.
The reputation of the reputation has been largely over the period of ensuring low wage competition in Europe.
To protect competitiveness in the long term, the new development of IT and communications technologies and serious investments in human resources must be made.
Another important issue is that the Kitlesel immigrants have a number of important benefits, but the problems could be able to cover.
Public money, who worked abroad, can suffer a 25-40 per cent part of the trade deficits (Romania and Bulgaria), as well as millions of euros.
In other news, however, the bankruptcy worker is losing through immigrants, and many families are damaged.
In this consensus, the unemployment rate of Western Balkan countries is very high, and it is possible to say that the worker exports are clear.
As a result, governments in the Western Balkan countries should not see the reality of the economic demonstrations in recent years, pragmatic behaviour in decades and should benefit the experiences of both the former and new members of the EU.
The effect of the winners' elections in Greece is not certain.
New Democracy surveys still seem to be the most smaller parties, while the public seems to be smaller.

The five-day reputation of deaths rose to 65, while Greek flags were injured in public buildings.
The excavations were discovered by the end of 13 countries.
When the Felahu was considered the size of the agency, many expect a political structure.
Those have no house, while thousands of people were unfortunately.
More than 45 million villages have not discovered the network of 500,000 returns and agricultural supplies.
Says were an aggressive animal.
The worst house that the country has been seen in the past century was only weeks before the early general elections, scheduled for September 16th.
Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis and the ruling New Democracy (ND) party are responsible for "environmental terrorists", while parties in various parts of the political disaster have convicted the government to overcome its criticism to the crisis.
However, public opinion polls issued after the mines pointed to a simple situation.
Although the ND has been criticised, the surveys are a difference between 0.7% and 3.5%.
Nevertheless polls suggest that two of the population are not satisfied with the fight against them, and one of both say that it is even more government.
Nevertheless, the ruling party lost only one per cent or two% support.
The main opposition party, PASOK, seems to have achieved a political paramilitary.
The party was named the country for more than ten years before the ND defeated in March 2004, and was charged with violating weak environmental protection laws.
The ultranationalists and other consequences, who are turned to the public, are seen as the best benefit of the current situation, causing concerns about what they can enter parliament for the first time.
Among the smaller parties, they are also involved in the euro.
If the two main parties are questioning, voters of the so-called and right parties say 11% of them are undetermined.
"This is caused to increase the popularity of smaller parties," the British daily Independent reported on Tuesday (September 4th).
"This is a result that the state cannot be able to avoid the authors of the state, then it would not be able to deal with them and not solve the situation."
Among the public, e-posters and blog software are are calling for the public to give their votes above the two main parties.
The amendments are a general concern that the lack of infrastructure between the Greek people, which is not only the existing government.
Most of the public believe this is the success of the government.
This means that five parties could be able to enter parliament.
Greece could soon be able to find itself a weak government based on the alliance of small political forces.

Kosovo first woman president
Atife Jahjaga was elected as a historic agreement between the main parties.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 08 / 04 / 11

Following an unprecedented development, Kosovo has met with leading political parties and agreed on a new president.
The vote was the first female president of Kosovo, following a vote in parliament on Thursday (April 7th). Jahjaga, who was elected by the Kosovo police, was the first woman.
Jahjaga was easier to ease 80 of the 100 deputies who participated in the vote by rival Suzane Novoberiu.
Only a round of votes was needed.
All parliamentary parties outside Vetevendosje attended the event.
"I am reflecting the changes that Kosovo has lived in the past decade," said Jahjaga, who wrote to lawmakers after the president.
The new president also expressed support for talks between Kosovo and Serbia.
"We will learn and build the future of the past," Jahjaga said.
He was a joint candidate for the three parties -- the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) and the Alliance for New Kosovo (AKR).
Arbana Vidiki, head of the Radio Free Europe office in Kosovo, told SETimes that the agreement is "an important step towards the political consensus that Kosovo is committed in the past period".
"If the political support of Jahjaga [is] a good start," he said.
Prime Minister Hashim Thaci said the immunity was achieved.
international representatives in Kosovo welcomed the political consensus, while US Ambassador Christopher Dell said the country 'ability to become a difficult period of the young institutions and the ability of the country.
"Only the structures and institutions are not based on pressure, but the leaders have proved that they can keep the interests of individual or party interests," Dell said.
"At a time when Kosovo institutions are damaged and all questioned whether they do not have the authority to ensure the people of Kosovo, Atife Jahjaga will be an important symbolic of the country 'commitment to justice and I believe that the president will be the beginning of a new and constructive page in this country," he said.
However, politicians are not satisfied.
Parliament Speaker Jakup Krasniqi said the agreement was unconstitutional, and charged Thaci of accusing him with the party regret.
Krasniqi serves as president since a court decision last month led the resignation of Behgjet Pacolli.
Meanwhile, Visar Ymeri, deputy head of the Vetevendosje, has criticised the agreement between the main parties for ancient democratic.
He claimed that the president of Jahjaga "would be the chance of the party agreement that brought the end of the Kosovo republic".
Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot leaders agreed on sovereignty, citizens
The Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot leaders agreed on "prency" on key issues of the Cyprus issue for decades, while boosting a comprehensive reconciliation prospects soon.

Cypriot President Demetris Christofias (right) and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat agreed on some key issues. [Getty Images]
"The two leaders discussed unilateral sovereignty and citizens and reached an agreement," the UN said on Tuesday (July 1st) after a meeting between Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat. "They have agreed to discuss full details of the implementation of them."
The surprise statement sparked mixed reactions and expectations in Cyprus.
Discussions on the issue and citizens are the most difficult issue.
The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has demanded "federation" to protect the rights of Turkish Cypriots.
The violence in 1960 forced many of the Turkish Cypriots to live in their enclaves on the island.
Therefore, they oppose any strong university government under Greek Cypriot control.
The protection of the unilateral sovereignty of Cyprus was one of the main positions of the Greek Cypriots.
The last major effort to unite Cyprus envisions a "single international sovereignty" in 2004, when Turkish Cypriots rejected the Turkish Cypriots, the Annan Plan, which was rejected by Greek Cypriots, but also guaranteed the Turkish Cypriot state "to recognise Turkish Cypriots.
The details of the agreement reached on both sovereignty on Tuesday have not been announced.
Analysts say the UN is "constructive uncertainty" on sovereignty and citizens "to encourage negotiations.
The agreement on Tuesday was a change for the Turkish Cypriots, but Talat forced Christofias to accept the reopening of full talks before.
So far, the Greek Cypriot government has slowed the process and insisted that comprehensive preparations have been made before the negotiations are beginning.
Turkish Cypriot nationalists charged Talat on Tuesday that Turkish Cypriots' unilateral sovereignty -- the only sovereignty of the Turkish Cypriots' historic case '-- would mean "discrimination".
The ruling Republican Democratic Party, however, acknowledged that the Greek Cypriots did not show a real interest in the start of comprehensive negotiations.
Christioofas has been under pressure from their own radio.
Although the Greek Cypriots have fought against Turkish Cypriots who have fled to northern Cyprus over the past few years, Christian office recently announced they are ready to accept 50,000 Turkish immigrants.
Turkish Cypriot Parliament Speaker Fateoglu described the meeting as a good step.
"There will be details of the details of Agriculture and citizens, when the negotiations began," he said.
Although the Greek Cypriot leadership is a member of the EU in 2004, the island does not benefit the northern part of the island, because the EU is monitoring the international understanding that it does not recognise the separate Turkish Cypriot state.
Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot leaders will meet on July 25th.

The decision ended with authorities in Skopje and Pristina in late March to form a joint border agreement commission.
According to Macedonian Investment Commission President Todor Nanev, the teams are six main topics in the first 12 km part of the border.
Furthermore, there are ramines that have been an increase on the border.
According to Macedonian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vasko Andonovski, authorities expect the border emphasis to be completed this summer, while the process will determine air conditions in the region.

Serbian elections are crucial for the country &aposs chances of EU membership
Serbia, which is prepared for the January 21st elections, seems to have many options.
In the country, where the ultranationalist party, a president of The Hague indictee, is estimated to win a large part of the votes of the ultranationalist party, continued democratic parties are under pressure to leave their differences.

The parliamentary elections, held in Serbia on January 21st, could be very important for the country ’ s future in Europe.
The public opinion polls show that the democratic bloc, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the Socialist Party of Serbia, such as the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and the Socialist Party of Serbia, has little chance to represent the political heritage.
Two years after the front of the Milosevic regime in The Hague on March 11th, democratic parties in Serbia face three basic problems. The southern Serbian province, which has been under UN administration since 1999, will likely be resolved after the elections.
Still, Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, who has been charged with genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina, must be transferred to The Hague, if the trend could be established.
The new government, meanwhile, has to make a major effort to continue talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
Discussions were suspended in May this year, due to Mladic was not handed over to any justice.
According to a public opinion poll by the Medium Gallup agency, the new parliament is likely to be a victory in The Hague, while leader Vojislav Seselj expects to be tried in The Hague.
The survey shows that the Radicals won 34.9 per cent of the votes and will increase 102 lawmakers from the 250-seat parliament.
"I hope that the democratic forces and a single goal -- EU membership and the improvement of the living standards of citizens -- will win the elections," Serbian President Boris Tadic said on the elections. [Getty Images]
According to the survey results, Serbian President Boris Tadic &aposs Democratic Party is the party of Serbian President Boris Tadic, which would win 22.9 per cent of the vote.
The third name is expected to win 13.9 per cent of the vote, the party of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, the Democratic Party of Serbia.
The congress, which was scheduled to elect a first time since Milosevic earlier this month, is estimated that the Socialists, prepared to choose 5.6 per cent of the vote, while former Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic &aposs party, G17 Plus, will vote by 5.2 per cent.
Meanwhile, various parties that have cleared ethnic minorities are expected to overcome the parliamentary barrier.
When the three balances are such as democratic parties, the Radikal and Socialist parties are based on the chance to form a coalition with all representatives who go to parliament.
The Democrats established a coalition with the regional Bosniak party Sandzak Democratic Party in Serbia to strengthen their position.
The DPS, meanwhile, was created with various regional parties in central Serbia.
These elections have taken action to support international community democratic parties, as a potential importance.
The UN special representative for the Kosovo status, Martti Ahtisaari, postponed the announcement of the status decision as early as elections.
According to many Western analysts and media resources, Ahtisaari is the basis of a proposal for Kosovo.
This could cause a decision to postpone its plans for the future, even though political incidents and innocent in Serbia.
Meanwhile, the EU gives various signals to Serbia.
Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug said the details of an official document drafted by the EU presidency Finland would be given a clear message on Serbian citizens' chances for European integration in the coming days.
Serbia was invited at a summit in Riga last week. [Getty Images]
The document envisions that political and economic leaders meet more intensified, accelerating talks on visa benefits and the implementation of financing programmes used by EU pre-accession funds, and to strengthen relations between the EU and Belgrade.
Another development is also the NATO summit in Riga -- Serbia -- and the former state union partner in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) -- was the first step towards membership in the Alliance.
Furthermore, co-operation with The Hague and extradition of Mladic to the tribunal, especially in particular, the conditions for the programme have been clear for years.
This serious policy change, which has dropped UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, is a key message that the West is concerned about the democratic process in Serbia.
Reform politicians have cautioned several times that the political future of the country will not be internal open if foreign politics are constantly negative developments.
The international community is considered such warnings.
With the election date, Tadic said on January 21st that Serbia will choose an election between a European future and the Milosevic era "very far" between the Milosevic era. "I hope that the democratic forces and a single target will win the elections -- a church policy that would improve the standard of living -- the EU and citizens," he said.
Following more than two months, Serbian voters will show that Tadic is unfair.
And all the world will be on them.

In addition to more than 100 page documents from the Orijinal requested, Belgrade has also provided many other materials, including bags of the laws indicted by this time.
Milenkovic, 34-year-old Milenkovic, said he wants to prove and evidence of crimes, and did not use the right to the Greek court decision.
It was not clear that the name will happen at the time.
According to the AFP, the priority must be approved by Greek Justice Minister Anastassios Papaliguras.
After returning to Serbia, Milenkovic is expected to face a special organised crime court, charging suspects in the Djindjic assassination case.
Milenkovic, known as Bugsy, is one of the 13 words and paramilitarian officers, charged with Serbia in the murder of the first elected prime minister since World War II.
Serbian prosecutors say he is a member of the Zemun Clan organised crime organisation, believed to be organised by the Djindjic assassination.
Three suspects are being tried at the special court in Belgrade, including Zvezdan Jovanovic, believed to have been killed.
Milorad Lukovic, allegedly a former paramilitary commander and the assassination plan, surrendered police in May about five months after the tribunal began.
Djindjic was killed on March 12th, when the Serbian government was killed in front of the Serbian government building.
Milenkovic is also the top suspect of a successful assassination initiative in Djindjic on February 21st 2003.
In the wake of the concept that Zanlin 'management, the municipality was on the ground, and the prime minister was unable to repeat the architecture.
Milenkovic was released shortly after his arrest, and then discovered the losses.
Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojovic, who connected the failure of the extraditions, said Milenkovic would likely be postponed in a bid to "defend the defence authorities".
According to Serbian officials, the goal of the Djindjic assassination is the pro-Western government of Serbia and withdrawal of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to power.
Djindjic, who played a prominent role in Milosevic in The Hague, asked Serbia to improve co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal and to block organised crime in his country.
Bulgarian Authorities Says Tax Foundation
Although the monthly income in Bulgaria is only 100 euros, Sofia and other cities have become the last model of cars and luxury civilians.
The aircraft between the revenues and a very peaceful presence has led to the way of control within the country.

In a recent press conference, Bulgarian Tai Popov announced some details of tax evasion.
In April, a series of control of the 62 textiles, only 14 per cent of the most prominent citizens' assets have prompted their assets to tax officials.
As a result, unpaid taxes cost 3m euros to Bulgaria, or 30,000 euros per tax smuggling.
Three years ago, authorities launched two similar operations, "Sivrisis Operation".
Amac has met true assets with prominent materials.
Authorities are aiming to provide all separate clubs over 50,000 euros from 30,000 euros to textile all luxuries.
More than 200 prominent Bulgarian citizens have been elected for experience, but the number was reduced to 1200 due to budget restrictions.
According to Popov, the investigations were faced with dramatically combating and tax evasion.
In a case, the 1500m square metres of a family with one of the most luxury mafia in Sofia was unearthed any revenue.
Another however, the owner of a luxury house was stopped in the spring of a property treasure.
The luxury cars, meanwhile, are registered by Germany or Austria to pay taxes from their owners.
His deputy, Valentin Vidolov, told reporters that the ongoing Sivinek operation has worked on ten tax inspectors, and that more than 1,000 luxury homes and agencies have created a portfolio.
Most of them are businessmen and state officers.
Financial inspectors are planning to instigate their separate clubs in other countries, after this "hidden millions" assume their assets ".
This still seems to be a clearly hope.
In addition to its operations, transparency and independent control are not independent because of their charges against him.
One of the reasons for this reason is that tax officials have corruption within themselves. In a recent survey on 699, 699 of the 28th urgent tax directorate, the participants have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly insisted that 70 per cent of the participants were smaller bribers.
Overall, tax officers have confirmed the current overall channel that they are unprecedented to corruption.
Although authorities are approaching the issue, the financial inspectors are simply working with low fees and are often impressive pressure to accept money or monopoly.
If Tax officials do not submit the cases to prosecution in the coming months, "the Sivrisis Operation" is a small smaller smaller.

The Macedonian Agriculture Ministry has drafted a strategy for agriculture and food sectors as part of preparations for the country 'final EU membership.
The government says amendments to agricultural policies, institutions and regulations will be implemented by September.
"The strategy is based on three basic discovers: not invested in the agriculture sector, not in the existing conditions, it does not recognise legal regulations in the EU regulations model, and to hold talks with the EU," Agriculture Minister Slavko Petrov said.
"This document is very important because we showed that about 60 per cent of the reforms in the agriculture sector during the transition period of EU members show that reforms are in the agricultural sector," Petrov said.
According to officials, the total transition process in Macedonia has led to negative consequences on the agricultural sector.
The strategy aims to improve the negative situation in the Macedonian agriculture sector, through improving better education for farmers, improving competitiveness and allowing the state to provide more resources in the agriculture sector.
The strategy also proposed direct subsidies to some scandals.
"We should not allow a reputable agricultural products, and we need to protect the city with the development of production and environmental protection," Petrov said.
Macedonia must be revised to prepare a major elimination to open borders under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU and prepare for the effects of customs obstacles.
As a result of these changes, the government warns that Macedonian products will remain more tough competition.
"Although the EU has been recognised since long, the agricultural sector should take effectively and effectively," Petrov said. "This could have the right for the English Agriculture Policy, which has a total of 43m euros in the agriculture sector, which has a total of 50 per cent of the EU budget."

The long-standing dispute on the name of Macedonia has not been blocking the border with thousands of Greeks.

Despite the crowd of political relations between Athens and Skopje, citizens who live in the north of Greece are putting the border facility to find more cheaper treatment, as well as other goods and services.
Despite the two Balkan neighbours "Macedonia" disputes because of its name, it was not an obstacle to the executive economic diplomacy in his own country.
According to Greek literatures, the private clinics have dropped by 50% in the job, due to "rivers" from Bitola, Gevgelija or Strumica.
It is a growing factor that opposes the impact of the economic crisis.
Of course, there is no matter.
Many people come to cheaper gas or dynamic.
Speaking to SETimes, a customs officer told SETimes that the average of 1,000 Greek citizens from the Evzoni border crossings every week, while the number of last week was doubled.
"Nini Gevgelija [is] a sculpture in the north of the border," Memur said, referring to one of the many things in the north.
The average of 500 Greeks have already been closed from the Nucasus border crossing, he added.
Giorgos Xanthopoulos, the head of the Florina diagnoses, has been a literature for 27 years.
Xanthopoulos said the incident began after 2000, when local residents began to Bitola, 24km from the spot.
"The economic crisis in Greece and in particular, in particular, the discovery of the state, is spread for the low prices," Xanthopoulos told SETimes.
Many citizens who live in Florina said they are the average of the medical funds, including the State Energy Authorities' major functioning force.
However, the fon has been simply in 1994 to prices.
Xanthopoulos said the state fund has allocated about 50 euros, but the state funds pays only 7 euros to couples.
In Bitola, the same action is about 15 euros.
At the same time, a protocol is 1,000 to 1,200 euros in Florina and King, while Bitola could be low by 300 euros.
A prominent cancer service is estimated at 20 euros, but a Greek architecture has allocated at least 150 euros for this.
Xanthopoulos said the number of tourists who have not been part of this insurance was "among the Florines that are" between at least and spot ".
Foreign doctors are unable to write the opening of local funds or exercise the opening of local funds, vehicles or other diagnoses.
Karambos Jakovidis, the head of the principles' colleagues, is reviewing his colleagues.
Jakovidis said the issue has already made three television interviews on the issue, and acknowledges that the jobs are really declined due to low prices in other areas.
"People live in the border with organised buses, as well as the coast.
The effect of this is 50% or more, "he said.
However, both diagnoses insist that the facilities are better in Greece, and Greek bridges insist they are more experienced.
"There is an idea of the cigarettes here, but in neighbouring neighbouring country, which does not have to comply with EU rules and regulations," Xanthopoulos said.
However, Xanthopoulos acknowledges that the overall life of life in Bitola is low than Florina.
"Therefore, there is a reason for organised crime in the army, because there are many people who live in the Bitola region," he said.
Aleksandar Ivanovski, owner of the Estadak city clinic in Bitola, told SETimes that Greeks' work has created a large part of the work of the medical visitors, and donates "the quality of services, lower prices and the integrated economic crisis in Greece".
Bosnia and Herzegovina Education Reforms
Education reform says more than 200 companies working under the OSCE supervision are now a comprehensive effort for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 06 / 01 / 03
The six-pilot school in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is participating in a project used by Internet teachers.
A primary school in Tuzla is being implemented in a programme that teachers met with teachers' plan.
A primary school in Mostar was formed by the Ev and Okul Union, which will provide communication with the school.
These are some of the beginning of a comprehensive education reform, which aims to take place in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In the country, the schools and 13 separate education ministries and 13 separate education ministries are now interested in the OSCE supervision, which are now interested in problems with the presence of the OSCE.
OSCE and local education officials have managed to open a broad education reform in Brussels in November to the agenda of the Peace Implementation Council.
"This is an extraordinary development, the entire ministries of ministries and units for education in Bosnia and Herzegovina," said Jo-Anne Bishop, an OSCE adviser to the fight against discrimination and communication, adding that 80 per cent of the working groups will be created from Bosniaks.
One of the groups involved in education in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the European Commission (EC), which has since 19.3m euros in the country since 1996, is the European Commission (EC) (EC). In 2002, it was working to work on a series of workers, representatives and ministries of the Education Reform Project, in a bid to reform the first and medium education.
A report by the OSCE, drafted by the work, has made many restrictions.
Among the recommendations, EC Social Union Executive Director Yadranka Rurovic said that the fundamental education has been included in nine years, allowing teachers to teachers to teachers to lose more modern methods, while schools' governments should be managed to be managing, and the fundamental training of private children (free).
"These are very general recommendations, because there is a long process that will not be completed in a year," Yadranka said.
Bosnia and Herzegovina - Roams, Hungarians, Czech and Ukrainians -- have also discussed the problems of minority groups that have recently worked in a shooting at the European Centre for Reconstruction in Sarajevo.
Ivan Bluk, who represents a Ukraine company in Banja Luka, said the group has decided to bring its own language professional professional professional for children in Pirnsor, and that solution could be a method that will be addressed by all minority students in the country.
"We are doing our job, with our own initiative, we do not expect the international community or other officials to wait," he said.

Analysts say NATO participation in the missile defence system has increased its role.
By Paul Ciocoiu for Southeast European Times in Bucharest -- 15 / 09 / 11

Romania and the United States signed a missile defence agreement on Tuesday (September 13th) during Romanian President Traian Basescu ’ s visit to Washington.
The agreement is being taken as a key security force in Bucharest.
The agreement was signed by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Romanian counterpart, Foreign Minister Teodor Baconschi.
"When the agreement is approved, the United States will protect all the paper, and will establish a card Aegis Balisk Defence system in Romania, which will improve the security of the United States," Clinton said. "We expect the Romanian parliament and its support to complete the second phase of the European missile system in four years," he added. "
"Our agreement we have not been able to replace Romania in a central position in the development of NATO," Clinton added.
The two countries discussed the establishment of the system in October 2009, when US Vice President Joe Biden visited Bucharest.
In February 2010, Washington invited Bucharest as an official invitation to participate in the missile shield, citing the SM-3 type weapons on its territory.
Following the seven round of talks on the US military base, the agreement was the latest in June 2011.
President Basescu stressed the importance of the agreement on the public.
"The agreement will be the highest point of Romania in the history of the country," Basescu said.
After consultations with the State Department, he also promised that the agreement would be published after consultations with the State Department.
"I want to eliminate any speculation on our free issues.
It is the obligation of the Romanian state, "he said.
At the visit, Basescu and US President Barack Obama signed a 21st century Strategic Partnership for Strategic Information.
Political commentators in Romania said the country will become more prepared for the security threats this day.
"This is a very important security level in Romania, when the US-Romania Movement Defence Agreement has made Romania in its history," Cristian Cambianu, external news agency Romania Libera, told SETimes.
"The two countries have been transferred to the next level of co-operation, which has so far achieved bilateral relations, with the exchange of military intelligence -- which has made bilateral relations," he added.
Florin Ciornei, head of the daily Evenimentul Ziri, who was accompanied by Basescu, sees other benefits.
"Before everything, this agreement has been eliminated by the Eastern Europe 'Obama Government," Ciornei told SETimes.
"First, even among the European states that serve Romania in the Black Sea and the rest of the system are more geopolitical," Ciornei said. "Romania is taking a major role in the southeast of NATO."
"In terms of the absence of public opinion, President Obama has made it clear that Romania would support the amendment of a legislation that would allow Romania to participate in the visa liberalisation programme," Ciornei said, referring to the Roma who have been waiting for years.
Freedom Freedom in the Balkans:
Most of the countries in Southeast Europe are among the first 45 countries in the world that have recently broadcast freedom of press freedom in the world.
(Novini.com - 25 / 10 / 02; RFE / RL - 24 / 10 / 02; Journalists, BBC - 23 / 10 / 02)
Most of the countries in Southeast Europe are among the first 45 countries in the world that have recently broadcast press freedom in the world, which has been broadcast in the first time.
It aims to be ranked by 139 countries, according to the respect of press freedom.
One of the consequences of the research that envisions the reveal is that media freedom -- not in a country with democratic ways -- is direct links to a country, but also with a democratic interest.
The announcement was created by journalists, researchers, researchers and legal experts -- the arrest and murder of journalists, censorship, state monitoring, legal borders and media regulations.
The countries that have not been able to provide safe information have been removed.
Albania and Macedonia from Southeast Europe are also part of these countries.
Finland, Iceland, Norway and the Netherlands share the first ranking in the rankings, while Turkmenia, Burgas, China, and North Korea are also in the late.
The worst situation in these countries, according to the NGO report, "there is no presence of freedom of press freedom and there is no other independent newspaper." In many cases, independent journalist officials have been constant in prison and punished, while foreign media have been punished to proceed or not to proceed.
Among Southeast European countries, Greece, the United States and Hong Kong won the highest degree, while Croatia took 33 after Namisia and Paraguj.
Bulgaria is ranked 38th, with Mauritius and Peru. Following Czech Republic and Argentina, the Czech Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has two amendments from Romania, after MP.
After Yugoslav Comoros and Gabon, it can only be 60th, while Kyrgyzstan and Jordan are in front of Turkey, which is 99th after Kyrgyzstan and Jordan.
The Turkish Government efforts to reform, but most of the journalists in the country are still sent to prison, the NGO said in a report.
Furthermore, media freedom is in particular worse in the southeast of the country.
Among other EU candidates, Slovenia is also worried.
This country ranks 14th place after France, Austria and Belgium, while Kosta Rica, Switzerland and the United States.
Italy, a EU member, came in 40th, after Bulgaria fails to get two.
"We are even in the European Union, even in the media freedom of expression.
Yani says these violations are not only in the countries where we have violations, but in Italy, as many of the forests are not expected to take place, "he said.
The situation in Asia is particularly poor and no Arab country has not been among the first 50 countries, the report said. In the 130th place, Iraq and 126th, the state is in Syria to maintain the media and to pull optimism.

Roma NGOs in Macedonia are under a campaign aimed at boosting the number of Roma children from school.
The UNICEF supported campaign was implemented in the cities of the Roma population, such as Skopje, Kumanovo, Prilep and Stip.
"Each Roman Children [School]."
Roma children face various obstacles in school life.
According to the National Roman Centre, about 2,000 children who need to start the first class on September 1st failed to do so because their families are not the money.
In many cases, children and their parents were not determined whether they have the right to be Macedonian citizens and have free education.
Okul managers say there is no reason for those who have violated the law without citizens' evidence.
Another problem is the school of Roma children.
The situation, however, is that the parents' paramilitaries and other material materials for school.
Apart from this, 12 or 13 are obstacles to school.
While 72% of Roma children have been able to complete the primary school, the rate has dropped to 31% after 15.
Benzer conditions are applied in all Southeast Europe.
The rate of Roma in the region has dropped by 20% to 30% to 30% compared to Roma children, while school rates are more than two times higher.
A UNICEF and the World Bank survey conducted in 2000 found that men were better education with women.
Only 21% of women gave their schools, while men were 44%.
The problem is not free to the Balkans.
Roman children do not have equal access to education opportunities in EU member states, according to a survey by the Vienna European Organisation for Organisation and Foreign Policy in August.
Some 12-15m Roma live in Europe, the study said, while 79 million people live in EU member states.
This is the biggest ethnic minority on them.
Meanwhile, a new UNDP report found that Roma are among the most factors in the Balkans, and Roma houses were poverty in 44% of poverty.
Three% of them live in extremely poverty.
The UNDP said that the Roma in Macedonia have the highest unemployment scale (70%), and 22% face dangerous danger of health care because they do not have the necessary documents.

"The military and the civil control mechanisms on military structure are insufficient," Ashdown said after a meeting with EU and NATO officials.
"Now the soldiers have been under control of civilians and also need to strengthen customs with the control of the border," Ashdown said.
Ashdown &aposs deputy, Donald Hays, said the sale of weapons is meant to violate agreements with the UN, OSCE and other international organisations.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina will be held in charge, and it is Bosnia and Herzegovina that needs to do so," Hays said.

The EU justice and interior ministers, who pledged to boost co-operation in the fight against terrorism, agreed on Wednesday (July 13th) on broad measures to be approved by December 13th.
In an initiative by the British EU presidency, 25 ministers gathered in Brussels for talks on July 7th, six days after the attacks in London and at least 52 people live.
"We are determined to speed up our work to bring terrorism more," said British Interior Minister Charles Clarler, who heads the health situation meeting.
The four pages adopted on Wednesday said the terrorists are "an emergency priority" to restrict the plans, restricting support networks, sparking money resources and create an EU framework that would ensure the impression and investigation of terrorists to justice.
The Framework, New York and Washington will be formed on the current plans adopted after 11 September attacks and attacks in Madrid in 2004.
EU Justice and Interior Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the implementation of anti-terrorism measures made after the Madrid attacks was slowly slow than EU officials expect.
"It is time to simple and beach beaches," the AP quoted Frattini as telling reporters in Brussels. "We are not willing to make a very quickly progress and prove that we are ready to prove the public and terrorists."

Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said on Sunday (March 8th) that the Serbian government is now awaiting for a long-debated discrimination law to be passed by the end of April.
The law enforcement is one of the requirements for Serbia to enter the Schengen summer list, which would allow Serbian citizens to travel to EU member states.
The ruling European Serbian party is preparing to support the bill by banning "important changes" at the parliamentary group for Serbia, the daily Blic reported on March 10th.
However, the newspaper said the government will not send controversial sections by the Serbian Orthodox Church on 10 March without debate in parliament.
The government adopted the bill late last month, but representatives of the "traditional" Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Muslim, Evanjelist and other allies are opposed to the 21st Madde, which guarantees freedom of discrimination based on sexual trend.
Following that, the government dismissed the bill from the parliamentary agenda.
NGOs described the law as ancient democratic.
"I am convinced that I will have to question different churches in the law," said Labour and Social Policy Minister Rasim Ljajic.
Ljajic said the bill was decided to withdraw from the parliamentary agenda, and nobody has no information on the government television conference.
According to the study and social policy ministry, the most discriminated group in Serbia has created Roma, while inequality and obstacles are affected by women and obstacles.
The discrimination against Roma is the most frequent because of the population does not have ID documents.
The Roma are mostly pushing their education rights and they do not have access to health insurance or aid payments.
The bill is defined special and general discrimination cases and envisions a representative for the protection of equality, if citizens can be cleared if they are discriminated.
This representative will be able to warn violations or launch legal function on judges.
Due to the economic crisis, the representative will not start until early 2010.
So far, citizens can start legal functioning if the law is implemented.
The law covers nationalism, dynamic and lives, as well as discrimination on the differences of gender differences.
The penalties for discrimination will be changed between 53 and 1,056 euros, based on whether the perpetrators cannot repeat it.
Serbia is still the only country in Europe without sexual equality.

"We have the right to live, after we have to live better," said Srebrenica Mayor Abkman Malkic. "This facility opened the doors of agricultural production, especially in the health food production."
The municipality, who is willing to attract investments from one of the poorest war zones in BiH, has shifted the factory, which will provide about 30 people.
The amount of textbooks has been on here and has increased since the battle does not have the industrial economy in the region, Bos Agro Food seems to buy about 1,500 smaller farmers in this year and seem to sell up to 1,000 tonnes.
The company will be sold to Sandinav countries and central Europe.
"Our goal is to help the couple of farmers.
How can you do this, and how much can you do what they can do so? "he said.
The farmers who assist the job are Muslims who have returned to the region among the farmers who are helping the region.
As of last year, the three municipalities in the region have returned to 3,000 Muslims and these are smaller farmers.
The targets are to make it more people who want to return to this goal, said Be Svensson General Armenson Grayoc.
The company hopes that the first investment would encourage others to follow.
Authorities said a foreign car producer is interested in neighbouring the neighbourhood, and Bosnian companies hope to open media factories in the region.
The head of the Office of the High Representative, the head of the economy department, said the business model would be functioning, and said they would "give their efforts".
"Currently, a different market of Swedish investor (organiser) has been destroyed, and it is true to producer consumption," Patrice Dreiski said. "Economic situation is not changed.
"I have developed, but it will create conditions for more success."
Troika member: Kosovo division could be an option.

"If both sides repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly, prospects for reconciliation or bridge," EU representative Wolfgang Ischinger said. [Getty Images]
Following a new round of talks between Belgrade and Pristina, the EU representative of the international troika said on Sunday (August 12th) that the division of Kosovo could be part of a solution to the province ’ s final status.
West and Russia have dismissed the possibility of division between ethnic communities in the province, citing the fear that the Balkans can encourage separate peaceful movements outside the Balkans.
However, EU representative Wolfgang Ischinger told reporters that the troika would ratify any agreement between ethnic Albanians and Serbs and nothing.
"We are urging both sides to be broad.
Both have declined to build a compromise or bridge, "he said.
The Contact Group -- Ischinger, US representative Frank Wisner and Russian member Aleksander Botsan-Karenko -- were in Belgrade and Pristina at the weekend.
Three diplomats met with local leaders to decide how to continue the new round of talks by the six-member Contact Group, which will be held by US, Russian, Germany, France, British and Italian representatives.
Ischinger said the negotiators plan to begin talks as soon as possible.
The next meeting with officials could take place at the end of the month.
Following a visit to Belgrade on Friday, Ischinger said the troika should submit its report to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon by December 10th.
However, he said, this is not the time for the completion of the talks.
According to Wisner, the tripartite, Serbs and Albanians have learned their goals and platform for the future.
"There is another situation.
The peace is important and we all have a donation. "
"We have announced our mandate, we have a candidate to open the way for status.
We will accept any solution accepted by the weeks, "Wisner said, adding that the troika does not go to Pristina to propose proposals.
"In the coming months, we will work closely in effectively," he said, calling for a compromise between the parties.
After the meeting, Serbian President Boris Tadic said the new talks would open the way for a compromise solution to both sides, which should be approved by the UN Security Council.
Both Serbian and Russia say the new consensus "should not be based on the plan of former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari" because the Security Council success.
After nearly a year of results, negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina presented in March that Ahtisaari would select supervised independence for Kosovo, which 90% of the population of the UN Security Council.
Pristina and Western countries have accepted the plan, but the proposal was rejected by Belgrade and Russia.
After Russia blocked its cabinet at the Security Council, the new talks were transferred to the Contact Group, after the plan blocked.
Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu said that independence, territorial integrity and the Ahtisaari package is not the market.
"Independent people of Kosovo are political will and there is no negotiation," the province leaders said.
"The territorial integrity of Kosovo is not immunity and the negotiation cannot be a market."
"The Kosovo delegation said it is determined to continue co-operation with Troyka, which is only 120 days, with Troyka," Sejdiu said, adding that Kosovo authorities will demonstrate a constructive co-operation in the talks.
Bulgarian tourism sector faces possible negative impact on extremism
The head of the Bulgarian tourism agency, will face bankruptcy dangers next year.
(Dnevnik, Sofia Echo - 13 / 08 / 07; Deutsche Welle, Sofia News Agency - 12 / 08 / 07; Sofia Echo - 06 / 08 / 07; Sofia News Agency - 27 / 07 / 07; Mediapool - 26 / 07 / 07)
Tourism annually enjoys 2 billion euros, about half of the Bulgarian trade deficit. [Getty Images]
In recent years, the construction of Bulgaria during the Black Sea coastal coastal coast has been caused to seek many hotels, while many hotels are stopping at the summit.
The country is only one of the problems facing the tourism industry, the German Deutsche Welle said in a report on Sunday (August 12th).
Marin Neskov, a Bulgarian tourism expert who lives in the north of the Black Sea, told the German media website that hotels, barricades and other tourist facilities have spent millions of euros, but the necessary infrastructure is spent.
Adny Black, a resort resort in the 35km north of Burgas, for instance, has been expansion of Bulgaria in its market economy, and now has more than 200 hotels, mostly a luxury.
However, the transportation and telecommunications networks are convinced.
Neskov says the water supplies and cancer supplies are insufficient.
According to Deutsche Welle, tourism is 2m euros annually, with nearly half of Bulgaria ’ s trade deficit.
According to the head of the Bulgarian tourism agency, however, the number of foreign tourists from the country has dropped.
The revenue from international tourism between January and May of this year was around 532m euros, according to the same period of 2006, the head of the State Tourism Agency (DTD), Anelia Krubkova, said on July 26th.
However, he said, the number of foreign tourists has dropped in the same five months after concrete growth.
The rise of the survey in the Black Sea coastal coastal coastal has led to competitiveness in unprecedented levels, he said.
With the decline of foreign tourists, many hotel owners had to reduce prices last month.
In addition, there are still many theatre in sea hotels that are not interethnic.
According to Krubkova, the construction of the coastal coastal coastal coastline has negative on about 50 per cent of the hotels outside the region.
The lack of holiday holidays could lead to bankruptcy next year, he said, because many of the hotel owners do not pay a large amount of debts.
Bulgarian citizens are increasingly leaving their holiday resorts in neighbouring countries, while hotel owners have been recommended to reduce prices for domestic tourists, not only to attract more clients.
The lack of insufficient number of specialists is another problem for Bulgarian tourism.
The hotels are doing so easy, and unrest are not able to be quickly education.
In addition, many students are abroad to work in the tourism sector, instead of being abroad.
"Tourism rates the lowest average salary in Bulgaria," Neskov Deutsche Welle told SETimes. "Tourism is 14% of the country 'diverse circumstances, while the situation is not going to think."

The Roma community remains the basis for Macedonia and other areas, he said.
The Roma, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Spain and Turkey are the most crowded minority in Europe.
The number of Roma in Macedonia is 53,000 people, or 2.6% of the total population, but they are recognised as a different ethnic society in the process of the constitution.
The first Roma municipality of Europe and the Roma live in the world is the first maximum in the world, the Shuto Orizil mafia of Skopje.
The system, including the problems of Macedonia -- the Roma alpham, word and the Roma alcohol -- should be taken into the world, the world 'prominent singer EsRexhepova told SETimes.
"It was the first to say that the Roma songs" have been recognised as "the beautiful", he was published by Skopje Radio and his support, "Rexhepova said.
One of the problems Macedonia has taken over the ten Year presidency, and some citizens -- the majority of the Roma - have requested asylum seekers from the EU.
Following a solution to asylum problems, the government has taken various employment and social support measures, following a final recommendations that Macedonia will be removed to the visa-free status of Macedonia, if the EU has been tightened.
The number of asylum applications for asylum has dropped from 400,000 to 500 this year, according to Belgium 'Ministry of Government and Saster data released last month.
However, the Macedonian NGO sector, Osmanovski, says the ten Year has not made significant progress.
Omanovski said the ten Year participants were the action plan, noting that the participation of the ten Youth countries.
"The problem under the contract of ten Youth is that a national co-ordination and an enforcement agency is not the same.
I recommend that these will be unification, because the co-ordinator should be a Deputy Prime Minister, for example, a Deputy Prime Minister, for example, for example, for example, for example, Roma problems.
The head of Macedonia &aposs presidency did not express many things for the Roma because they do not know the basic targets and results of the ten Year, he said.
"The Roma still have a low level of education, poor and discrimination, and they are now seeking a role in initiatives to ensure the NGOs' prosperity," Osmanovski said.
These include increasing the number of Roma students who are not registered to universities and improving their motivation.
"The Macedonian government should continue to support these initiatives," he adds.

Many Serbian, Western Europe or the United States have been leaving their country to achieve a better future, while a Parisian France was left to Zelizac, a Belgrade Freedom of Freedom.
Karl Haudburg has been in force over the past two years, with a medieval era from the medieval era in Belgrade.
Danube, eight, is accompanied by a small scoter.
"In France, people in France know little about Serbia, and most of them have negative losses to the war.
"I want to improve the truth of the Serbian image, not something else, but in Belgrade, I want to see the truth of the people who live in the Serbian people," he said.
Haudburg, who visited the web site every day, says most visitors are from the United States.
Over 30 per cent of the areas are Serbia and others from Russia and the EU.
The Serbs have to respond to many preventions, Haudburg says.
"People do not know whether Belgrade is a safe part of the security, but the war is not bigger and should see if it comes to Belgrade.
Do Hatta has electricity and Internet in Serbia? How do you face conservative questions such as the Serbs?
Such questionnaire questioned how much work should be done to change the image of Serbia.
I do not think that this image can be changed, "he said.
Haudburg, who arrived in Belgrade in 2009 with his daughter, was formed by a Facebook group, a website of Serbian Ambassador to World (http / ww.am.com), a website of more than 30,000 members and more than 30,000 members.

I am doing Serbia and I choose to fight him, "he said.
In 2002, Haudburg said there was a precedent on a documentary that was monitored in France television, adding that he had had a opportunity to go to Belgrade three years later.
"If you go to Serbia, what will you flee the Academy of My?" he said.
I reiterated that I want to live in Belgrade.
I had a minimum stake in Belgrade, such as life in the previous life, and I have no loss. "
"It is a difficult situation for the Serbian people, since one of the other is in Serbia," Belgrade journalist Mirjana Pantic said.
We are exaggerating the United States or France to stay and decide to live and live, but we are not exaggerated to Serbia with the same time.
We are not positive about the country that we live. "
Jovan Ristic, an author of Belgrade scientific, respects Haudburg 'efforts.
"I am convinced that the state should support the work of Haudburg and not contribute to many different operations to this study, and I would not stop negative negative in the overall time," the state said.

As Iraq won stability, bilateral relations will open a new border crossings with Turkey.
Business organisations are very easy about the issue.
However, certain problems have not been resolved.
"We are negotiating with Iraq authorities on the new border crossings with Iraq for nearly a year," said Ramadan Ion, a representative of the Turkish Customs Directorate. "We must expect the talks to be completed.
The ceremony of the Temel will take place in two or three months. "
They are now discussing the door, and both have been focused on the Supreme and Sinava, one of the southeastern town of Sinava.
Iraq was the biggest fifth export market in 2010 after Turkey, Germany, Britain, Italy and France.
Turkish exports to Iraq increased more than 36m last year, according to data from the Turkish Foreign Trade Directorate.
Meanwhile, Iraq exports to Turkey rose from 84 million to 1.4 billion in the same period.
"A second border checkpoint is essential to harm the existence of the Commerce Charter, which is limited to the trade," Gaziantep Trade Chamber President Mehmet Aslan told SETimes.
Even after the opening of the second border cross-border crossings, Alan said, Turkey has exported to Iraq, adding that exports will likely increase.
"Furthermore, trade with the region can be able to increase trade with the countries.
Therefore, we can become a regional power, "he said.
According to the head of the Gaziantel Organisation of Industry and the head of the Nakpop Holding, a smuggling company with Iraq, the head of the manager of the Nakhl Nakiboglu District, who is a commercial company with Iraq, has to wait for 15 days, so Turkish firms have to pay for such delays.
"I will not use the second border crossing.
Even if a third border crossings, we would be good for our jobs, "he said, adding that Turkey expects exports to Iraq as long as the restructuring in Iraq continues.
Turkey and Iraq have said the trade acceleration between Turkey and Iraq will be reached by the end of 2011, Turkish Cafat Hisarcisioglu, who said that target would achieve a 10 billion by the end of 2011, followed a meeting with the Federation of Iraq Chamber of Commerce President Cafer Cafer Hami Square in Istanbul in June.
However, the head of the Turkish Economic Relations Council (DEIK) in Turkey, Erchaly Medisoy, said there are problems that must be resolved before more homes.
"Authorities are intended to open a second border cross-border crossing with Turkey to Egypt, but Turkey is not the current infrastructure," he said.
Since 1984, more than 90 per cent of Turkish farmers have been transferred to staff because of security reasons for the border, he said.
"There is a safe system that businessmen can be able to use a second border crossings at the beginning."
Following the second border crossings returned to Iraq, the trade between the two countries could affect the business activities in the Kurdistan province, according to Medisoy.
"The transport and insurance companies in northern Iraq have serious business with Turkish trucks.
They will not want to give up it, "he said.

He argued that at least five women were killed in Turkey every day and women were represented in parliamentary and authority positions. Women Platppu argues the name change has sent a wrong message.
Turkey is close to world standards in terms of poverty, education and women, the organisation added.
In addition to these conditions, the government needs a ministerial ministry on women problems, he argues.
Tourist political scientists at the Ankara Centre for Women Studies are more optimistic.

High Representative Christian Schwarz-Schilling, who arrived at the end of his mandate, has ordered European authority to the worst atrocities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) since World War II.
Schwarz-Schilling intervened after the BiH Parliament failed to do so, due to the lack of the Bosnian Serb prime minister.
"This law does not think that this law does not allow it to be removed because of the mistakes in parliament," Schwarz-Schilling said on Monday (June 25th).
It will now be operated by a administrative board that report to the BiH Council of Ministers.
The State Protection and Protection Agency (SIPA) will give security services.
The political leaders of Republika Srpska (RS) have been convicted.
They argue that the decision made by the envoy was disappointed by the entity and state constitutions, as well as the Dayton Peace Accords.
The RS government and parliament have asked the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) to cancel the decision.
"The RS does not debate the presence of an architecture and respect all the presence of the victims, but it cannot be a reason for the reconstruction of the entity and state territory," RS lawmakers said.
Bosnian Serb authorities have asked all institutions, particularly the police, to continue their duties on all entity territory, including the Srebrenica ica-Potocari.
In addition, many of the political parties in the Federation of BiH, the other entity, Schwarz-Schilling welcomed the decision by Schwarz-Schilling.
The move is a personal and humanitarian obligation against the Srebrenica victims and their families, said Berden Belkic, the head of the BiH Parliament.
The Office of the High Representative said the verdict was not a controversial willingness that the RS municipality would be granted special status, outside its authority.
The announcement, the agency said, does not mean the regional status of the centre, which will be managed by the state.
The dispute revealed shortly before the 12th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, which was declared genocide by the International Court of Justice.
More than 30,000 people are expected to come to the region in July 1995 to submit their food to those who disappeared.
The victims of 400 to 600 and 600 Srebrenica will also be disbursed.
RS police said the ceremony, as many years, would provide security and do not expect any inclusion.
However, Schwarz-Schilling is expected to join the SIPA to fulfil him as a result of his decision.

EU foreign ministers urged Montenegro on Monday (January 22nd) to commemorate and fight corruption in the judiciary.
The network came at a time when Montenegrin prosecutors have criticised the courts' inefficient and that they do not have the number of cases.
"The actions in the courts have been stopped because of the delays in the courts, while the decisions are not refused to take into account even without the accusations," State Prosecutor Vesna Mukica said in a 2005 report.
According to Mukica, the cases have not been linked to the end of 46.6%.
"The number of unprecedented cases were insufficient by the courts, while this is inefficient to fight crime and undermine the legal security of citizens," Mukica said in a report.
Opposition politicians have long been charging that the judges in the country have been controlled by the ruling structures since they are based on the parliamentary majority.
Judiciary representatives acknowledge the situation.
Judges argue that the authority of the judges should be taken from parliament and should be given to the new Judiciary Council.
Among other elements that damage the judiciary independence is not a separate budget and the government 'role in solving judges.
The European Commission (EC) announced its annual progress report in early November that corruption remains a widespread problem in Montenegro.
"The general legal and administrative framework has led to the fact that the state lies its ability to fight corruption," the commission said.
The EC welcomed the steps Montenegro has taken to improve the education of judges, and stressed the need for withdrawal of politics.
The appointment and fans should be based on "professional and unilateral criteria" instead of political criteria, the organisation said.
Montenegrin Constitutional Court President Ranko Vukoti acknowledges the EC recommendations.
"The current constitution of Montenegro and the new constitution did not allow the rule of law to allow the independence of the judiciary and the implementation of international standards in autonomy," Vukoti said.
"I hope that the new constitution will be the best lawyers to ensure the rights of the best lawyers, and will obtain the best legal female and other winner colleagues," Vukoti added.

The group "Because of Human Rights" in Turkey
For years, the human rights issue has been unable to leave Turkey.
We are very early to see whether the Justice and Development Party (AKP) will create a difference.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 13 / 05 / 03
The Turkish Human Rights Association (IHD) issued a new report on the human rights situation in the first three months of 2003.
According to a report on the priority idea and torture events, there is no positive development on these issues.
"We underlined the truth of this report, as it was made before," the IHR said.
"Unfortunately, we have no progress in this area.
In addition to freedom of expression, we observe that public prosecutors and judges are not interpreted in freedom of freedom, "he added.
In addition to the goal of full membership in the EU, Turkey received a safe message to improving human rights in the field of Kurdish broadcasting and education.
The coalition government, led by former Prime Minister Bent Ecevic, has made reforms last year.
Former Prime Minister Abdullah Gul has completed these reforms, saying they are critical for Turkey 'success in the EU.
However, the IHR report points out that freedom of expression still has not been made.
"The four radio stations and a local television station channel Radio Television Council have been broadcast from 180 to 180.
The six newspapers and literature were closed for 79 days, nine journalists were sentenced in prison, seven books, 17 magazines, seven vehicles and three posters were in prison, encouraging people to encourage different political groups, "he said.

In March, ten police officers were sentenced to five to ten years in prison.
Only four months after the AKP arrived in power, the government has created how the courts and how the judiciary in Turkey is very independent.
It is still too early to say.

A documentary of Croatian journalist Slaven Relja, a drug dependence on drug dependence, is the size of a documentary by Ivan Peric. [Ivo Scepanovic]
Croatian journalist Slaven Relja advocates about years of interviews under the effect of his house.
Relja, 46, was written in the cultural pages of the main newspapers, Vecernica List and Jutarnology List, 33, while everyone had returned to their destination.
The prosecution was also used and was a donation in short time.
The process has been sold for years, when it sold its friends in the job, the drug depends on drug donations, while he worked with a special community for the probe.
After several years of rehabilitation in Cenacolo social centres in Croatia and Italy, the television station Splitska Television (STV) has now taken a documentary that has been working.
Ivan Peric, a journalist of Journalists' District 'Prosecutor' (hhtttp: / www.sslja.hhr / ennovarov-ge-geroglu -- awaiting to demonstrate at the film festival.
However, Relja acknowledged his story to Southeast European Times before entering the film.
Southeast European Times: How do you decide to learn you, fear stories?
Relja is clear that he was sentenced to everything in life. [File]
Slaven Relja: It is an unwritten architecture for everyone in the Cenacolo community, for everyone who lives in the wake of the Cenacolo community.
I have decided to seek a documentary, in a proposal by the Cenacolo community, where the friends were returned to them.
Furthermore, the withdrawal of the documentary was caused to end some friendship, even the relationship of the family with some families.
This is a result of the conditions we live in the society.
However, it is impressive because I am sure that I have a good and fair job.
I see a revived entity in the true story, after a restructuring of a businessman, who was shot in a widespread and heroin.
This is the latest promise that drug has always said and do not see a sign of the claims that renewal of drug narcotics is not possible?
SETimes: What is your basic message that you want to get documentary?
Relja: I can see some of the message, but I want to say that everything that we are like drug, even if this documentary is bad, I would have a positive things.
However, we cannot see the incidents more positive.
All this traffic has always been a positive one.
It is clear that he was convicted of everything in life, but the Cenacolo Community is convinced, and I can never live in other circumstances.
I have friends from around the world, since Cenacolo is part of the international community.
"I should also say that after the bad drug use, I have begun in another way," he said.
"I have begun to make the world better in the environment after I live," he said.
Therefore, I have a message, after the decrease, a person has begun to see the world with different observers.
SETimes: How do you have the drug donation in 33 years?
Relja: The prosecution is not a protocol.
A character and wrong opinion will be represented.
If you come to the level of prosecution, the business is the past.
We are trying to solve a balance of public life, a dissatisfaction against the world, and the problem that feels an exercise of freedom, and we are trying to solve us.
I choose this way I will fight.
However, many people are preferred to drugs, instead of the closure.
SETimes: As a drug donation, how did you work for a national newspaper, how do you do you do the software?
Relja: In the first round, we are still able to protect some of the credibility before it turns into a full exercise.
I believe that I still have very good jobs.
I can convince the excavations from the beginning of the beginning of the summer.
I am doing them only with people and artists who have recognised them, but then then they had a complaint.
During the period, I have begun to receive money from friends in the business, when I need to get drug.
The Cenacolo community helped start improving Relja. [File]
SETimes: You have to participate in the Rehabilitation community and try to leave drug, or do you convince the others?
Relja: Several people will be able to do with their own request.
For me, the same amount was applied.
Prosecutor donations have refused to live and aid within the fact that they can face the problem.
I also refused to participate in the Christian communities, when you worked 16 hours a day.
I strongly opposed to participation in the Rehabilitation community, but the situation in the work and the house has forced to go to Cenacolo.
I have later rescued my life in the community.
SETimes: Do you have the worst of the war with the prosecution?
Relja: People.
I also helped the problem and leave it, but I have always won the war with drug drugs, when I started to believe.
You can think that these words are a precautionary aspect, but I really understand that you are only really.
SETimes: How do you live in the Rehabilitation centre after years of spring?
Do you have to fight people to ensure their safety?
Relja: There is no reason for this situation.
People can see whether they are good in the reality, and if they are not going to see.
Though the problems have returned to journalism, there are problems, but only those who have a limited perspective that people do not accept the right to success.
Following the prosecution, everyone in life is in the mandate of Tanrin.
I think it can play even the mountains.
SETimes: Do you expect the Belgium to help others?
Relja: I will do this job in the right direction, and I will leave the female of documentary, Tanrin and structure employees.
I am convinced that the film will be successful, because I am volunteer and one of them who helped him.

Serbian asylum seekers jeopardise visa regime
Serbia is seeking to stop asylum seekers in the scene, which is jeopardising the Schengen access.
By Biljana Pekusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade – 23 / 05 / 11
In Brussels on March 2010, asylum seekers are restored to send asylum seekers to Serbia and Macedonia. [Reuters]
Following an increase in the number of Serbian citizens seeking asylum to EU member states, Brussels has warned Belgrade that the future of visa-free travel to the Schengen zone is rising.
The visa requirement for citizens of Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro was removed in December 2009.
In the end of 12 months, 17,000 people from Serbia sought asylum to EU countries, including Sweden, Belgium and Germany.
These were the poor persons who believe that they would be easily easy with state aid in rich Western European countries.
Of them, 95% of them were injured, while the rest was the Albanian minority living in Presevo and Bujanovac, southern Serbia.
Many were victims of corruption and scandal.
"A police officer in Nis has paid 1500 euros to get a passport, because no one was a permanent house.
"Switzerland was not able to go to Switzerland," he said. "He did not get the middle.
Now, the money must be paid for debt, and police officer are not able to recognise it. "
Serbian police arrested 24 people, including 16 police colleagues, for their alleged documents to receive passports.
Prosecutors say that some of these police officers have received money by 5,000 euros for their services.
Following more than a year after the incidents of asylum seekers, Belgium sent a letter to the European Commission in recent warning that it would require a "summer Schengen" request for Serbia.
The possibility of the Serbs to lose this new freedom of expression has responded to a public response.
"We feel our European feelings in this respect, and we will still be such as their homes," Belgrade student Goran Bozinovic said.
The new law, which will bring passports to passports and travel abroad, has led to questions about deeply equal treatment and discrimination over the country.
"We should not implement conditions for the tourists and the citizens of southern Serbian poorer Albanians or other nationalists," former Justice Ministry Secretary Marko Karacic said.
Apart from this, he added, "the state should create better economic conditions and broad rights for those people to seek them in other countries."
Interior Minister Ivica Dacic also participated, saying Serbia will work more for the Chingdom minority.
"We want to give the communities to the society, so we want to work with other citizens to feel equal, and that is not a solution to them," Dacic said.
Serbia is also considering punishment of people who explore the illegal immigration organisation and exploitate people who exploitate asylum seekers in the scene, "Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said." People who have organised asylum seekers will be arrested and prosecuted. "
In addition to all border crossings, police will ask their passengers, insurance, adequate money, water and cause evidence in order to make travel.

Turkey, near the Middle East, which has a long instability and weapons of weapons, has been implemented in implementing strong arms policies.
The 10th Group (G10) -- Turkey, Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany, Meksika, the Netherlands, Poland and and the United Arab Emirates -- gathered at the end of April to encourage "to strengthen the global community" and strengthen international arms.
In front of the 2012 Armed Convention Agreement (NPT), G10 countries have adopted four concrete proposals to strengthen global arms: stopping production in accordance with the ongoing manufacturing of the Capital Treaty (CBT), transparency and accountability.
G10 also reiterated calls for the establishment of a Middle East Middle East Armenian District (MEWFZ) from the Armenians Armed Armed Armenians (MEWFZ).
According to Hadete University professor and architecture expert Shalnem Uay, Turkey "is aware of the MEFS to complete the threats from the Middle East or the nuclear status of NATO", because it is not completely reluctant to the MEast. "
"It is a security presence for the only unilateral country status, because Ankara has ordered the regime and a safe member of the international community," he told SETimes.
The initiative, however, came only 12 months before Turkey signed its first nuclear actor tender with Russia, causing some environmentals to question Turkish nuclear purposes.
Most of the hundreds are from neighbouring Iran 'tension programme, which declined to the global nuclear and armed issues.
Despite Turkish strong policies against weapons, Ankara and traditional Western allies are interpreting NPTK different comments.
"The upcoming approach of Ankara is strongly affected by the United States that it is a nuclear country and that there is no peaceful nuclear infrastructure.
At the same time, Turkey condemns the NPT "Madda IAT, which is" untest "to have nuclear energy in line with peaceful purposes of nuclear weapons," Madda said.
Turkey is worried that nuclear supplies have been blocking their own nuclear power targets to lift the broadcast of peaceful nuclear technology.
"Although Turkey is unlikely to revive commercial restructuring or restructuring facilities, the country is unlikely to allow the NPT metable of nuclear weapons and restructuring to revive a peaceful nuclear pharmaceutical and restrictions," Varnum told SETimes.
"The main concept of Turkey is to build nuclear power plants, despite the protests in the post-Fukusama posal protest," he said. [Turkey] seems to seek a international consortium. "
Turkey is working for "to convince Iran (the rest of the Middle East) and its good neighbourly relations with the rest of the Middle East, but also to" convince Iran to stay as unisolated or threaten, "he added.
The public support for Iran 'reputation programme sparked Turkey with the United States and other surveys in the United States and other countries to disaster weapons in the Middle East and cautioned such stance.
"It is very important that Turkey has not shown a strong commitment to the armed regime and the NPT process," he said.

While the authorities' revenue targets for 2010 could be a little optimistic, the IMF director said, authorities also welcomed the country 'preparation to take steps to meet the open target of 2.5% of GDP in the next year' budget.
"The banking system is very efficient and the low dependence on foreign financing," Fon said on Monday.
The IMF board also welcomed steps to strengthen the crisis mechanisms, and plans to adopt a law that allows them to intervene without the risk of intellectual banks.

IMF: global economic recovery begins
In a report on Wednesday, the IMF chief economist said the global economic crisis has left "details" to take years.
(Independent, Wall Street Journal, Finland, Nine O 'clock - 20 / 08 / 09; CNN, RFE / RL, Novinite, IMF - 19 / 08 / 09; Reuters, Bloomberg, Market Watch - 18 / 08 / 09)
IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said the world leaders must focus on ways to continue interim provisional recession. [IMF]
The global economy has begun to stop the deepest crisis in the past 60 years, IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said in a report published on Wednesday (August 19th).
He also warned, however, that the process will be slow.
"Information began.
In order to continue this, both countries and the countries will need to restore damage, "he said.
It would help restore a right restructuring of private spending in the world, he added.
With a clear increase in US exports to China and other Asian countries, the current account deficit is also needed.
The crisis, which showed the world last autumn, is unnormal, the economist said.
Therefore, the model used to understand the past crisis has not been implemented.
"The increase of profits will not be simple," he said. "Kriz details and that will affect both arbitration and request for the years."
Many countries are preparing to see increased economic growth for the next couple, he said.
This growth, however, will not be limited to reduce unemployment in the short term.
Stressing that economic revival programmes should not be implemented more than the tender, the top economist said, adding that these could be extended to structural measures aimed at limiting the future growth of "authority programmes".
"The IMF forecasts suggest that the cost of the crisis in the manufacturing data is ten times of the cost of the crisis," he said. "Therefore, the lack of power programmes could be substantially purchased to revive the pace of growth.
At the time, however, there should be no special request for financial revival. "
"In almost all countries, the crisis' costs have been created and the increase of taxes is inevitable," Blanchard said. "In all, all of course, we can be able to return to the former growth path, the pop producer will be lower than the crisis."
The IMF, based on an analysis of 88 banking crisis in various countries over the past 40 years, concludes that these are not constantly reduced by the average growth rate.
"Therefore, the world economy will probably be returned to the rise of growth in developed countries," the economist said. "But in particular developed countries, the average growth could not be translated or even more quickly."
He also stressed that the problem and risks of the crisis, as well as some of the co-operation between the countries will be crucial in the next few years.

The IMF said on Tuesday (July 27th) that precautionary wage policies are critical to continue macroeconomic stability. [AFP]
While praising Romania for its progress in the past three years on macroeconomic policies and structural reforms in the past three years, the IMF said there should be more efforts in these areas to be sustainable economic growth.
According to the IMF forecasts, Romania will increase by 4.9 per cent this year, compared to 5 per cent of GDP, compared to 4.9 per cent in 2003.
"For the sustainability of strong economic growth in the Middle East, macroeconomic stability will need to be completed and accelerate structural reform," the IMF said on Tuesday (July 27th), following consultations with Bucharest last week.
Stressing the importance of monopoly fiscal policy in years, the IMF urged the government to reduce its budget deficit in fighting inflation and to keep the current current current account deficit levels.
Romania has managed to reduce its budget deficit from 2.6 per cent in 2002 to 2.3 per cent in 2003, and IMF officials are urging GDP to keep this deficit under 2 per cent of GDP.
The inflation, meanwhile, came from 40.7 per cent in 2000 to 14.1 per cent in 2003 and is expected to drop to 9.0 per cent in 2004.
Last year, the current current account deficit deficit rose to 5.9 per cent, while loans for the private sector in January 2003 reflected a very quick increase in minimum wage.
Discussions on macroeconomic stability are critical, the IMF said, calling on officials to keep the wage rates in the division contract with the decrease growth of the division contracts.
The IMF also called on authorities to avoid more revenue increase in the minimum wage, saying it would harm the competitiveness of Romania.
In addition, the IMF also called for continuing efforts to eliminate the losses and half of the public sector.
The IMF welcomed Romania ’ s progress in privatisation in the past three years and the government plans to sell most of public enterprises, except for the energy sector by the end of 2004.
The IMF said the privatisation of the energy sector is under way, but a number of projects are closed.
The privatisation of oil and gas producer Petrom, the largest company in Romania, is particularly important.
The IMF also praised the government for recent progress in improving the business climate, including judicial reform and the implementation of anti-corruption measures.
"In order to attract more special investment, this institutional reforms, strengthening the fight against corruption -- especially in particular, to improve the independence of the judiciary and the event, and will be very important to improve transparency in privatisation and public purchases," the IMF said.
Following the IMF officials, they called on "to protect this policies in the general election competition in November and later".

In the Supreme mafia, concrete evidence in front of the Serbian government building and the weapons of weapons showed that a single type of type is. "
The lawyer of Djindjic family, Rajko Danilovic, said that "a new investigation" is unnecessary, because of all the factors showing the assassination was planning and showing it.
Addressing that the murder has not yet been known and any effort to improve the investigation should be taken to the question, Denilovic said.

"You have shown that we have achieved, the progress has been very serious economic challenges, but the problem in the same way, which is the result of the post-war generation leaders," the former ambassador said.

Last month, at least 92 people were killed in Constanta, while their actions have pushed the need for improvement of construction in Turkey.
Experts say the process depends on both new regulations and implementation of current regulations.

The death scientific death in Konya last month, when the 11-strong Zajrt rise was falling in Constanta, sparked the problem of the quality structure in Turkey.
Authorities died 92 people in the disaster, where they were charged with the quality of construction.
According to Oman Nuri Dulgers, who investigated the incident, the pharmaceutical elements are the lack of control and poor supplies.
The Turkish court accused Vedat Kay and Ismail Canaker for failing to comply with the regulations of two allies.
The construction quality of the Standards is responsible for more than 18,000 people who died in two earthquakes in Turkey in 1999, as well as the 176 victims, including a five-fixed school school in Binanl in May 2003, were responsible for the death of 84 students and a teaching teacher, including four firefighters.

The new laws, which will increase penalties to the losses that caused construction, will increase penalties.
According to the bill, authorities in charge of the control of the property and construction of construction will be held in charge of control, and could face significant prison sentences.
However, the law will be sentenced to only five years in prison, when the law has not been implemented.

If the sanctions to be implemented for these types of sanctions, our citizens will pay for their lives.
No one has no right.
We will not allow this, "he said.

War Crimes Chief Gotovina Conference
After the UN war crimes tribunal was indicted in 2001, General Ante Gotovina was revealed.
By Natasa Radic for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 12 / 06 / 03
General Ante Gotovina dismissed the two years of tolerance, giving a special interview to the editor-in-chief of the weekly Nacional.
Croatian general has lost him since June 2001, when chief UN war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte charged him with crimes allegedly committed during a operation in 1995.
Gotovina has been charged with crimes against humanitarian commander and abuse of extremist weapons against civilian targets, which cannot obtain the killings of civilians, but Gotovina was the only Croatian Croat to decide whether the war crimes tribunal does not surrender.
The Croatian government announced it would be success in the attempts to capture Gotovina, while the interior ministry announced a few weeks ago that Gotovina would be given 50,000 euros to benefit information about the ground.
For many, Gotovina is a symbolic of Croatia &aposs fight for independence.
However, the politicians' donations with the centre-right right cancelled in 2000, after he and other generals signed a letter to the Croatian Army, President Stipe Mesic.
As a top commander of the armed forces, the head of the state has agreed to accept the current generals to politics in this way, ensuring all the pension.
The latest number of Nacional associations claimed that his deepest editor, Ivo Pukanic, had met with Gotovina a few days ago.
The photographs with Pukanic and the general general are also involved in the photographs, which includes ten page interview.
Gotovina 'lawyers refused to comment on the beginning of the beginning, but some believe the interview is true.
Pukanic, who was questioned by police, suggested that protecting the news source is the legal right of journalists.
Local media include speculation that Gotovina, the most wanted indictees in Interpol, is hiding in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Canada.
In this interview, Gotovina claimed that the details were willing to meet him in 1998, when the prosecutor in The Hague had no willingness to the office.
The indictment was released shortly after that.
After two years of hiding, Gotovina has now recognised the UN tribunal and says he is ready to speak.
Meanwhile, Mesic said on Wednesday (June 11th) that the preliminary hearing of the case sends a letter to the court, which suggests that the preliminary trial would be held in Zagreb.
If del Ponte was first interpreted from the bureau, the chief prosecutor noted that Gotovina would surrender and be transferred to The Hague.

Talks on judicial reform in BiH
The talks envisions a potential damage between the High Representative and RS.
By Ljiljana Smiljanic for Southeast European Times in Banja Luka – 15 / 06 / 11
RS President Milorad Dodik met with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton in Banja Luka on 13 May. [Reuters]
During a meeting last month between Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, a possible crisis was prevented and signed an agreement on the structural dialogue that both officials agree on judicial reform would be long-term.
The restructuring process was necessary due to Dodik &aposs intention to hold a referendum on the BiH court and the prosecution 'office.
Bosnian Serbs have long criticised the current system for a process that would focus on war crimes against Serbs during the BiH conflict.
In the first round last week in Banja Luka, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fund said the entire process could be defined "more BiH in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)".
Ashton promised that a special committee would be established as a step towards restructuring.
The committee will submit recommendations on how to resolve problems in the judicial sector in line with the EU accession process.
The main goal of the dialogue is to strengthen the law and create an independent and unilateral legal system.
"This is a very serious business and representatives of the Republika Srpska have prepared a number of documents and analysts," said RS Parliament Speaker Igor Radojicic.
Radojicic expects the first day of dialogue with politicians to be held on June 6th, which would be monitored by a expert meeting.
According to High Representative and EU Special Representative Valentin Inzko, BiH has no doubt that BiH has to begin at the end of this process.
"The process, which began in BiH, is something that every country wants to become a member of the EU," Inzko said.
However, Dodik made clear that RS will not support the establishment of a Supreme Court in BiH, one of the EU proposal.
"We do not question a number of courts and prosecutors at the state level, but in every case, the law should be implemented.
We will not accept the reunification of the legal budget, such as some proposals, because it will not be affected, "he said.
"I believe we need to find a solution that meet the EU minimum standards.
On the other hand, we must be respected until the law and constitutional system is changed.
If some things need to be changed, we will not change without constitutional reforms, "he said.
However, Professor Vitomir Popovic of the Banja Luka Law, does not agree.
"This dialogue on Judiciary reform has no longer need to continue, and it will be to complete the interest of everyone, before the reform of the Bosnian institutions is discussing other questions about the work of the Bosnian institutions," he said.
European representatives said they will meet with certain proposals after every round of negotiations, but the final decision will be the Bosnian authorities.
First, a survey on the judiciary in BiH must respond until August 31st.
Turkey takes up to EU accession process
The government of Prime Minister Erdogan has established a new ministry to speed up the process.
By Mope Tokyay for Southeast European Times – 15 / 06 / 11
The progress in the EU accession process is slow. [Reuters]
At a time when the EU accession process comes to almost a stalemate point, the Turkish government hopes to establish a new ministry to restore the interior path.
The European Union will take over the co-ordination of Turkish progress in the EU integration process, currently a mandate by the state minister and chief negotiator Egemen Bagis.
The government has an ambitious goal: full compliance with the EU by the end of 2013.
According to retired ambassador Odem Arberk, one of the most experienced diplomats in Turkey, the ministry has sent a significant message from both domestic and abroad, the country remains prepared without full membership in the European Union.
"This is proof the continuation and transparency in Turkish foreign policy," he told SETimes.
In addition to the slowdown of Turkish multiethnic regional diplomacy and the slowdown on the path to the EU, EU members Germany and France have slowed fears that Turkey 'participation in the West has caused fears from Turkey.
At the same time, however, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the ruling AKP party -- are currently in power -- a number of internal problems that the EU accession process could be able to serve as an important actor.
These include a new constitution and efforts to resolve the Kurdish issue.
The new ministry will be the same level with the State Department.
The EU General Assistant Secretary of State (EUGS) has made it directly to the prime minister, while the ministry will have full responsibility for the EU port.
According to Arberk, however, the new ministry could lead to the gap between various ministries and authority centre, because the new ministry must co-ordinate the implementation of the reform process and ensure that other ministries should not meet their mandate.
"This ministry should not have a specific and authority on the ministries of ministries, which is difficult for internal policy," he said.
Kriter Karaugak, director of the general broadcaster, and owner of the Eurohorizon Adviser, believes the ministry will still try to overcome many internal obstacles on the accession process.
"It is an important step to overcome the competencies between institutions and institutions since the EUGS establishment in 2000," he told SETimes.
He argued that the State Department should continue at the level of foreign relations, arguing that EU membership should be dealt with the external and internal divisions, but also as a hardline with many of its internal divisions.
Therefore, the State Department should continue its operations in the event, and the new ministry should not enter a wrong wrong, such as the executive of the responsibility of the Foreign Minister, and should work in very close and effective co-operation and co-ordination.
Although the EU is based on its role in the internal reform process in Turkey, the internal issue and the Cyprus agenda, some question that EU membership could be on the list of priority food.
"With the election results of the AKP won on June 12th, this will decrease the new ministry to reduce its relations with the EU," Usta diplomat and CNNNTurkish diplomat adviser Yalm Eralp told SETimes.
Tourism: Albania hopes to boost growth
Despite the ongoing political tensions in the country, the tourism sector is confidence in repeating the crowd of last year.

A year after the tourism summit: Albania visited around 3.5 million tourists last year, with a 32% stake in previous years.
Authorities are waiting another recognition.
"Our observers are based on improvement in infrastructure and progress in the overall tourism sector," Endri Jorgoni, head of the Culture and Tourism Ministry, told SETimes.
"However, the political situation could be negative," he added.
The lack of infrastructure, including insufficient insufficient links to most popular documents, is one of the main problems the country is to turn its tourism potential into reality, Jorgoni said.
He added that the government wants to increase investments in the sector and is preparing a law on this direction.
Dritan Xhargo, 35, has been operating a tourist tour in Tirana for eight years.
The company offers everything to travel from scientific and packages.
"Now this year," he said, acknowledging that a complex political climate in Albania could affect the number of visitors.
Nevertheless, the sector has passed a "positive change" at the extraordinary level, he added.
Most Western tourists are learning tourists, cultural tourism and archaeological.
Most are from Britain, Italy, Finland and Denmark.
"Albania is cheaper to them," he said.
Meanwhile, the number of visitors to Albania is growing, while Albanians go abroad for their holidays.
Albania is still "exporting more tourists", he says.
Among the reasons, the level of service in Albania is relatively low and wants to see other culture in Europe.
"If you have been able to meet the quality in exchange for the money, it is more from abroad," he said.
Furthermore, Albanians preferred to travel to countries that do not need visa.
According to sources from the sector, however, visa liberalisation has changed the situation and Croatia, Greece and Spain are increasing.
Tirana Enkejda Beqo says he would select the holidays in different countries, because the new people seek to see different cultures and see rich places for history.
"At the same time, there is nothing about the resorts of the holidays … in the areas where you recognise someone, and in accordance with the quality and goods," Beqo told SETimes.
Serbia holds campaign financing
The Serbian parliament passed a law on financing of political parties, one of the requirements for EU candidate status.

Political parties need to disrupt money resources. [Reuters]
So far, Serbs have demanded that the EU would withdraw itself on the financing of political activities, which is one of the biggest corruption producers.
As a result, on Tuesday (June 14th), the Serbian parliament adopted a law that would bring them transparent and financing of political parties and allow the public parties to see money resources.
"The law envisions clear penalties for those who do not comply with the regulations," State Department Minister Milan Markovic said, adding that all parallel assistance from the parties will now be open to the public and will be held through the bank accounts.
The public will see that political parties have financed outside the state, and the parties can see how much money from private resources.
This means that parties in Serbia will be punished for the first time in parallel procedures.
Chairman of the Anti-Corruption Agency, Zorana Markovic, said new regulations on the financing of political activities are necessary because the public believes it is very corruption in this area.
"I think we can be satisfied because we are a good legal basis for transparency in this area.
"I believe that we can be able to address the financing of political parties and reduce a more realistic measure," he said.
According to the new law, illegal financing could be sentenced between three months and three years in prison.
The same sentence will also be applied for political parties to jeopardise their funding.
Zlata Djordjevic, a member of the Anti-Corruption Committee, told SETimes that the new law is important that the political parties will allow the agency to control the financial reports and maintain experience.
"The control of party activities could be very important in the fight against corruption in the political scene," Djordjevic said.
Djordjevic said the law would also block the number of parties that have been formed to get the budget for the elections only for the elections.
"All parties that are planning to participate in the elections have to pay a certain guarantee to the state budget if the party fails to win a per cent vote in the elections," the Committee said.
Nemanja Nenadic, a representative of the International Transparency Organisation of Serbia, told SETimes that "all problems will not be resolved at a moment."
"Everything is based on the control of independent state organs and their control, but it is true that they have more control.
So far, nothing has been approved that a certain party supports it, "he said.
Everybody in Serbia ’ s political life is not satisfied with the new law, but all lawmakers said the financing of all parties should be checked.
According to Miroslav Petkovic, deputy head of the opposition Democratic Party of Serbia, the new law would be more money than the parties' budget and that is unacceptable in the economic crisis.
"The law is not good, because the state resources do not apply to potential abuse for the financing of parties -- there is no experience against the possibility of the public companies to attract secret for certain parties," Petkovic said.

Bulgaria becomes a country that Greek and Romanian companies have become more preferred in recent years, due to low taxes, cheaper business force and geographical benefits.

The official statistics reveal the increase in Greek and Romanian companies' activities in the trade, industrial and services sector. [Reuters]
At the time when the economic crisis and difficult austerity measures are judging the Balkans, Bulgaria has implemented a low tax of goods, low costs.
The huge tax system is based on tax payments through a total of income or a single rate of profits.
According to official statistics, more than 2,000 Greek and 300 Romanian companies are registered in Bulgaria.
The number of Greek capital companies from the country have increased three times since 2006, the Bulgarian National Gelir Administration (NRA) said.
The biggest increase was Bulgaria 'institutions and personal income tax in 2008, when it comes to 10 per cent, and the number of registered companies rose from 619 to 1,168.
Since then, the company operations in Bulgaria have been an average of 600 companies annually.
The number of companies from the Romanian capital is a similar trend. In 2006, only 33 companies found 272 in 2010.
The data found that companies in neighbouring countries include low tax rates among the factors that have attracted Bulgaria.
For example, 24 per cent of the institutions are implemented in Greece, which is more than two of the rate on neighbouring countries.
Another effect that Greek companies have caused Bulgaria, the Greek government is austerity measures that the country has implemented as part of the most serious financial and economic crisis.
According to Theoos Alenidis, director of the Thessaloniki Greek Mode Industry Association, Greek companies are based on the beginning of the process "a new thing" to neighbouring Bulgaria, but not a "new thing".
Domase labour costs are a lot for employees. [Reuters]
"Everyone who can lose their work to Bulgaria has shown it, and no one did not expect the crisis," he said.
According to EU statistics, Greece is one of the highest countries in the fees, and Bulgaria is ranking the list of the list.
"Greek companies have strengthened their operations in the retail sector," he said, praising the cheaper business force in Bulgaria.
Bulgarian low transport costs, cheaper pollution and stable economy are among the factors that bring foreign companies to the country.
Following the fiscal reform of the Romanian government, which has been implemented to increase taxes and tightening arrangements, Romanian companies have begun to show more assets in Bulgaria.
The move of the Romanian government was made in accordance with international financial institutions' requests for 20-billion-euro loan, including austerity measures and assist the economic crisis.
institutions in Romania are 16 per cent.
Officials, however, restored this rate for some 3 per cent of the number of employees, while the number of employees lost from 100,000 euros.
According to Aurel Dragan, director of the Romanian economy magazine CAPITAL, the country is "more than the bureaucracy and financial obstacles, Romanian companies are in Bulgaria -- in the southeastern Romania -- to work in accordance with more active conditions."
The neighbouring country has caused austerity measures, business stopping and the loss of companies to Bulgaria. [Reuters]
Recent tax rates are also attracting the country in terms of individuals.
The most rich people in the city were a Romanian adviser who won 3.12m euros last year (about 1.6 million euros), the NRA centre in Russia said in a statement.
According to the NRA, the name was not announced, the tax debt debt was 187,000 euros (95,000 euros) as of May.
Apart from the companies in Bulgaria, external resources from Bulgaria for part of their operations are the current.
According to Jechko Dimitrov, head of the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Institute, the number of foreign resources is much higher than the number of companies.
Many say this is a positive thing for the country, because people in certain areas have provided jobs.
But the overall economic option in the country is not the same idea.
"The companies that use foreign funding are returning to all profit abroad.
This is not good for Bulgaria.
We need to find the investors and convince them to transfer their jobs to Bulgaria.
These companies come here because the business force is cheaper in our country.
These benefits. "
According to Dimitrov, who considers no tax mechanism does not work, this system has been done, "according to Dimitrov, as he believes," many major investors, general centres and financial experiences were transferred to Bulgaria. "
"It seems not the nominal value of taxes, but a total of business in Bulgaria.
If we do not have a transport infrastructure, you have problems with bureaucracy and corruption, it is more expensive to work.
The situation will it be the benefit of the tax to be low? "
"There is no policy to withdraw smaller cards in small villages in small villages, attract a region and development of the economy," he said.
New Turkish Pension Still

The new Turkish Penal Code (TCK), which will take effect on June 1st, will bring life changes to Turkey.
The law, which aims to eliminate the shortcomings of the EU, aims to eliminate any statehood in Turkish laws, is being removed by the Military Security Council, and the penalties for crimes are under civilian control.
However, critics say the channel is still restricted by using a conservative and broad terminology, using government officials or state officers, "thought" crimes ".
According to the Turkish Journalists' Association, the new TCK gives a number of borders on press freedom.
For example, a crime can increase in prison sentences in the case of media intelligence. According to the Association, the "insult" could be a third of the "controversial, and it is definitely defined with controversial and controversial decisions that could lead to controversial decisions.
Furthermore, if a journalist has been charged with insulting a minister, this judge has been registered in the entire cabinet, so it is the right to have a complaint from the newspaper.
The new TCK also envisions a prison sentence of six months to five years in prison for crimes against the public order and other crimes against the public order.
According to the Association, there is a substantial restriction of press freedom.
The law had to take effect on 1 April.
According to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, the government has postponed to implement changes in accordance with the demands made by journalist groups and civil society organisations. According to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the law has been changed by 26 June, and most of the amendments to the media.
Chairman of the Press Council, Oktay Eqi, who said the situation is not in many cases, adding that the organisation will advance the European Court of Human Rights if parliament moves.

Following a two-day visit to Bucharest, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday (March 1st) that Romania has a chance to make the necessary progress towards membership in the Union in January 2007.
He also warned, however, that there is no time to meet the criteria for membership.
"Romania must make any effort to meet the criteria for membership, and every week, every month, the fight against corruption and judicial reform should be the best evaluation," Rehn told reporters.
The fulfilment of the conditions set in the accession treaty is "the priority of all priorities", he added.
Romania, which wrapped up its membership talks in December, is scheduled to sign its accession treaty with Bulgaria on 25 April.
Although membership is expected to take place in 2007, a postponement could be postponed if it is not met the requirements set by the agreement.
In addition to the fight against corruption and political reforms, the country must also foster state subsidies that are providing in the central sector.
During his first official visit to Romania since the post in November, Rehn met with President Traian Basescu, Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, Foreign Minister Razvan Mihagureanu and other key officials.
Tariceanu assured Rehn that his country is determined to fulfil its commitments, particularly fighting corruption.
He said the administration has moved to rescue the Supreme Court of Judges to rescue political intervention, and that the former ministries removed judicial immunity.
"Authorities have no doubt of the fight against corruption," Tariceanu said.
A EC monitoring mission visits Bucharest this month and is scheduled to present a assessment in May.
Several months later, the EC will likely release its progress report on Romania in November.
Rehn pledged "fair assessment".
Montenegrin Independent Independent Community Progress
The Montenegrin leaders, who argued that the current state union is functioning and efficient, have offered Serbia-Montenegro to turn Serbia-Montenegro into an independent state union.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 02 / 03 / 05
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said the current Serbia-Montenegro union is not efficient until independent states will be. [AFP]
Montenegrin officials proposed on February 23rd to turn the state union of Serbia-Montenegro into an independent state.
The proposal was co-ordinated by Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and President Filip Vujanovic, who signed the proposal, said they are awaiting to reach an agreement with Belgrade on an alternative to the current state union, which they say is functioning and inefficient.
According to Montenegrin officials, the two independent and international recognition countries will achieve better results.
Without Serbia-Montenegro is expensive, leaders say the lack of the union is jeopardising diplomacy and the functioning of the army.
Dyukanovic and Vujanovic said the status quo would only increase insufficient insufficient unemployment and slowly slow the participation of Montenegro and Serbia in EU and international security structures.
The first reactions from Belgrade were not positive.
Kostunica described the plan as a clear violation of the Belgrade Treaty, which was signed with the EU, promising that a 2003 agreement would stop.
"The Constitutional Charter violates and violated its clauses, and Montenegrin authorities are trying to create an extraordinary situation that would lead to a distribution," Kostunica said in an interview published on Monday (February 28th) by Policy.
Kostunica said he is trying to avoid the independence referendum, since Dyukanovic 'latest proposal could be able to flee him in the case.
Kostunica 'deputy, Miroljub Labus, also opposed the initiative, despite the same idea on the state union of Montenegro, as one of the powerful advocates of independent Serbia.
"We have to hold a two-referendum, and this issue should not end the spring of 2006," Labus said.
"The priority of Serbia is to join the EU and achieve better living standards, but not to defend a joint country if it is," Tadic said.
Vujanovic, meanwhile, argues that Belgrade is not clear of its negative response, does not think Serbia is against its own sovereignty and independent international status.
The international community has stopped from Serbia-Montenegro to their affairs.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, however, voiced concern about political initiatives that would lead Serbia and Montenegro to unite Europe and cause political tensions.
According to the Beta news agency, authorities in Brussels have called the proposal "surprised surprise, as early as and inappropriate".
Following the killings of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, Serbia-Montenegro was lost two years in Euro-Atlantic integration, while this year should not be spent with consequences, officials said.
US Ambassador to Belgrade Michael C. Polt said Washington would support any democratic agreement between Serbia and Montenegro on its state status.
The Podgorica proposal has led to our way as a result of the constitutional crisis, which has led to direct elections for the Serbia-Montenegro Parliament.
The republic argues the protection of the state union, as well as independence, and the debate seems to be seen as the approach of 2006.
This year, Montenegro will have the legal right to organise a independence referendum under the Belgrade Agreement.

Authorities hope he would help anyone who ordered the assassination, as well as other optimistic questions about the case.
Milenkovic is said to have been in charge of the truck that Djindjic was in the Belgrade highway on February 21st 2003.
Other members of the Zemun station will organise a rocket attack, but the plan was dropped because Milenkovic did not stop Djindjic.
Milenkovic was arrested, but three days later.
The circulation requirements still fear uncertainty.
The Serbian police and the court have convicted each other, but no official investigation on the issue has not been launched.
Milekovic was disappeared after free. After 16 July 2004, he died in Thessaloniki on 16 months, when he was arrested in Thessaloniki.
In the first round of the Belgrade Special Organised Crime Court, Milenkovic asked the defence to take more time.
The trial was decided on March 9th.
"I know that many of them do not want to see me here," he said.
According to Serbian law, witness status could be given to Milenkovic, and charges against him could be reduced.
In this case, however, the prosecution has to tackle the prosecution and testify against the Zemun.
If this does not happen, Milenkovic will be tried on the assassination of Djindjic.
In addition, six murders and several witnesses have been involved in the incident.

BiH politicians urge police reform to end stalemate
If political leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina failed to reach an agreement until Sunday, the next step could be postponed for the country &aposs path to EU membership.

"Bosnian politicians are playing with the future of their country," EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said. [Getty Images]
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak urged Bosnian Serb politicians on Wednesday (September 26th) to block a compromise on police reform, a key condition for progress towards EU membership.
"It was much time and we will lose more time if a consensus was reached by Sunday," Lajcak said, referring to lawmakers in Republika Srpska (RS) parliament. "You wish and will not return at least a year."
Benzer also came from EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.
"Bosnian politicians are playing with the future of their own country," Solana said in an interview with the daily Dnevni avaz.
In December, BiH completed technical talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, considered a key step towards eventual membership in the Union.
Brussels, however, has made it clear that the agreement will not be signed this year if BiH politicians do not reach a compromise on the country &aposs police structures in line with EU standards.
Currently, the two sides -- RS and the Federation of BiH -- have their own police services.
Brussels wants all legal and budget competencies on the police to be found at the state level.
The EU also called for the creation of new police zones based on professional criteria, and to end police work in political intervention.
The efforts to reach the agreement have been stalled for more than two years.
Bosniak Serb politicians see the EU demands as a step forward to RS 'secession and rejected suggestions that the country has submitted to reunification and restructuring the two services.
On Wednesday, Lajcak assured Bosnian Serb lawmakers that the establishment of a single and more efficient police force does not have any threat to their entities.
If politicians support police reform, he said, BiH rejects the European path.
As a result, the country will face a "broadcasting" in the region and will remain in the EU integration process.
"We will be a test of the economic force that has chosen the solutions of the electoral isolation -- and we will limit our own prospects or have a positive impact on the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina," he said.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, however, said the entity will not accept the elimination of the army.
"I am not ready to accept nothing outside the structure of a Bosnian Serb police force on the territory of Republika Srpska," Dodik said.
At the same day, Bosnian Serb officials have warned that Lajcak would be able to withdraw from state level institutions if they are accused of using high powers, Dodik and others charging police reform.
Meanwhile, representatives of the eight main political parties in BiH have not reached an agreement, despite the fourth round of technical talks on police reform in Banja Luka.
The parties reportedly will continue talks on Friday.

ICJ judges have asked UN member states to present their views on Kosovo 'independence. [ICJ]
According to a report published on Tuesday (October 21st), the International Court of Justice (ICJ), UN member states recognise their views on Kosovo 'unilateral declaration of independence.
The General Assembly passed a proposal on 8 October that wants Serbia to advise the UN &aposs top legal board on whether it is in line with international law.
A week after the proposed proposal, the ICJ, known as the World War, decided on Friday that the UN and member states could "provide information" on the issue, and asked them to submit their writers until April 17th.
Divan also said on July 17th that he was "the final history" to present the state and institutions' words about other words.
Kosovo officials argue their declaration of independence, "will be able to contribute to the software."
The ICJ announced on Tuesday that they would invite themselves to trial.
Kosovo has created a legal team of international law expert Michael Wood to represent their interests in the ICJ.
"The Wood is one of the most successful and successful attorneys that we are prepared to defend us," President Fatmir Sejdiu 'office said last week.
"We are very confidence in the entire and experience."
However, it has not yet won a climate about how it is planning to address the issue after July.
In a press release Tuesday, "the decision that will be monitored later will be taken into a history".
The ICJ, founded in 1945, has two basic functions and two basic functions: to resolve disagreements between the state and the UN bodies and recommendations for legal questions that have been implemented by expert institutions.
In the second case, the recommendations on issues such as the declaration of independence of Kosovo are a constructive.
Therefore, the ICJ does not have to change these decisions of the 51 countries, which have been recognised by Europe, even if Kosovo &aposs unilateral commitment to international law in February, has not decided to change its unilateral international law.
Apart from Serbia, which is determined to oppose the discrimination of the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only former Yugoslavia that does not recognise Kosovo as an independent state.

"We cannot accept any person or the group to oppose Turkey," Iraqi Interior Minister Cevelad Bekei said in a statement at the Ankara airport. [Getty Images]
Iraqi Interior Minister Cevelad Bekei arrived in Ankara on Wednesday (September 26th) to discuss terrorist attacks by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey.
He and his Turkish counterpart, Besir Atalay, decided to sign an agreement aimed at eliminating the threat.
The agreement, which will be signed on Thursday after Turkish, Armenia and Britain, will allow Turkey to organise "scale team" operations in northern Iraq, including some conditions.
For the smaller military operations, the Iraq central government will have to be allowed.
Under the agreement, the two countries will create new security mechanisms, including "clean points" between Turkish and Iraqi security units.
The increasing PKK attacks on the mountainous northern Iraq have caused tensions between Turkey and Iraq.

"Turkey has been warning to its own since 1984," Basbug told students in Istanbul. "Turkey has affected concerns in Iraq with the United States.
The United States has to mean that the time is not true, and should show it. "
US State Department spokesman Tom Casey said Washington is aware of the importance of the problem.
"This is important for us.
A PKK foreign terror organisation has been defined.
We are working with the Turkish government and the Iraqi administration to ensure that they do not operate outside northern Iraq or in any other place, "he said.

The open proceedings on the law on the legality of the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo will begin on December 1st, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said on Wednesday (July 29th).
Those who want to participate in the proceedings must have to court until September 15th.
After that, the UN and member states, as well as their "preparations" of the independence declaration of Kosovo ", the tribunal will present the prosecutors and comments on the issue at the general headquarters in The Hague.
The General Assembly approved a decision on October 8th 2008 that Serbia wants the ICJ to declare an advisory decision on whether Kosovo is in line with the international law.
Kosovo authorities have been given until 17 April to submit their writers to the UN and member states on the case.
The Czech Republic was the first to do so, according to the ICJ statement Wednesday.
Earlier, 35 other UN member states had the same.
Albania and Romania are the Balkan countries that submit their prosecutors outside Kosovo and Serbia.
In April, media reports reported that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon presented a 2,000 page of documents and other material materials from March 1998 to March 1998.
The ICJ has given the UN, member states and Kosovo until July 17th to present comments on their prosecutors.
Kosovo and 36 countries presented comments.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on February 17th 2008 and has been recognised by 60 countries, including 22 EU member states, Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only former Yugoslav republics who do not do so.
Belgrade argues that Kosovo is part of Serbia.
Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic told BBC Radio B92 that "extremely flexible", promising that Pristina authorities would be able to see.
Jeremic said a possible amendment in the Belgrade stance has also been made.
"We do not want to recognise Kosovo if some of them are extradited to Serbia," Jeremic said. "We do not want to recognise any option.
We need to see whether they are in the case, "he said.
As for other advisory views by the ICJ, the court will not have a binding effect on Kosovo.
Therefore, none of the countries that have recognised the young country so far, the UN judges will not have to return to their decisions, even if they decide whether the country is in line with the international law.

A new survey found that Serbian youth is increasingly growing, athletes, scientists, scientists and historical intellectuals, and they want to get an example.
This prefect shows that young people are mostly folk songs and those who have recognised their role in the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s.
In a public survey conducted by the Serbian Open Society Fund in late 2010, tennis player Novak Djokovic, Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic, football player Nemanja Vidic and scientists were ranked highest in the list of Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein.
The change reflects the rise of young people in the fourth broadcast communication and computer skills, Sapologist Ratko Bozovic says.
"Most young people in Serbia have been discovered," Bozovic told SETimes. "Therefore, the consequences of the survey represents a normal reaction of the youth in the arbitration of the identity."
The survey participated in 1500 people from 15 to 29.
Only 10% of the lowest 10% chosen, Ceca Raznjatovic and Seka Aleksic, as well as Bosnian Serb leaders and war crimes indictees Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic.
He said the Serbian youth "refused to search a river and refused to seek supervised resources".
Science and Technology Ministry official Nada Mijatovic told SETimes the survey results are very encouraging.
"We are trying to support the right values in Serbia, and these results are crucial," Mijatovic said.
Among the defence efforts of the ministry, defence efforts are being organised by a major billboard of scientist Nikola Tesla, as well as projects aimed at promoting scientific and research.
The swimming of Tesla is the first to see passengers from Belgrade.
Some see the new generation of information as the reality of the country ’ s future development.
"There is an army that is no discontent in the fields of circumstances and skills of young people, they cannot be optimistic, if they are not successful, they do not want to invest and invest him," the Belgrade Institute for Public Authority said in an interview with local media.

Deputy Prime Minister Hajredin Thaci wants Kosovo Serbs to vote in the November elections.
According to Thaci, Kosovo Serbs should support decentralisation, but they should vote.
"Serbs must participate in the elections, because we do not interest in municipalities under the control of parallel structures, and we want Kosovo 'decentralisation," he said on Monday (July 27th).
He is optimistic that the minority group will participate.
Belgrade, however, is under pressure for the boycott of the elections, which will be used by former envoy Martti Ahtisaari to be used by Serbia.
"Serbs are still protected, and they do not have sufficient local government, which we do not have enough efforts in the process of decentralisation," Serbian Minister for Kosovo Goran Bogdanovic told Belgrade-based B92.
Bogdanovic said the decentralisation is a key step, and said Belgrade would support an organisation to be organised by an unilateral status, instead of "EU Special Envoy for Kosovo [Pieter Feith]]", instead of the Kosovo government.
According to B92, the Serbian minister described the Council as "unilateral status", the EU, the UN and UNMIK "and said Serbia will not be ready to launch talks that would help start the decentralisation of Kosovo, but said Serbia would not jeopardise its position.
"Despite many times, we are preparing to meet with EULEX," Bogdanovic said.
"There is a lot of problems that we have to solve.
We want to solve the rule of law in the north of Kosovo before we want to resolve the Serb community, but it is not to work on the laws of the Kosovo state, but not to work and support the Ahtisaari plan, "he said.

"It is clear that Montenegro will not contribute to the Alliance with the United States, Germany or France, but the capacity will also contribute to enough contributions," Vucinic told Southeast European Times.
The NATO security system will be the best option for Montenegro, he added.
"For us, there is no more urgent obligation for peace and stability in the Balkans that will create a positive impact on the economic development of the new NATO member states in line with the experience of their experiences," Vucinic said.
However, the opposition is not satisfied with the plan.
"It is defined in the existing laws that participate in the missions, but the key social problems have a challenge and the job should not be forced.
Therefore, certain soldiers will be really realistic to expect [they] decide to join a military post, "he said.
Bulatovic added that the government has more accomplishing the decision.
"Afghanistan is a very risk region and the possibility of the citizens of Montenegro and Montenegro to be targeted by international terrorism organisations," he said.
The preliminary training of 85 soldiers began in Danilovgrad, near Podgorica last August.
US Military Professor Migral Officials, the company Inc., began a three-month training of soldiers there.

Nearly two years later, Mostar was the centre of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Zahumlje and the "Open".
The president was transferred to Treje at the beginning of the 1992-1995 conflict.
Zahumlje and "Pishop Grigorije announced earlier this month.
According to Grigorije, the head of the Yetki Authority was a "historic moment for the Serbian Orthodox Church".
He urged all Serbs to return to the village and rebuild their homes.
Earlier this year ago, the Neretva River reserves both Serbs and Bosniaks. In 1991, there were about 240,000 Serbs living here.
Today, this figure is around 5,000.
"There are more than 100 housing applications, and only ten women can take the necessary resources for a year.
We have a simple problem on the same and pre-priority forecasts.
There are many people who are not satisfied with the situation, but even those returned are forced to find a continuous job, "he said.
Nevertheless, Serbs see the growing presence of the Orthodox Church as a encouraging signal.
"When I arrived in Mostar in 1999, I have been very useful in this city, where the churches were shot and the books of churches," said Grigorije, the head of the Zahumlje and "Open" in 1999.
Mostar Mayor Ljubo Beslic said the restoration of the bishop is important for the church, not only for the church, but also for the lives of Serbian, Croats and Bosniaks in many cities.
However, before the president returned, major preparations are needed.
"These preparations have begun the restructuring of the Zitz Economic Monastery and the reconstruction of the Orthodox churches' Neretva Valley.
This return means the creation of a process that has been discovered before everything, "he said.
In addition, the Charter Contemporary Church began reconstruction in March 2010.
The church was destroyed in the conflict.
The crowd is financed by the official and the Serbian Orthodox Church.
The Kutral Protection Church was first built in 1862 and 1873 years.
The money is granted by Serbs in Mostar and neighbouring areas.
Since the 19th century, the Orthodox artefacts in Bosnia and Herzegovina are discovering the search of the Orthodox metropolitaries, and the bishop is a leader in major centres or cities.

Jakup Krasniqi, head of the provisional state of Kosovo, said his country is ready to work together with EULEX in an investigation into allegations that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) stock bodies were taken at the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) camp.
The allegations in a report drafted by the Council of Europe (CoE) rapporteur Dick Marty were the issue of a resolution adopted by the Council of Europe (PACE) on Tuesday (January 25th).
"We are interested in achieving this matter, especially in the KLA, to be removed from the agenda of this immunity, especially the KLA," Krasniqi said.

On Tuesday, 89 and 14 optimistic votes against 169, PACE Marty approved the findings.
In a clinic on Albanian territory, the organisation said, some monuments have been taken to avoid abroad and that Serbian and Albanian intellectuals are "a variety of events" when they were inhumanitarian and non-humanitarian treatment at the end of secret prisoners.
The decision called for EULEX to be given a clear task, resources and high-level political support to fulfil the charges "extraordinary and important role" in the investigation.
"In accordance with the interest of persons and the interests of the countries, these allegations should be investigated and true," Slovenian Darja Lavti-Bebler said.
Lavti-Bebler cautioned the issue against politics and said it should not be allowed to allow dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.
"We have to be victims in Kosovo and the Western Balkans.
We cannot expect a compromise without the Justice, "he said.
Some PACE lawmakers oppose a draft decision or expressed concern about it.
"This is a prosecution claims," Turkey 'Oztoman said.
"The application of the decision consists of personal accusations, such as the final judge," he said.
Meanwhile, French Jean-Claude Frcon warned that "if these results are unacceptable and then that it would weaken the reputation of the Parliament".
Albanian representative Ilir Russia has called for the need.
"Without those who are, there should not be no use for the presence of the actual and unfair consequences.
Belgium groups or political forces should not lead to the overall condemn of countries, even in the way, "he said.
Thaci and other Kosovo leaders rejected allegations in the report by Marty, calling them as "bankruptcy" and "multiethnic".
On Tuesday, hundreds of Albanians organised a protest in front of the PACE building in Strasbourg.

Therefore, the Croatian tourism minister recommends the use of vehicles.

Since July 1st, heavy fuel prices have been the biggest problem of the Slovenian highway, which used Slovenian highways.
Ljubljana has implemented a new fee system that is not based on the couple used.
Instead, all sides of Slovenia have two opponents -- for a six-month use, or 55 euros for a year use of use, or a year of use.
Slovenians, which use the entire highway highway, have been cheaper from the system based on the previous couple, while foreign workers are discovered.
For example, Croatia will now have to pay at least 35 euros to use the Slovenian highway, which is planning a short holiday resorts.
Some say they will not be able to go to Croatia or feel the economy when they come to their assets.
Another missile point for them is that most Slovenian highways are in the structure of the Slovenian highway -- the roads are now trying to search for more than a fifth of 500km highway in the country.
A joint press conference recently organised by the Croatian tourist ministry and the Croatian Outobil Club (HEC) organised a joint press conference on the "Alpinion Freedom in Slovenia".
Both Tourism Minister Damir Bays and HEC President Ivo Bayic said alternative roads are lower in terms of concrete and security, but the amount of money has provided a significant amount of money.
Authorities said the existing wage system has declined to foreign unfair buildings, especially tourists.
Last year, 95 per cent of the 75 million tourists arrived in Croatia.
These were 32 million people from Slovenia.
Croatia, however, is not the only one that has complained.
The car clubs from Italy, Austria and Germany also want Slovenia to retain a week or a month cheaper methods, instead of protecting the Switzerland model.
Slovenian cards say the ministry of cards has not made enough revenues.
Austria has been trying to implement the same model several years ago, but the European Commission had to give up the request for ten days and two-month sites.
Current prices are 7.70 and 22.20 euros.
Although the EU has yet to pressure Slovenia on its path to make similar changes, European tourists will continue to pay 35 euros for a 22 square of Slovenian highway.
Izines are only an interim method of achieving highway revenues. Slovenia will be introduced within the next two years.

The UN war crimes tribunal -- former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, military commander Ratko Mladic and retired Croatian General Ante Gotovina -- warned that BiH, Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia will not wait closer to their relations with NATO.
The BiH authorities were encouraging on Wednesday that Karadzic and Mladic should be able to prevent justice in The Hague, he said.
"I hope that BiH political party leaders, as well as the tripartite presidency members, would be a step forward in this direction," the local media quoted him as saying in Washington over five weeks. "

Meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro ranked the first of 12 main reforms in the world, replacing Georgia, Vietnam, Slovakia, Germany, Egypt, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Pakhstan, Ruanda and the Netherlands.
"There are more progress in the documentary areas that Serbia-Montenegro has made more progress than Serbia-Montenegro, including Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine, but Serbia-Montenegro is the most progress in reforms, when it comes to all areas," World Bank spokesman Vesna Kostic said.
According to a 1888 page survey, Serbia-Montenegro has made progress in eight of the ten areas in the report.
The country sparked business rules, license, employment and labour, tax payment, closing and bankruptcy procedures.
The two areas -- protecting investments and foreign trade -- have not been made.
The capital, which must be needed to create 5,000 euros, has been reduced from 51 days to 15 days, as the company must be registered for losses.
While welcoming the progress made, the World Bank office in Belgrade Director Carolina Fingr welcomed the progress, warning.
The arrest is important, he said.
"There was many beautiful things and we have a lot of interest in the government," the AP quoted him as saying. "We have made an extraordinary progress, so we do so, and we have to do so so," the government quoted him as saying.
The World Bank countries, especially in particular, want to speed up judicial cases, spread of property rules and facilitate foreign trade.
Serbian Economy Minister Predrag Bubalo welcomed the report, but the reforms must wait to increase the quality of the Serb people, as a result of reforms.
"What has changed is that we have to work, and we will have to work very work, but we will feel that our citizens will be able to make these improvements and other deficits at the end of a long time," Bubalo said.
Foreign investors insist the pace of reforms and should not be slow.
"There are things that we have not been functioning, but we do not expect all in two years to be excellent.
We have a plan and I am pleased to see progress, "he said.

Nevertheless, he is confident that he could be able to deal with difficult challenges.
Natasa Sandroglu arrived in the world.
However, the efforts of his family lives without genocide.
The mother of Natasa was leaving the presence of the Children 'Team, six years ago, and the life of his daughter was completely changed.
The new friends have begun to take part in the days of death, and have begun to attend theatre, theatre, concerts.
Natasa attended a programme, "Hayat School", launched by the institution.
The programme is the goal of developing young people -- such as preparing and work for a day, and to ensure that their lives will be able to continue more independent.
"We are doing everything we live in our own, and we do not help us.
We seek our responsibilities to our own, "he said.
As one of the most successful participants of the programme, Natasa was given an opportunity to work at the Children 'Kalbin.
And everyone come to the only day to transport and work.
Since the start of the work, there have been many tasks to develop the project.
Even then, they say, "tough" has started.
"We have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly," he said, adding that all mission and employees should be provided to the explosion that they will be able to be located, such as cafe and water.
We showed that there is a rating and "no" nor no "of the daily jobs at the same time," he said.
"What is the biggest fears of the parents of a personal obstacle," said Tanja Staljonic, a representative of the Children Team. "How do you want to tell these young people in the Hayat School?"
"Mutch should always be cleaned and this is my job," Natasa said.
Apart from the business, he is repeated.
Women and the society are at the time to monitor TV and play video players.
"Annem does not allow many TV to be monitored or not for a long time in front of the computer," he said.
There is a competence and some of the work we want to read us, and I am written in my writes.
Tanja Staljonic, a representative of the Children Team, briefed us more detailed information on the programme.
The programme said the target of the programme is to enhance a more independent animal life when it comes to intellectual obstacles.
"What is the biggest fears of the parents of a personal obstacle," Staljonic said. "How do you want to tell the young people in the Hayat School, at the Hayat School, we are trying to tell them in a few days.
Everything can know their responsibilities and daily duties.
"We are beyond the things, but we are only in the crisis and we have intervened," he said.
About 50,000 children have participated in Children Team projects in the past eight years.
"It is a difficult co-operation with them.
Many are not true about how they will benefit their rights.
The cafes are mixed and they know they will go.
In this context, the Children [Team] serves as an intelligence centre that they can receive all necessary information. "
Natasa has taken many tasks to develop the project, which is send the factors in business.
Increased employment opportunities for investments are a simple issue in Serbia for a few years.
However, it is easy to find a job of physical obstacles such as Staljonic.
"The employees do not demonstrate the night of the matter, and they cannot want to take responsibility for a personal obstacle.
The situation is completely different for those who do not have a problem in intellectual functions.
The only need for them is the removal of some obstacles and will work, and these are not worried when it comes to the job, "he said.
Staljonic argues that the accession process in the normal education system should be in line with the options of persons.
"Children, or for example, have to be able to travel to normal schools and travel.
The intellectual obstacles cannot overcome such programmes, but also the need for practical skills, "he said.
"Nevertheless, these children are not in the same classes, but at least in the same school buildings, there is no mutual tolerance and an idea for differences," Staljonic said.
About 250,000 intellectual obstacles in Serbia are estimated, but it is not clear.
Furthermore, families in rural areas are hiding such people.
Those who are not included in education and social protection systems can be found even a dozen dozen medical witnesses.

Husin Hussein Husseinovic is still at the bottom of the new, but the bottom of the bottom in Srebrenica.
However, Huseyinovic says, the airports will be ready to compete here here.
This is an example of the UNDP in the type of small businesses that helped develop here.
The UNDP Srebrenica Regional Development Programme gives help those who want to return to one of the most rest areas in the country.
The July 1995 Srebrenica massacre, which has seen since World War II, has been held.
The majority of local authorities in the region and the eastern Republika Srpska have been under financial support by 1999, due to political obstacles.
"If the UNDP does not take place in this project, it is clear," said Huseyinovic, who returned to his house a year ago. "The UNDP was one of the fifth, but we will not start finding it."
He is one of 166 people, which opened in 2002 and is part of a three-year project worth 10.4m euros.
According to Manx Prieto, about 2,000 people have been beneficial so far.
The restructuring of factories operating before the war is now on the establishment of small enterprises that can work in the rural and distribution region.

The return of the past 12 months has been almost equal to the number of returns in six years.
Following the incidents in 1995, many observers think the people will return to the region.
In addition, no one does not believe the project could be able to reinforce the opportunities here.
UNDP officials say efforts are a symbol of the region following the traffic.
"This is the biggest, fundamental and main reason for the UNDP to continue the project," said UNDP Deputy Secretary of State Moises Venancio. "We have to share people who live in this project, and to help those who live here," said UNDP Deputy High Representative Moises Venancio.
Among the plans for 2004, the creation of a small loan line with women 'enterprises, promoting agricultural loans and smaller animal monuments, completion of 17 civil society projects and improving infrastructure.
He says the programme is effectively affected by the money laundering in the short term.
"People are trying to receive unemployment assistance, and they are awaiting to help," he said. "However, I am not a job."
The UNDP has not made a loan to one of its loans and has a greater investment that allows the family to work on the basis. "
Del Ponte War Crimes War Crimes War Crimes Still Charter
UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte sworn that the war crimes tribunal in The Hague will not close the doors before Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic and Croatian Ante Gotovina.
(Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, HINA - 12 / 09 / 03)
Chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, who began the office of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), said his priorities are the list of the remaining fugitives.
The tribunal will not close its doors before Bosnian Serb wartime leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, and Croatian General Ante Gotovina, del Ponte said, urging them to surrender by the end of 2003.
The three are the list of 17 counts of war crimes suspects who are in the losses.
"The Croatian government must surrender Ante Gotovina to The Hague," del Ponte said at a press conference Friday (September 12th).
Bosnian Serbs have focused on all co-operation with Karadzic, "he said.
As part of a strategy approved by the UN Security Council, all investigations of the ICTY must be completed by the end of 2004 by the end of 2004, all cases of clearly cleansing are to complete by the end of 2008.
All activities with this programme will be completed by 2010.
However, del Ponte cautioned that the completion strategy could be jeopardised if efforts to capture indictees at the search list are successful.
Mladic and Karadzic are charged with genocide because of their alleged involvement in major atrocities committed during the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the Srebrenica massacre.
Del Ponte, who has repeatedly said Mladic is in Serbia, called for authorities to arrest him.
Karadzic is widely believed to be hiding in Republika Srpska, the entity, the Serb administration in BiH.
Gotovina, who has been in losses since 2001, has been charged with atrocities against Serb civilians during a 1995 attack on the Croatian Army.
Del Ponte claims that Croatian authorities know that the general is in the case.
"Both my office and the Croatian government know that General Ante Gotovina is in the reason," del Ponte said.
The tribunal will continue to ask the international community to assist the most wanted figures to justice, he said, adding that these persons have no success in capture and trial.
"I will not take into account the possibility of this possibility.
Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina will be arrested by the end of the year and will be transferred to the tribunal.
The court will not close the doors until Karadzic, Mladic and Gotovina are in front of the judiciary, "he said.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan said on Friday that his government was "no talks with General Gotovina".
"Croatian service usually know that he is in Croatia and what is," he said, adding that the fugitive will be arrested so far.
Racan urged him to surrender to the tribunal, saying he would be good for both the country and to surrender.
In a statement, Croatian President Stipe Mesic called on The Hague to surrender Gotovina to defend its own and Croatia.
Defence Reform in BiH Discuss New Safe
As part of the defence reform process under the auspices of the international community, the Defence Reform Commission presented the state defence bill.
The bill will make Bosnia and Herzegovina a safe candidate for the NATO Partnership for Peace programme.
By Antonio Prlenda for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 20 / 10 / 03
The reform process in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) defence structures has entered a new phase at the end of September, when the Defence Reform Commission (SRK) submitted a state defence bill to parliament.
High Representative Paddy Ashdown, the head of the US military expert James Locher II, wrapped up a 100-day mandate for concrete legal and treatment, which was taken to restore BiH defence structures during 2004.
The system is a precondition for full membership in the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme.
Under the SRK recommendations, the two sides, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS), will continue to have separate entities and defence ministries from each other.
The parties, however, will be united by a staff, operational commander and the state level of defence.
The high commander of the BiH armed forces will be part of a joint BiH presidency, which will receive decisions through reconciliation.
The defence ministries will have a administrative commander on army and logistical purposes, while the voluntary commander will be formed through a joint staff and operational commander.
The military will be completely a state level of defence minister for co-ordination of the budget.
The head of the headquarters, the head of the joint staff and the state defence minister, will be appointed by Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats, three ethnic groups that have taken the country.
The system was designed to prevent the armed forces against any of the three ethnic groups.
"These decisions on defence reform are crucial," Ashdown said. "It is no longer clear that the road to NATO through the PfP.
However, the decisions still need to be approved by the BiH state assembly. "
The RS Army has 6,000 soldiers in active service, while the FBiH Army has 9,200 Bosniaks and 4,000 Croats.
Under the SRK recommendations, the number of soldiers will be reduced to 12,000 in a bid to ensure that the armed forces can stay in fiscal space and save 1 per cent of GDP.
Both sides will serve in the same uniforms, which includes the BiH state flag and radio.
In addition to seven local representatives from the two sides' defence ministries and the BiH Military Committee, the SFOR, NATO, the Office of the High Representative and the OSCE mission in BiH.
Representatives of the EU, the United States, Russia and Turkey were also part of the commission.

The Serbian and Kosovo negotiators have spent more than two months after they meet to discuss technical issues.
However, many important problems have not been discussed, such as missing persons.

The son of Mitrovitan Bajram Club, who was in 1999, was still at 19, and had not been made any news for 13 years.
Serbia is repeatedly thought to be closed with the EU without issues such as war compensation and losses and missing persons, according to a continued ongoing UN-Serbia talks with the EU.
"Brussels is not serious.
In addition, the issue was suggested that any steps Serbia will be able to move closer to the EU as a preliminary precondition.
If we have seen so far, we have shown that Brussels has not been serving the issue so far. "In any case, some of them will have to be able to stay in the court and give them to justice," Zira said.
Recent comprehensive issues have not yet been among the basic matters of talks between Kosovo and Serbia.
The negotiating process, which began in March 2011, is slowly on technical issues.
At the same time, some important developments such as a compromise on the common border management are not in place, but energy, telecommunications and technical issues such as regional representation of Kosovo have not been reduced.
He also feels the uncertainty that will begin talks.
The latest session between the weeks was held on December 2nd.
"The next session will not give a clear information on the history of the next session, but both sides say that the dialogue process continues and that they are participating in this process," EU spokesman Maja Kociancic told SETimes.
In one side, two movements from the Kosovo opposition parties have become more complicated. On February 7th, the main opposition party in the Kosovo Democratic Union of Kosovo (LDK) called for official intervention.
LDK Mayor Isa Mustafa, also Pristina Mayor, told Kosovo state television RTK that Kosovo should guarantee that Kosovo is not against Serbia, but "Kosovo state television should be guaranteed to the international community," Kosovo state television President Isa Mustafa, who also told the Kosovo state television. "In the other hand, the country has taken a part of its territory of Kosovo

Other opposition party, Vetevendosje, has so far asked the Constitutional Court to monitor the deals with international agreements and decide whether it is needed for parliament approval.
The opposition party also organised two separate protests last month, as the government formed the measures for a mutual border with Serbia.
Kosovo Chairman Edita Tahiri said the talks should be discussed this year, adding that all sides -- Kosovo, Serbia and the EU -- have been taken into consideration of the pre-priority issues.
"Serbia must fulfil its obligations from the Kosovo war," Tahiri told SETimes.
The issue of Belgrade is completely different.
"There is no compensation for one of the same country.
First, I know that, "he adds.
Marko Milanovic, an international law professor at the Nottingham University in Britain, agrees that Kosovo is very difficult to obtain war compensation from Serbia because it is not an independent state during the war.
"Serbia violated the rights of its own citizens, not another state, but in that time," he said.
According to Kosovo lawyer Adil Fetahu, Serbia has not been allocated for millions of euros in Kosovo, and Pristina must not be able to remove this compensation.
"There are many things that need to be done here and many years, even more than ten years," Fetahu said. "Kosovo and Serbia should be possible to reach an agreement on war compensation, which is not possible," he said.
"There is no possibility of a solution in the near future," Fetahu said, stressing that the Serbian border is a very complex political problem.
At this point, however, the EU cannot be a member of any state that has not been able to resolve border dispute with its neighbours, and each country does not remind the conditions "that the EU survey should remind the questions on border neighbours".
"This agreement will be an extraordinary situation in implementing this agreement, and the agreement will be better than the negotiators are in practice," said Dusan Jagic, a researcher at the Belgrade Institute for Social Information.

The technical dialogue will be "doubt" in the process of dialogue, because the technical dialogue is "in the bridge for Belgrade, he said, adding that the international community and Kosovo authorities are trying to do everything they can to use" when it comes to Belgrade ".
Meanwhile, the public will be resolved if important issues are resolved.
"So far, the agreements have been adopted with challenges.
There are huge details.
I do not think that the removal of the border will be taken at the time, "he said.
Kosovo Serb Sasa Denic, who lives in the eastern Kosovo, said "How would you have to pay a part of Kosovo, or the people in Kosovo to pay payments?"
However, it seems to be both optimistic about the issue of the matter of everyone.
So far, 2370 losses have been identified and identified identities, according to the International Customs Commission.
"The number of people who have not been registered during the war in Kosovo is about 1,800," said commissioner Kathryne Bomberger, noting that "the number of people who are still unable to have been reduced for years."
"This is why we have focused on us," said Serbian negotiator Borko Stefanovic, a Serbian negotiator who left the couples, who did not reveal an effective mechanism that would provide people.
Gordana Djukanovic, a head of the Serbian Association of Affairs in Kosovo, said that people from Kosovo are registered in the list of 512 Serbs and Albanian villages, as well as the Albanian ethnic victims.
"Before the Belgrade -- Pristina talks have met with Borko Stefanovic, and the negotiator said that the issue will be invested under the agenda," Djukanovic told SETimes. "But the issue has not been put on the agenda.
"I am convinced that the authorities in Belgrade and Pristina have supported the testimony of the labour and renovated witnesses and decided to take a primary and sincerely step towards the destruction of the losses, and the families can learn the feelings of their jobs," he added.
Macedonia, Kosovo car against crime
Macedonia wants neighbouring Kosovo to co-operate in the fight against crime, and the Kosovo interior ministry began to take first steps.

In an exclusive interview with SETimes, Rexhepi speaks about the future co-operation with Macedonian authorities.
SETimes: What are the steps that have reached an agreement and how will it be done?
Bajram Rexhepi: We strengthen relations between the two countries, particularly security issues.
Macedonia and the police have signed a memorandum of understanding on police co-operation and we expect to implement it through technical protocos.
We decided to communicate between two interior ministries and albet agencies to show a common and efficient fight against organised crime, weapons trafficking, drug trafficking, human trafficking and illegal migration.
SETimes: In the visit, Macedonian authorities have reportedly been given a list of 70 Albanians, who are indicted in Kosovo and Macedonia.
Is the interior ministry information about those in this list?
Rexhepi: We received a list of people suspected of suspects suspected in Kosovo, respectively.
According to first control, the majority of those people are Macedonian citizens.
Liste communicated police and judicial institutions.
Special mechanisms in the country will take place in every case and will act in accordance with Kosovo laws.
SETimes: The accusations that Kosovo has played a role in tensions in Macedonia.
How do you comment on these allegations?
Rexhepi: In the past, in particular, Kosovo has been charged with exports of violence and weapons trafficking and tensions, prior to its recognition of independence.
We have changed that, and Kosovo is not only a consumption, but also as a permanent contribution to regional security.
Kosovo is also committed to security and regional stability, as well as the rule of law.
We emphasise that this donation is an efficient fight against all crimes in our countries.
We are a safe partner and we do not want to follow this approach.

Del Ponte Calls to EU, Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro in front of ICTY Co-operation

According to Chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte, pressure from the EU played a key role in achieving better co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal. [AFP]
The EU should not boost relations with these countries, UN war crimes tribunal chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte said on Thursday (September 1st), if Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro have not surrendered indictees wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
"full co-operation with the ICTY is one of the requirements for EU membership for the former Yugoslav countries," del Ponte said at a conference on the Balkans in Bern, Switzerland, Switzerland,. "The process of European support is not strong.
In addition, Croatia and Serbia-Montenegro are co-operating with the tribunal, with only international pressure. "
Welcoming the two countries' current co-operation with the ICTY '' level of co-operation with the ICTY '' ', del Ponte called on Brussels to pressure them to fulfil international obligations and hand over war crimes indictees indicted by the tribunal.
"As a country has a candidate status, the EU has a challenge to implement reforms," del Ponte said. "It will be no power when it comes to the country."
Croatia, authorities have arrested retired General Ante Gotovina by March and surrendered to the ICTY, and will begin EU accession talks.
However, Zagreb has been pushing for talks with the UN tribunal if it is not able to prove full co-operation with the UN tribunal.
Meanwhile, Serbia-Montenegro is scheduled to begin talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU on 5 October.
Both the EU and the United States have increased pressure on Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to extradite former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, believed to be hiding in Serb control areas or in Montenegro in recent months, to extradite wartime military commander Ratko Mladic.
"The international community and international justice will be a major blow to them to ensure immunity," del Ponte said in Bern.
In a speech at the European Parliament on Tuesday, Croatian Foreign Minister Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic rejected the allegations that Zagreb has done everything to find Gotovina.
"It is not a clear change in the operations of Croatia.
It points out that Gotovina is still in the region, "he said.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said on Thursday that Croatia is implementing a action plan for co-operation with The Hague, noting that Gotovina is one of the supporters of Gotovina, Hrvoje Petrac, who was suspected of support in Greece at the beginning of this week.
At the meeting, del Ponte described it as a positive development, intellectual example of international co-operation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies and an opportunity to avoid Gotovina to protect Gotovina.
"We will feel that Croatia has done its actions in the coming weeks," the prosecutor said.
"We expect Croatia to demonstrate an aggressive action position in the development of this new development to hand Gotovina to The Hague," he said.
Del Ponte was the same time with the beginning of a two-day official meeting of EU foreign ministers' foreign affairs, Gallery, on the beginning of a two-day official meeting.
The meeting also includes Croatia &aposs bid to join the Union.
Britain Foreign Minister Jack Straw said on Thursday that the EU would review Croatia ’ s bid for membership in mid-September and decide on whether to begin accession talks.
Before the verdict, Del Ponte will be asked to report on Croatia ’ s co-operation with the ICTY.

The most important season tourist tourism in terms of the Greek economy is a serious stalemate, due to competitiveness prices, heavy legal arrangements and bureaucracy.
The situation is the most Turkish job, while Croatia and Montenegro in the past few years have been removing the share of this architecture and motories that have fled Greece.
As Greece seems to be sceptically, we are hiding by the previous socialist government in 2009, when the previous socialist government has repeatedly repeatedly removed taxes for the ships, because the Greek coastal Security authorities were repeatedly "full special method" in 2011, according to data from the Greek coastal Security Council.
According to figures from Ilias Perimenis, head of the Greek Authority Association of Company, which operates in the monopoly industry, sales and service providers, "the figures from the Greek Authority 'Association, which removed the situation to tax criteria for the owners in 2002, but in 2002, the number of restructurers have been remov
"This truth criteria are full Greek.
At the same time, the state has lost money because of these practices, but in the state, it is losing money, because the production industry, which has employed thousands of people, "Perimenis, a group of the ruling interim government, which has been represented, and expects to remove better taxes, such as the residents and businesses.
With the situation in Greece, neighbouring Turkey has been seen as an extraordinary number of Greeks, its experience figures and many foreign monopolies.
The initiative is Stavros Gavrias, such as Perimenis, is from the ministries of optimistic ministries. Gavrias, who has been working in the Sea tourism area, says many Greeks working on Turkey.
"In one time, tax inspectors have been supervised to foreign flags, and this is very exaggerated in terms of monopoly owners and teacher.
Nine owners and enterprises are unwilling to see their monopoly.
And they can work from their own, many are going to Turkey, "he said.
Gavrias, the biggest obstacles to the growth of the sector, ranks extremist bureaucracy on the construction and business of competitiveness prices, and the poor prices for competitiveness. "
"The most attractive is to open more, better and better prices.
For this, the opening of willingness investors must be liberalised in the sector.
If you see, Turkey is a more competitive position with both the prices and the right services, "Gavrias said, stressing that the industry is very needed to make new architecture and business.
Apart from Turkey, Turkey, Montenegro has already begun as a operational base for magazines, the Adriatic industry said.
Antonis Stelliatos, head of the Greek flag Association of Professor Youth Youth, said that the number of registered professional monopolies in the country is between 3.150 and 3.500, and 800-8 teachers have been widespread, the rest of the rest.
"More than 5,000 islands and a half years of history and cultural flexibility, which is a minimum balance, is only 19 full equipment" in a country of safe, which is a safe history and cultural phenomenon.
According to data by Stellaiatos' association, 28 per cent of the liquidity monopolies in Greece, Turkey and Montenegro have fled to other countries in the region, including Croatia and Montenegro.
"These criteria we can be seen as a high level of primary level, but the consequences of the public debt have been accepted because of the consequences, the state revenues and unemployment has not been able to increase," Greek Tourism Association Secretary-General Giorgos Vernicos said.
We are looking from the Aegean Sea, but we are facing reports that the country has turned into the Adriatic, which is at least at least at least to Croatia, and the country has transformed into a new fuel centre in the accordance with the prices of prices.
Dubrovnik Mayor Andro Vlahusic was a letter to the country &aposs largest oil company, INA, who recently asked the company to modernise its fuel stations in the southern resorts, allowing the clients to make more attractive for their clients.
According to Juroslav Bujubasic, a former ancient in Seagull 2, the biggest problem for experience in Croatia is the price of fuel prices.
"They are mostly in Montenegro, Italy or Malta.
As prices in Croatia are very high, people are leaving other places for their goods.
We have been able to get two prices in Montenegro, but this summer I do not think that nobody will be able to foster the financial patience, if the prices are not attracted, the prices have not been pushed, "he said.
At the same time, the current official data shows that more than 400 megas-theatre rooms each year.

Turkish Government Reforms
A recent bill on reform in Turkey was presented by municipal authorities, secular institutions, workers unions and intellectuals.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 05 / 05 / 03
The Justice and development Party (AKP) has promised that a key part of the central bureaucracy powers will be transferred to local authorities, promising that the US agriculture administration would be signaled.
With the overall majority of the Turkish Parliament, the AKP is unable to take many challenges on these reforms.
However, the proposed law envisions fundamental institutions, intellectuals and labour unions.
Turkey took place in 1920.
Before the establishment of the republic, the debate over whether a US vehicle system would be preferred and not be transferred.
It was impossible in the bridge, because the direct elections have no chance to vote because of the lack of education and communication.
In addition, the only party system is facilitating its authority to central Ankara.
Three initiatives for a multiparty political regime have been followed by the army 'control of the government.
However, the political life in Turkey after the 1980s declared a coup.
As the census is growing, the government in Ankara has also grown.
The reform has been on the agenda of Turkey, but optimism staff is the transfer of some of the authority that gathered in Ankara, to reduce the number of options or reduce the number of personnel.
The centre has been criticised for years when the government has not been insufficient to resolve local problems, but the decentralisation losses and continued delays.
Tourgut Ozal 'presidency in 1989-1993 has also discussed delaying the presidency system. In the time of the 1989-1993, Tgut Ozal also asked the creation of seven region and the transfer of the central authority to them.
However, conservatives and the army dismissed the battle against the PKK in southeastern Turkey, where most of the Kurds seeking autonomy are living.
The removal of a type system has been fired.
A number of people feel that the elections see him as a vehicle to keep him in office.
The mandate is now limited with a seven years.
Special 'successor, the popular popular name of politics, Sulejman Rodl, has repeatedly removed the issue, but still rejected similar doubts.
During last decade, governments have failed to reform the central administration, as they have two or three parties with different political views.
In addition, the letters in governance payments have been distributed in traditional forms, traditional party supporters or relatives.
Nevertheless, reforms have been growing.
In the past, Turkey has joined the IMF, with the removal of bureaucracy reform and unnecessary pockets, as the criteria for a loan to Turkey.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on April 21st that he would welcome a American agriculture management, which is the transfer of unilateral and central powers.
Local administrative reform was one of the main platforms in the AKP &aposs election manipulation.
The draft law was presented in parliament last week.
Under the law, many ministries of ministries in the municipal administration of interior, foreign affairs, national education, health, finance and justice ministries will be transferred to local governments.
Municipalities' management will remain in the area of control, while the authority of the governments will be taken from the interior ministry and transferred to the judiciary.
The reform will also cause some changes in the central government, with the prime minister and the unification of state institutions based on certain ministries.
The AKP argues that reforms would lead to an increase in the public sector.
As the same details were revealed, the country has started to attack secular institutions, intellectuals and workers unions.
According to the ministries, the closure of the ministries will cause unemployment and expensive taxes.
At the same time, mayors also appealed to the expansion of the governments that will be appointed by the government.
The law also includes the establishment of a local Local Committee to appoint the head of the government.
According to mayors, these amendments will lose the way to gain reforms.
Despite the same months, the reforms have rejected some aspects of the reforms, which have been convinced that the public will increase the risk of cars.
The transference of the authority to local governments will not strengthen them, and will implement additional taxes.
They also warned that the AKP, which is born from the Islamic Fazilet Party, could try to change Turkey 'secular structure.
Despite protests from Erdogan and AKP officials, Turkey remains suspected in the situation.
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer accused the ruling party of trying to open Islamic ideology to the state administration.
Erdogan criticised Sezer for the way of government appointments to public agencies.
"Ottoman" rise in Turkey
Although the restructuring of the Ottoman culture and history is seen as a "trade" for identification ", Turkey could also be a referendum for internal and foreign policy.

The "Ottoman" interest in every city of Ottoman, which has shown a new trend in Turkey for a few years.
This is not the popularity of television stations such as "Muhevem", which is only under the circumstances of Sulden Sulejman and his abuse.
It also found that Ottoman historical history books reflect in the rise of exhibitions on the Ottoman river, museum, restoring the restoration of the Ottoman buildings and the Ottoman resort.
While this new model is not a certain commercial boycott, the Ottoman heritage, proactive regional diplomacy, the expansion of market markets and overall social divisions.
According to Doc Dr. Zeynep Ertug, who has spread for Ottoman cultural history at the University of Istanbul, there are two resources from Ottoman.
"First, the first of the society that lives with European culture, is to stay in a symbolic life, with the rising capacity of the individuals that have already been in a river, as a result of a huge house."
At the same time, experts do not see this trend as a member of the Kemist state ideology, which has been trying to overcome the Ottoman history, as well as the Ottoman past.
Even more, this new trend reflects a reflection of the changes in the approach to the Ottoman culture.
So far, people were not as a culture of a life of the Ottoman Empire, but not a simple state.
"Despite all the efforts to visit the capital, Ottoman is a cultural culture that includes a lot of life and fear," Emre Alkin, who tells SETimes.
This trend has caused a increase in the number of people who are more proud of Ottoman past.

"In fact, people have been reminded to know that the past has been bad, and now they are now going to learn everything that is not worse," he said.
At the same time, the Ottoman era is unprecedented as the monoly of the Ottoman era, and in some of these period, some of them were defeated.
Therefore, people who have been closed to such an architecture can only be proud of the Ottoman past, but "some" period ".
"However, one of the long-term term has been closed to us?" he says, "If you have been disappointed by the University of Galatasaray?"
Some experts, such as absence, have acknowledged that "an ongoing golden gasoline in the past decade, while others think it is a month development.
"Although the interest of the Ottoman Employment is not always false, the routes that discussed Ottoman as a policy of policy are now different, now seems to be more rich," Doc said, adding that the University of Washington and the Ottoman Studies programme is part of the Turkish and Ottoman Studies.
In addition to the institution, the interest of TV diessels, exchange of goods in shopping centres and the basis for instance, is a way to revive the market in Turkey and the revival of the Turkish market abroad.
"The revival of the Ottoman era in this period shows that this issue is a value in the market economy," he said.
According to Kuru, the unit of a certain academic actors in the past century has been sparked to the rise in this car.
At the same time, the Ottoman heritage could be a referendum point in exchange its foreign policy and to overcome ID problems.
The Ottoman Employment of the Ottoman Empire is a pop for different identity and religious ideas in the Balkans and the Middle East, said AKP MP Professor Pelin Gunden.
Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (centre), Bosniak member of the Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Bakir Izetbegovic (left) and Bosnian Bureau Governor Mustafa Ceric in Sarajevo.

"The Ottoman Employment has been tolerated for five years of tolerance, peace and political stability in the Middle East and the Balkans.
This is Ottoman model, the Middle East and the Balkans could be a referendum for Turkish policies, "he said.
"As the history shows us, Turkey has the potential to play a very important role in peace, stability and economic prosperity in the Balkans and in the Middle East over the next ten years," he added.
At the same time, the interest of the Ottoman heritage does not mean a permanent aspect of the permanent aspect, as it is a "New Ottoman".
Even more, the post-Cold War Crimes economic needs and geopolitical amendments are a lot of consequences.
According to him, what is the new Ottoman isolation is removed from the new geographic law in Turkey, in fact, it is not a new market. "This is not a cultural broadcasting, but not a cultural broadcasting, but also to expand economic life."
Political commentator Mustafa Mediterranean does not see it as a conservative initiative. "If there is no longer, it is a more reasonable vision in foreign policy," he said.
"If the Balkans and Middle East historical donations are unprecedented, there is always time to avoid extremist flexibility," he said.
While the residents are repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly from the West, the Mediterranean seems to see Turkey ’ s growing Ottoman heritage as a loan of Europe.
"The Ottoman Empire was an important part of the European policy in the factors such as France and Britain.
Therefore, everything is that Turkey 'EU accession process is now seen, but the Ottoman past is not except Europe, "he said.
It is the most important factor for internal stability, as the revival of the Ottoman heritage could result in a positive step towards the restructuring of differences in the Turkish community. "Another, the society has been increasingly exaggerated in the Kurdish and beautiful elements," he said.

In Zaman, "hundreds of intellectuals, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats are" the victims of their efforts to overcome the region allegedly claimed Serbs, "Plavsic said, adding that Serbs could prove" fearing the victims of their own neighbours, such as World War II.
"I have caused people to withdraw, and I think that I would have the right to the people," said Plavsic, the top Bosnian Serb in the tribunal.
Plavsic is the only woman indicted for war crimes committed during the conflict in the Balkans.
Biljana Plavsic also rejected eight charges against him.
But in a surprise decision in October, a surprise decision withdrew seven other charges, including the Prosecutors' Prosecutor 'Prosecutor, who agreed to indict crimes against humanity.
Plavsic, a biographic professor at 72, was a close ally of Radovan Karadzic and the wartime assistance.
However, the relations with this person was a time.
After the end of the war, Plavsic was transferred to the Republika Srpska Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instead of Karadzic, and played a key role in implementing the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1998.
The incidents during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina are "unprecedented", former US Secretary of State Matleine Colonel said on Tuesday, adding that the incidents were a responsibility for the incidents as a "complicated persecution".

Judge judges have decided that Plavsic will decide on the sentence, while the decision is expected to replace the victims of ethnic cleansing in a few months.
The biggest penalty, which could be charged with a crime against humanity, says the sentence is a life sentence.

In a statement after meeting with Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis said Greece wants to "overcome the challenges of the past and see the future".
Erdogan described 2008 as new opportunities to improve relations between the two countries.
Turkey and Greece have been proud, but political relations have improved in recent years, despite disagreements over the air space and staff.
The two NATO allies have returned from the war in 1987 and 1996 due to a sovereignty dispute over oil and gas, and two small-sovereignty over the Aegean Sea.
The Turkish and Greek prime ministers agreed on Wednesday to boost bilateral co-operation, but the Cyprus issue, a political sensitive Greek Orthodox season in Istanbul, continues to discuss issues related to the Turkish minority and Turkish minority in Turkey.
They promised to work together to resolve the long-standing dispute over the borders of the Aegean Sea, but agrees on these efforts to be used.
Karamanlis reiterated Athens' stance to decide on the issue at The Hague International Court of Justice, while Erdogan continued to seek a bilateral solution.
Meanwhile, the stalemate in efforts to reunify the divided Cyprus island has blocked Turkey 'EU accession process.
In December 2006, Brussels frozen the opening of the 35 negotiating chapters over Cyprus.
Cyprus joined the EU, claiming that the island represented the entire island in May 2004.
The KKTC, however, is recognised by the Turkish part of the island and is only recognised by Turkey.
"Turkey must be normal relations with Cyprus for the EU bid," Karamanlis said, adding that the organisation should accept Turkey as a full member after Ankara fulfils all its obligations to the EU.
In response, Erdogan said diplomatic efforts on Cyprus are needed to speed up, and voiced hope that a new opportunity in February presidential elections would open.
Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, who was predecessor to reject the UN reunification plan in 2004, will be a candidate.
Turkish Cypriots have adopted a separate referendum and accepted the plan.
However, a reunification Cyprus must be accepted in both sides, as a reunification can enter the EU.

About 280,000 Macedonians will increase the average of 15% this month in pensions.
Earlier this month, the government decided to replace a 10% increase in all sectors.
Speaking at a press conference, Labour and Social Policy Minister Ljupco Meskov said the new increase between 20% and 10% will bring the salaries.
According to Meskov, the government will increase the lowest salaries by 20%, and the salaries of 100 to 170 euros will be reduced by 15% to 15%, and salaries on 240 euros will be 10%.
Around 120,000 pensions, two injuries, 110,000 and 35,000 in the fourth group, the minister said.
About 97% of the pensions began to take this week, while the increase of the rest will begin in July.
Meskov described it as a huge step for the government, as the average pension is determined by average wages.
"With this compliance, pensions will approach the stage of salaries," Meskov said.
The figures could be possible for more than 9.4% of the 9.4% of the Pension and Insurance Fund.
It is expected to increase this year.
Other contributions include a fixed tax rates, and reducing the country ’ s registered economy.
In addition to the forecast, the government has increased in financial disciplinary.
The pension hike was made by the IMF 'rhetoric.
While the budget deficit targets 1.5% of GDP, the costs are believed to be part of a low inflation and low interest policy, Fund representatives say.
For the first time in 15 years, the rise of the basic needs was sparked by a time when the prices of prices of basic needs were increased.

Kostunica ’ s support could be expensive to Serbian leader Tadic
Local media reported that Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica have agreed on support in the presidential run-off, but the agreement remains uncertainly uncertainty.

Belgrade media reported that Serbian President Boris Tadic and Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica reached an agreement ahead of the 3 February presidential run-off, but parties are doing it.
In exchange, Kostunica told the daily Blic, he must oppose the EU to send its mission to Kosovo if it does not comply with a new decision from the UN Security Council.
Tadic also wants the prime minister to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
According to the paper, Kostunica will announce his support for Tadic on Friday (January 25th) after signing a energy agreement with Russia in Moscow.
Belgrade analysts say the support of Kostunica could be postponed in the second round.
Tadic will face the second round of elections with the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, Tomislav Nikolic, who won 4% more votes in the first round.
Kostunica 'support will play an important role in determining the winner in February.
However, the Kostunica party asked Tadic on Wednesday to change a coalition agreement during the current government.
The Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) is calling for further policy on the EU, and the party wants the SAA to not be signed if the EU is sent to Kosovo without a UN mission.
The DSS says a EU mission to send Kosovo would violate the sovereignty of Serbia.
The platform of Tadic is focused on European integration.
"Hajdi was Europe in the Union," he said.
"In Kosovo, Europe is thought to think it is about the future of this country, and all those who are doing them during these years.
And I will not allow anyone to be a key condition.
"I will fight until the last stage, and I will prepare to disaster this path, but I will not allow anyone to make conditions for a better Serbia and better life," he said.
The Hungarian and Croatian minorities have supported the president, but Tadic 'winner is unlikely to win without Kostunica' supporters.
For the opposition Serbian Socialist Party of Serbia, Nikolic believes Tadic will be forced to capture the Radical Party candidate for the Radical Party.
Nenad Canak, leader of the League of Vojvodina Social Democrats in Vojvodina, has accused Kostunica of preparing to form a ruling coalition with Radicals after the second round of elections.
For now, however, there is no signal that it is something.
Former Yugoslavia War Crimes War Crimes War Crimes Still Local courts
In September, the state court in Bosnia and Herzegovina issued its first indictment against war crimes.
Though the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is prepared to close its doors in 2010, cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), such as other parts of the former Yugoslavia have been seen in local courts.
The court is planning to continue to trial in The Hague, such as the former Yugoslav head of state, Slobodan Milosevic, and to hand over more false cases.
Observers suggest that the trials in local courts have an important impact on public opinion and would increase the level of unknown war crimes.
However, concerns that local courts are not ready to exercise these cases.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), a recent indictment of war crimes prosecutors by state tribunal prosecutors, the state court 'indictment was indicted by local courts in the Balkans in 1990, a part of regional efforts to judge war crimes committed during the 1990s conflict in the Balkans, 45, and Abdul Maktouff, 45, were also charged in 1993 for a prison and abuse of Serb and Cro
This case is crucial for the first war crimes indictment by the BiH state court in January 2003, a top international official in the country, High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
The indictment was drafted by prosecutors in the special part of the tribunal 'financial crimes, organised crime and corruption, which are working with international judges and prosecutors, domestic colleagues.
The special war crimes agency, which will operate in January, will reflect the structure of the private zone.
"It is the first jazz case with us," said John McNpoet, head of the BiH state prosecutor and private zone, as well as foreign Muslim wars who arrived in BiH during the conflict.
Following the attacks on the United States on September 11th 2001, there will be an increasingly concern about some of the remaining people in BiH participated in terrorism groups, but the jail issue is a very sensitive issue.
As the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is prepared to close its doors in 2010, cases in other parts of the former Yugoslavia have begun to be seen in local courts. The BiH war crimes agency will also work with the same prency when it comes to the beginning of 2005.
Since 1993, the ICTY has been formed, more than 40 defendants have been implemented since 1993. According to the strategy, which will be implemented by 2010, the tribunal will continue to continue the leaders of Yugoslavia, such as former state chief Slobodan Milosevic.
According to some court observers, the proceedings could be a difficult textile for domestic judges, who have not shown that they have yet to show fair and prevention.
The latest developments at the Centre for War and Peace Relations in London are "worried" in parliament, as the manager of the project in the courts' Institute for War and Peace Relations, Ana Uharlac, described the failure of the laws on war crimes in parliament as a "concern", but the cases have not been seen as
Local courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina take over some cases from The Hague. [File]
"It is optimistic to think that the courts will begin, creation of the law system and the experience of judges and prosecutors' prosecutors, but will be better," Uharlac said.
Croatia, for instance, has been formed in Zagreb, Osijek, Rijeka and Split, on the issue, instead of several smaller courts that have achieved different consequences, but all of the number of small-smaller courts that have reached different consequences.
According to a analyst, the problem in smaller courts is that these courts' decisions can be rejected by the top court. The case, which continued to be indicted by the defendant in Karlovac on September 1991, is an example of the situation.
Vesna Terselic, a former adviser at the Institute for Peace Studies in Karlovac, said the case was launched third time in a local court. "Although the top court has been offered for the release of the defendant, the court has sent the decision, insisting that the killings are under way," he said.
He also said the courts are facing local public pressure and that pressure in Zagreb will not be high.
Judges have been passed in a education process with the ICTY, but the courts have not yet won uncertainty in the cases.
According to Terselic, The Hague tribunal is a very important institution and the local courts are possible to form a council, but the issue of crimes committed at the local level is crucial.
"In our country, the courts are really realistic about the public.
"All the former Yugoslavia are taking place in different places, and this is the best way that can be," he said.
In Serbia, the six-nation Open, indicted in Vukovar in 1991, began in Belgrade in March.
The ongoing court is seen as a test of the Serbian legal system.
In Kosovo, the last two years of war crimes cases and other international and domestic judges have been conducted by the delegation of international and domestic judges. According to an Adviser, some cases, including war crimes are being carried out by international law, local courts and prosecutors are positive.
"In this practice, it is under pressure on domestic judges that will be concerned for the safety of civilians," said UNMIK justice department head Thomas Monaghan.
According to Monaghan, the textbook that the BiH state court must be able to take the example of Kosovo should be a quickly speed. "The most important point in the war crimes cases, while investigating and as possible judiciary is a fast judiciary.
The witnesses, question and the number of expression, are more willing to witness.
"It is a regret process, not to tackle all details."
McNpoet said the outcome of war crimes cases will be made without any consequence in BiH if the process has been achieved.
"We did not choose this case because it is certain, or the perpetrators of the perpetrators," McNet said, adding that the cases of serious crimes, such as the other cases, have been important in serious cases, and that the effects of the defendants are taking into account their policies or economic situation.
Serbian Telecom Discuss Progress
The sale of Serbian Telecom in 1997 has also brought charges of bribes and support for the former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic regime.
A investigation has been launched in Italy to examine corruption allegations.
By Davor Konjikusic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 11 / 11 / 03
Former director of the Bank of Belgrade, Borka Vucic, dismissed allegations that Serbian Telecom shares sell to foreigners in 1997 have been spent on illegal roads.
He said the money was not used to support the former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic regime.
In an interview with Italian news agency Ansa, Vucic said Yugoslavia won 1.5 billion euros from the contract.
According to the former general manager, 1,2 billion DM was transferred to the Yugoslav Development Fund through Belgrade, while the government used the money to pay pensions and closed their statements in health and other social services.
Vucic said the remaining 300m DM was sent to the Yugoslav National Bank.
Following reports in Italian media in early 2001 that the Italian entity was launched in Rome over the sale of Serbian Telecom, Serbian Telecom was launched.
The bribes were invited by several high-level Italian officials, while Milosevic was allocated at a time when sanctions are implemented due to Kosovo, the daily Reosca reported.
As a result, a 29 per cent stake in Serbian Telecom (NGET) has begun to the Italian telecom company OTE, while the Greek telecom company bought 20 per cent.
The NGET paid a 702m DM on June 10th 1997, 48 hours after the agreement was signed.
The company paid 117 million DM for the next six months and 74m DM pays on March 1998.
Serbian Justice Minister Vladan Batic announced a recent announcement, saying the cases of 12 Serbian nationals would be seen in Belgrade to help investigate the investigation.
The proceedings will be closed and there are no information about the courts.
Italian Parliament Speaker Enco Trantino, head of the Italian Parliament Committee, said the court prosecutors in Torino, Italy, have decided to extend the investigation by the next summer.
He added that the committee is ready to send a delegation to The Hague for the "all of the case" to the Milosevic ".
Approximately the Olympic Games, Greece Says Terrorists' Relations
Following the Olympics scheduled for next year in Greece, authorities are taking measures against any kind of terrorism in the country.
By Dimitris Agrafiotis for Southeast European Times in Athens - 24 / 06 / 03
Last month, attacks by El-Qaeda in Riad and Kazabucka were the latest terrorist incidents in the Mediterranean region.
The warnings from terrorists and extremist groups continue operations and to foreign intellectual intelligence service have sparked losses in Greece over the possibility of explosive explosion within borders.
Officials, who are aware of the "minimum", are aware of the threats of threats.
There are many reasons for Greece to move forward.
The geographic position has become a disappointment for terrorism groups, due to the country is much easier for other European states.
Greece has strengthened the preservation of the long-deeply coastal coastal coastal coastal, bringing illegal impression.
According to the government &aposs perspective, one of the biggest dangers for national security is the Islamic dynamic groups that are becoming illegal immigrants to Greece.
Three years ago, many immigrants have been the green light of no significant investigation over criminal delays.
Therefore, there are possibilities that Islamic extremist groups have achieved documents that would allow people to stay in Greece.
Officials are Muslim immigrants who are currently under the closure of the authorities.
Despite these dangers, authorities that have implemented and the National Intelligence Service (EYP) have a strong position.
The EYP has entered closer co-operation with foreign intelligence service services in the coalition against terrorism, citing possible terrorism links.
Greek officials are concerned about a possible terrorist attack during the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
The aim of the El-al-Qaeda to cause massive losses in global activities has been passed by the Olympic Games Committee and the government.
As the most difficult task of the vote, visitors and visitors are in the government if they are able to ensure their safety.
With Greece joined the anti-terrorism coalition, the radical coup has been dismissed.
The country is part of the United States in the battle against El-al-Qaeda, which could make Greece a target of extremists in the country.
Greece, however, has little experience on the fifth terrorism.
Therefore, this new threat is a problem that law officials and the EYP must be imposed.
Ashdown Urges Bosnian Serb Officials for Mladic
Paddy Ashdown criticised Bosnian Serb officials on Tuesday after new findings that fugitive war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic were involved in the Republika Srpska Army archives by 2002.

The new findings, including key war crimes fugitives from the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), have sparked strong criticism from High Representative Paddy Ashdown.
The Sarajevo daily Dnevnik published a report on Tuesday (November 30th) that wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic is a military shelter.
The document shows that Mladic was exported only two years ago from the Republika Srpska (RS) military.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has accused Mladic of war crimes, including genocide in late 1995.
Mladic, along with former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and retired General Ante Gotovina, is the list of most wanted indictees to The Hague tribunal.
According to the report, Mladic was exported from the RS Army (VRS), in March 2002 with the decision by the time RS president Mirko Sarovic.
Ashdown said the VRS is "scandal" for the worker relationship, which is not only two years ago, with the fugitive claiming that the VRS does not know.
The top international envoy in BiH said it is "a demonstration that RS authorities, especially VRS, have violated their obligations to the Dayton Community and the International Court in The Hague".
The document, published by the Dnevni Avaz newspaper, has been supported by ICTY chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte last week to speak at the UN Security Council, Ashdown 'office said on Tuesday.
"I believe that in BiH, in particular, the law enforcement and security structures in RS, there are basic weaknesses that have been replaced in RS," the prosecutor said on November 23rd, criticising RS authorities for failing to arrest one of the indictees wanted by the ICTY.
"This is your question that the VRS has continued to avoid Mladic, and what is the willingness of the military to co-operate with the ICTY?" Ashdown said. "If the RS wants to seek a modern European future."
The document, published by the Sarajevo newspaper, which Mladc continued his activist to the Yugoslav Army (VD) until 2001, has been claiming that RS authorities and the VRS relations between 2000 and 2001.
"If Mladic is registered to both the VD and the VRS, this reason is why the staff claimed that they were discovered by authorities in 2000 and 2001?" Ashdown said.
The new findings came days before the NATO summit on December 9th.
At the end of June, the Alliance postponed the invitation to join the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme, due to BiH fails to fulfil its obligations to the ICTY.
The BiH daily RTNA news agency quoted the German ambassador to the country, Fremon Kittendorf, as saying on Tuesday that BiH is waiting for a meeting of the PfP at the summit in December.
The NATO report, which del Ponte has submitted to the Security Council, will be convinced, the diplomat said.
Turkey to Reform Reforms on Su Policy
Turkey has to bring its laws with the Union as an EU candidate.
The country is preparing to reform its tightening policy on cross-border resources and water resources to ensure EU criteria and international laws.

Turkey is preparing to reform the tightening policy of cross-border resources and water resources to ensure EU criteria and international legal obligations.
The country 'foreign affairs ministry has made two working groups to prepare a new water ban on Turkey' needs and the EU Su Framework Process, which will take place in the institutions.
As a EU candidate, Turkey must bring its laws with the Union, including laws concerning its own resources.
Ankara hopes to launch accession talks with the EU in 2005, if the Union is able to become a green light at the summit this month.
The EU and Turkey have called for Turkey to accept water standards in the Union, signed in 2003 between the EU and Turkey.
As the country needs to protect its resources, the international law must form a balance between the days of comments that must make the effect of water policies on neighbouring countries.
The cross-border reserves have 40 per cent of the Turkish water potential.
In particular, the Middle East said their countries will live serious water shortages over the next 25 years, and Turkey will be among the main resources of its transport.
Two important water supplies from Turkey -- Dicle and First rivers -- have been caused for a long-term dispute between Syria and Iraq. In the 1990s, the country wants to send more water supplies to Syria and Iraq, but the country has decided to build the poor economic growth in the poor areas of Turkey to build 700 water metres to Syria.
With Ankara signed the latest international agreement on cross-border supplies, Syria will need to receive approval of a barrier on First.
Turkey has long-term needs to be considered.
Many experts cautioned that the country can live before the fast city and industrialised outcome of 2030.
Although the foreign ministry is prepared to develop a more flexible policy, the measures are also under way.
Ankara will likely be under pressure on Syria and Iraq to acknowledge that Dicle and Firat have a single airport, and will try to harm international law obligations.
In addition, Turkey will require the participation of the countries that have only exercise debates on water rights, which are trying to block the intervention of third individuals.

Rather celebrations in Romania
Romania was on the road to EU membership in 1999.
The European Commission said on Tuesday that the country and its neighbouring Bulgaria will join the Union on 1 January 2007, as planned, but it would be possible under the most competitive conditions that have been implemented so far.

"The EU is important," European Liberal MP Graham Watson said in a speech at the European Parliament (EP), discussed the future of the bloc. "The EU needs many countries that share our values as possible to help us overcome serious challenges."
Watson welcomed the European Commission (EC) decision to recommend its membership in Romania and Bulgaria on January 1st 2007, as many of the leaders of the European Parliament, as well as the Group leaders in the European Parliament.
According to EC President Jose Manuel Barroso, the two Balkan countries "have a historic success of the Union", which is more safe and strong.
Barroso also urged the bloc to be given to the European Constitution to resolve the European Constitution, but assured other candidates that the doors are not closed.
"We will stay on the promises when we have the accession perspective," Barroso said.
Romans, meanwhile, did not leave the cautious during the celebrations.
President Traian Basescu has warned the country cannot be closed.
"Any response that we will be rich when we entered the EU is now rich, it will not be a lot of other.
"We have been here in a climate that has invited us," he said.
Romania has reached the aim of a long-awaited reform process.
However, Basescu said, "the areas that have shown middle performance".
These shortcomings said in a new monitoring report by the EC submitted to the European Parliament.
A industrial agriculture has been worried.
"It is still true that the payment agencies have not been able to work," he warned.
As a result, Romania could lose 25 per cent of EU agricultural funds.
The EC faces a difficult task.
Following the green light, some willingness EU member states -- France and Germany, which have not yet approved the accession treaty of Bulgaria and Romania.
While praising "sustainable progress in both countries, Barroso assured European lawmakers that the EC would establish a mechanism for the post-accession co-operation and progress.
Both countries will require a report to the EC in six months.
Judicial reform, anti-corruption measures and the criteria in the fight against organised crime will still meet.
If no country does not meet these criteria, the EC will be able to enhance a special protectorate that would suspend its obligation to recognise the court decisions in the country.
Some EU officials, such as the head of the EC Committee in Bucharest, acknowledge that this protective arbitration could be a "robbery" that would affect the citizens of more.
In Brussels, however, it is seen as a pressure on Bucharest and Sofia to continue the necessary reforms.

Bulgarian officials met on Tuesday (September 26th) with the European Commission (EC) decision on countries and neighbouring Romania to become a member of the EU on 1 January 2007, despite the lack of circumstances.
"This is the real and final fall of the Berlin Wall," Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev said.
President Georgi Parvanov told Darik Radoski that EU membership is the most viable historic project for Bulgaria 'future.
Bulgaria has signed a lot of agreements in the past, but it is a step forward to the same disaster with other European countries, Parvanov added.
In its latest monitoring report on the progress of the two countries' EU membership, the EC said both countries have made a "extraordinary reform process" after the fall of communism in late 1989, and that a clear transformation has been transformed ".
During a press conference with Stanishev in Sofia on Wednesday, EC President Jose Manuel Barroso said EU membership would lead Bulgaria to economic and social development and bring stronger to the Union.
While there is no reason for voluntary exchange, Barroso said, urging authorities to focus on the implementation of needed reforms.
Bulgaria and Romania, which are prepared to become the 27th and 27th members of the Union, have been implemented.
If these conditions do not meet in the first three years of membership, the two countries could be implemented in the accession treaty.
The EC said it would establish strong monitoring mechanisms to ensure that both countries have made actions.
At the same time, Sofia and Bucharest will be able to submit a report on both months, including in implementing the necessary measures, on 31 March.
Bulgaria must take urgent actions to address all the lack of air security in the field.
Otherwise, the EC could block Bulgarian air companies to enter the bloc 'banking market.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, who serves in Sofia on Wednesday, said the lack of protective measures involved in the accession treaty depends on Bulgaria.

UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said the idea of violence against the Kosovo issue is "evidence". [AFP]
During a three-day visit to Pristina, UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari and his deputy, Albert Rohan, said stability is very important in the process of resolving the Kosovo status issue and that violence will not be given a role in the province &aposs future.
"Special Envoy could do everything in the mandate of any individual or group within the authority of the UN, if it does not help move forward," Ahtisaari said at a press conference Wednesday (November 23rd).
The Security Council members have signaled that they will support stability measures if such steps should be taken, he added.
Rohan reiterated that the Kosovo Contact Group urged all sides to stop unilateral steps and reject any violence. "All the international community is really realistic.
[Ibrahim Rugova], as the president] is [Ibrahim Rugova], "he said.
These remarks came after a secret militant group, who ordered him as the Kosovo Independent Army (KBO), ordered threats.
In a statement disbanded local media, the group threatened to launch an attack against Pristina, saying "a modern worker is under control".
The group also urged members of the Kosovo Police Service (KPT) and members of the Kosovo Service League to participate in the violence campaign.
The KBO was first two months ago in Dukagjini, part of the southern Kosovo border.
The swimming and armed persons have reportedly stopped here and recommended that the UN and other international organisations would not be able to live in this region, after they were complained to their personnel.
On November 16th, the explosive explosion of an KPT vehicle was damaged.
A day later, four Serbian teenagers were injured in a crowd air market in Sterpce, eastern Kosovo, where the majority was in the Serbian town of Sterpce.
UNMIK described it as terrorism, but has not yet been clear whether it is linked to the KBO.
UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen said that the use of violence is "evidence", adding that "we are prepared to respond to any provocation."

The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Monday (March 31st) to open a case against the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) to undermine its secular system.
One judge decided to see the case by Turkish republic prosecutor Abdurahman Yaleta, who opened the case.
"The Constitutional Court has found the indictment of the prosecution.
However, this does not mean that the high-level court has accepted allegations in the indictment, "he said." Now, this case will be imposed. "
The scandal was inaugurated on March 14th, with the party to adopt the law.
Prosecutor accused the AKP of becoming a "genocide point", and claimed the party had a "secret agenda" to turn Turkey into a Islamist country.
The 71 officials, including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul, have called for politics for the fifth year.
The court has been divided over a case against Gul, with four judges, and others voted in the case.
According to the constitution, a president can only be tried by the citizens.
The general secretary-general of the National Action Party (MHP), Chan Pact, was the first to comment on the decision.
"The legal process now will begin.
Everything should respect the Constitutional Court decision, "he said.
The AKP does not recognise him as a conservative democracy party.
The party won a clear victory by 47% of the elections last year.
Earlier this month, a move created in secularism has managed to eliminate the ban on headscarves in universities.
According to Yalalsa, this move is proof that the party is trying to spread Turkey to religious mistakes.
The prosecutor also cited variety of speakers that Erdogan has been admitted to the Islamic and exercise law, in which the prosecution claimed 162 page.
He is expected to continue six months.
First, the Constitutional Court will send the indictment to the AKP, and the party will have to prepare a defence declaration within a month.
Following that, the scandal will seek a technical opinion on the case.
Officials of the AKP will then tackle their own defence.
As the process is completed, the Constitutional Court &aposs report will prepare a technical report.
After the report was prepared, 11 members of the Constitutional Court will seek the document.
Nevertheless, they will meet to convict the case.
At least seven judges must vote to close the AKP.
Eight of 11 judges in the council were appointed by former President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a female secularist with the AKP.
The ruling party, meanwhile, is planning to change a series of constitutional changes that will make the party more difficult.
However, because opposition parties are unwilling to support the proposed changes, they could have to be able to submit public approval by a referendum.

Tourists in the Tivat coastal city of Tivat, Montenegro, where former Russian aircraft produced, are reminded, and the house of the Boka Kotor in the region and near Boka.
Media reports suggest the Freedom has been working even with cars.
The Montenegrin government has suggested that Russian aircraft would not be invited to Podgorica Airport.
The airport has more flexibility capacity and will not affect the tourism sector.
The government, however, does not want to give up the two types of Russian aircraft by 86 and Todev 154 types of types of type flights to Montenegro for about 100,000 Russian tourists annually.
Experts are opposed to the ban on tourist vacations that have been transferred to the Montenegrin Riviera.
They want to use two Russian aircraft due to low quality costs and passenger capacity.
According to the Montenegrin media, the government will work to transport Russian plants from Tivat to Podgorica this summer, but the first will be chosen to 86 and Todev to 154 for 2009.
At the same time, the government will take time to see alternative operators to Russian aircraft.
The law will leave a half hour-hour job from Russian tourists to Podgorica Airport.
Despite the possible effect of this increasing travel period, Tivat supports local authorities and the general public preparations when it comes to Freedom.
All signals will not affect the tourism of the additional travel period.
Snezana Veynovic, the head of the Association of Budva Tourism Authorities, for example, said Russian tourists are still interested in Montenegro this year.
"Although the prices increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year, many were reserved in early holidays," Veynovic said.
In addition, many Russian tourists seek investment opportunities.
Montenegro announced a 2.3 million foreign tourists last year.
In addition, the World Tourism and Industry Council announced that the tourism sector is estimated by 10% over the next ten years.
Despite death deaths in BiH

Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said earlier this month the opening of a new mechanism campaign, but almost 4% of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have been closed with cars, and that 900,000 people live near the border are endangered.
Since the end of the conflict, Spiric said that 480 people were killed and about 1,140 people were injured.
The fifth of the incidents, 39, are training experts, another intellectual workers.
In addition, 50 workers were injured.
In March, six workers died in a week.
The first was killed in Doboy on 17 March.
Two employees were killed and one were injured in a car near Spirani.
Three days later, three others near Gorazde -- two police officers and a NGO -- died.
Although the overall threat of the verdict has declined, BiH will have a long time to claim that it is impossible.
Experts say the cleaning will be at least ten years and will need about 4.9 million vehicles annually to support their work.
Others say this could receive ten years.
It is a major problem of unsustainable weapons.
In addition, they can create "mines" between the public, as the territorial losses and the territorial era, as well as the chances of individual incidents.
BiH praises the potential to become an effective natural beautiful beautiful, and tourists.
However, the problem is an obstacle.
This danger lives in eastern activities such as the camp and eastern rally.
The former Yugoslav National Army (JNA) was the fourth largest military force in Europe.
Several swimming personnel and ancient property produced.
During the conflicts on the former Yugoslavia, all sides were above the JNA military arms and have these dangerous weapons.
If the actual progress has been made, the entities are also on various products from illegal passengers.
So far, there has been a significant cleaning study.
Several companies participated in the studies, where both from several countries and their equipment support.
Nevertheless, BiH is still a high risk country.
Most of the victims are children.
Others include pharmaceutical coups and cars.
Those who are on the grounds are also spread, and they report the damage of cards that are damaged by regular cards.
Following the March death in March, workers who were deployed near Doboy have found 122 cars and had an effective effect.
Since that, work has been suspended.
The European Commission estimates that 67,000 mines and about 650,000 explosive explosives are still affected by a Mine Action Plan for 2009, but the international community will need to intervene for implementation.

The controversial law that helps indictees indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was blocked by the Serbian Constitutional Court earlier this month.
The debate on the law sparked almost two divisions in the ruling coalition in Serbia.
Constitutional Court President Slobodan Vucetic said the decision is not a clear conviction of the constitution.
According to him, the decision was "an interim movement that has blocked the implementation of the law".
The vote, which envisions the adoption of the law on March 30th, was the Socialist Party and the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party.
Then, Human Rights Committee argued the law is unconstitutional.
Speaking to the organisation, Biljana Kovacevic-Vuco welcomed the move of the constitutional court.
"This is a good decision and will ensure that relations within the ruling coalition will be achieved until time," he said, noting that Kovacevic-Vuco, Serbian Finance Minister and G17 Plus deputy head Mladjan Dinkic is to offer a proposal to change a part of the law.
The law, he said, would not accept all of the G17 Plus Socialists' demands, creates a "big risk" for the ruling coalition.
According to Ksenija Milivojevic, a member of the G17 Plus, the party tried to avoid certain irregularities in the law.
"The Serbian Constitutional Court welcomes the decision and we think that the committee is right to announce its position on the law," Milivojevic said.
Socialist Party senior official Ivica Dacic criticised the Serbian Constitutional Court, but said his party would comply with the decision.
Dacic said the Serbian government has not been at risk of Socialist support.
Government Reconstructs ICTY Co-operation
Serbia-Montenegro and Republika Srpska governments have begun to take steps to fulfil their obligations to the UN war crimes tribunal.
While the authorities are unwilling to hold a warrant, they hope that voluntary facilities will be accepted.

The two governments -- Serbia-Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina (RS) entity -- have started to take steps to fulfil their obligations to hand over indictees in recent weeks, as they do not co-operate with the UN war crimes tribunal.
However, these obligations do not mean the police 'doors at the night operations.
Even more, the former Serbian Army General Momcilo Perisic announced last week that he would surrender. He was on Monday (March 7th) to The Hague on the atrocities committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo between 1993 and 1998.
A analyst said authorities see them as a way to respond to international pressure without no political future.
"This situation is at least a large number of politicians, because they do not want to jeopardise their positions and jeopardise their prospects in the next elections," said Gabriel Parsov, the BBC analyst in Southeast Europe.
The international community, which includes the EU, the US government and NATO, is on BiH and Serbia-Montenegro.
Serbia and the United States are facing a double message from the EU and the United States: The arrest of war crimes indictees or to the EU, or to receive US aid.
retired General Vladimir Lazarevic, who faces charges against humanity and violations of war crimes committed during the 1998-1999 Kosovo conflict, is currently in The Hague only weeks after Washington has shown that Belgrade would not co-operate with the tribunal and suspended its failure to co-operate with the tribunal.
Washington also withdrew a group of experts that have provided technical support for the Serbian government.
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, meanwhile, cancelled a visit to Belgrade, saying the indictees are not surprised by falling their own in Serbia.
Following the problem, BiH has fought its invitation to join NATO 'Partnership for Peace (PfP), the top international manager in BiH, Paddy Ashdown, has caused the RS administration to replace dozens of officials.
The move came in response to a single war crimes indictee since the end of the 1992-1995 conflict.
Although the last post in December 2004 has led to resignation of the RS prime minister, Ashdown argues that the entity would be responsible for the entity if BiH rejects the PfP membership in April.
Prosecutor Todorovic and Boban Simic are on the way of RS police and EU peacekeeeping forces in January, which RS politicians are going to surrender by voters' stalemate.
"RS leaders do not want [to] nor before they do not want to stay on how they are possible -- and they want to be able to convince both the entity and the indictees to The Hague," he said. "Now they are now encouraging all indictees and encourage them to surrender. [They]
This is a substantial progress, but the actual actions must be revealed. "
Serbia-Montenegro Approves Economy

The IMF mission completed the review of a three-year financial arrangement with Serbia-Montenegro last month.
However, several key issues have not been reached and talks are under way.
The IMF Executive Board is expected to assess a positive assessment of Serbia &aposs economic policy, so that the delegation can give new loans under the 190m loan.
In an official statement, Fon analysts pointed to the expansion of macroeconomic balance, which endangers the country 'previous achievements.
In particular, the mission noted that Serbia-Montenegro has falling inflation by a large external account deficit of its GDP.
Furthermore, analysts cautioned that the government is not enough to take steps so far, saying the balance is slowly slow and the slowdown of privatisation and structural problems in public and state enterprises.
"In a environment where investments are hoping to increase the low current account account deficit in GDP, investments will need to be able to obtain access to economic growth and the current capital to the use of the current capital," the statement said. "Real and intelligence will be the possibility of constantial competitiveness, which is the only way to make consequences
"The government has drafted a plan to speed up privatisation, and Fon supports it," said the head of the IMF office in Belgrade. "However, the demand and and wage policy must be completed and cautious.
Most of the wages in the public sector should not get 7 per cent, as they are in the number of employees, "he said.
According to Miroslav Miskovic, head of the Delta Holding board, the privatisation process has been revealed so far.
"The competitiveness in the region is purchasing companies in Serbia and investments will be uncertain capital.
This is a positive thing, but we are facing significant obstacles that we are not going to do in these countries. "
Meanwhile, economist Miroslav Probisevic said that the defendants' economic policy of Serbia -- two things -- improving inflation and intensified foreign currency -- should focus on this year.
Economic growth will not be based on foreign hygis, insufficient economic policies and cheaper loans, Probisevic said, warning that insufficient economic policies will be expensive in the future.
The target of the inflation of state debt payments by 9.1 per cent this year, he noted, could be able to increase by 21 per cent to 21 per cent.

Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Talat pledged on Monday (March 7th) that if the North Cyprus Republic of Northern Cyprus (KKTC) won the presidential elections on 17 April, people would defend their interests in the international arena.
"I understand the responsibility of the Turkish Cypriot people to present the will of the international community," the leader of the Republican Turkish Cypriot Party (CTP) told reporters after being nominated as president.
Talat will replace Rauf Denktash, 81, who won the elections next month, and will serve as the chief negotiator of the KKTC in the future talks with Greek Cypriots.
Last year, the CTP leader dismissed Denktash 'plan to reunite Cyprus, when Denktash opposed violence.
However, efforts to end the Mediterranean island over 30 years to end the ongoing division of the Mediterranean island dropped after Greek Cypriots rejected a plan in April.
The majority of Turkish Cypriots supported the proposed peace agreement, but Cyprus joined the EU on 1 May 2004, because the KKTC does not recognise international recognition.
Talat was disbanded in October, when the previous government coalition, led by the Turkish Cypriot president, Serdar Denktash, led by the Democratic Party (DP).
However, he was more powerful in the KKTC parliamentary elections on February 20th, citing his party in the early parliamentary elections.
The CTP won 24 seats in parliament, with a clear increase of seven seats.
Talat, who promised to work to resume peace talks during the campaign, was considered a sign of the Turkish Cypriot community 'strong support for Cyprus' reunification and EU membership.
Talat, who took his mandate to form the new Turkish Cypriot government on Friday, is expected to head the new band CTP-DP coalition cabinet.
The CTP will receive seven ministerial ministries under a provisional ruling share agreement late Sunday.
The DP will be given three ministries.
The final agreement will be submitted to party leaders on Monday, while the suspension is expected to take place on Tuesday.
According to reports, the ministerial candidates will be submitted to the approval of Denktash on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Albania, electricity and the country await
The lack of a safe electricity supplies in Albania is not only the citizens, but investors do not express their investors.
However, the new manager to the state power institution is becoming more likely to expect the country.

The transition of democracy in Albania is forced to bring the public to large pharmaceutical.
The biggest problem for citizens is instability for a long time of electricity supplies.
During the former regime, the number of people who need electricity in the period of the former regime has eased to meet this request, and even the country was in its energy exports.
In the new Albania, the situation has been in other countries -- an increasingly worse power problem since 1990.
Many Albanian citizens have acknowledged that this electricity problem is part of a day.
Albania is not the only one of the problem in the region, when it comes to electricity cuts.
The situation in neighbouring Kosovo is the same.
Balkan countries live the negative effects of the closure of the nuclear plants from the Soviet era in Bulgaria.
Albanians every year say the latest season of the life is the worst of the season, so far.
Last day, electricity cuts and gasoline energy agencies have been really difficult.
Nevertheless, there is a lot of time, but now it seems to be a repeat.
Gjergj Bojaxhi, the new head of the Albanian Electricity Company, is a new generation manager, after the United States is training.
The World Bank and other private financial institutions have a serious experience in their country, but also gives a serious experience.
Bojaxhi also served as deputy minister of the Ministry of Trade, Economy and Energy.
The Hidropower plant is working on plans to open. [Gent Shuklaku]
Bojaxhi, 33, joined the KESH in March and is now one of the most difficult tasks in the country.
The success of electricity distribution has a very serious consequences -- the energy issue is possible to win elections or lose the same reason.
Bojaxhi should be monitored to convince both Albania and Albania, and a solution that would convince foreign investors who are concerned about the problem of electricity cuts in the country.
So far, the study points to a long and short term, and Bojaxhi shows that many solutions have the credibility and motivation that could implement a step.
Albania has some details on energy production.
It also depends on hydropower and climate conditions.
Currently, the lowest amount in the country, and reserves are the institution.
As a result, only 50 per cent of the electricity needs.
Instead, it is possible to import electricity, but also an expensive option.
The state budget has to meet its electricity needs from other countries.
What is the solution?
According to Bojaxhi, various methods should be cleared.
Bojaxhi focuses on boosting efficiency and to ensure that employees will depend on their jobs.
With the media, Albania is concerned about the situation, and more important is to organise a variety of campaign to convince people who use electricity money.
The privatisation of the institution is not on the agenda, and is focusing on the modernisation of existing facilities and construction of new power plants. [Gent Shkolaku]
Some parts of Albania have a bad precedent in order to pay electricity bills and to avoid mines for electricity.
Commercial users have almost unprecedented shield about the payment of the bills, while biothy consumer consumers, particularly the northern part of the country, do not exist to pay bills.
About 25 per cent of the users are paying their bills.
Bojaxhi, whose consumers are planning to foster electricity, was the first KESH manager to really stop the problem in order to resolve the problem.
This is only a first step.
The long-term solutions, which will allow KESH to provide a safe and stable power supply service, are being invested.
The institution, for example, is planning to privatise distribution revenues within the next two years.
Bojaxhi believes the consequences will be improved in the private sector, with a consequent approach, improving the control of the distribution repreneurs.
The new communication line between Elbasan and Podgorica will bring the electricity line, imported by the users' users', more translated.
The plans to build a oil plant in Vlora, south of the country.
The construction of a new hydropower plant in the north is planned.
It is also possible to develop small-smaller projects in Albania.
International donors also contribute to improving the problem.
Meanwhile, some say the public could be able to provide more austerity by attracting electricity prices.
According to Bojaxhi, this is not possible.
In the country, the prices have been made more serious than a year ago, and a new increase will create a great social property for many Albanians.
Bojaxhi says the decline could be seen after the supply problem is resolved.
The privatisation of the institution is not on the agenda, but the country is focusing on modernisation of existing facilities and construction of new power plants.
Bojaxhi acknowledges the problems will continue over the next two years.
The foreign investors, who need to need missile electricity supplies, hope that Albania will be a permanent solution to this issue, the most serious problem facing Albania.

Authorities announced on Wednesday (October 26th) that the labour stock types of H5N1 types of types of types of female female in eastern Croatia.
With Britain, Romania, Russia and Turkey, Croatia became the fifth European country in the death massacre.
The case in Croatia was confirmed by the EU female female referendum laboratory in Weybridge, Britain, which was comprised of the papers from the Zauci national park last week.
Experts believe all of the fans are frozen from Croatia to Hungary.
In recent weeks, about 1,500 immigrants fled to Croatia by monitoring one of the main routes of immigrants.
Since Croatian authorities were destroyed, more than 17,000 channels, including 3km of natural park in a bid to control the massacre of the death massacre.
Other measures include inflation in the region and the entire region is under way.
More than 60 people have been killed in Asia since 2003.
Most of the victims have a couple of couples, which are not direct with patients.
While people are difficult to pull against the unit, experts fear that it would turn into a beautiful beautiful, turning into a beautiful beautiful beautiful, which can easily be easily easily.
In Europe earlier this month, dangerous such a danger was destroyed in Turkey, Romania and Russia.
On Wednesday, Britain announced it was also seen as the second post in a week after a week: the H5N1 unit, which is imported from South American.
Two of the sides were killed in the house.
Meanwhile, the other European countries, including France, Hungary and Slovenia, are awaiting the consequences of the type of female female weapons on their territory.
The preliminary preliminary excavations in Germany have been found in preliminary crowds, and there are additional ways to learn whether it is H5N1.
Greece, meanwhile, announced it will host a health ministries conference on November 19th to discuss a joint action plan to be implemented against the threat of flu threat.

Serbia-Montenegro ’ s new defence law has a difficult military service to women
According to the new defence bill in Serbia-Montenegro, women will be able to call for smaller military units to get education and serve.

According to the proposed defence bill proposed by the Federal government, women in Serbia-Montenegro will be formed in the future.
The meaning of this is not the normal army.
However, women from 19 and 50 are able to call for "the necessary information and education" during the war, and they can have to serve forces.
Under the law, women who chose a professional military service will be recognised "for the eastern movement, reduced family hours and other judges on children".
Women with Hamand women will not be called for soldiers who have children under the age of ten, or their colleagues.
There is only one of the most important intellectuals that have been prevented in the draft law on women 'military service.
Another possibility is to pay for the "purchase of military service" -- instead of the reality.
This option will be beneficial for Serbs who live abroad and do not want to delay their careers by meeting a obligation in their own citizens.
This will be set by the Council of Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro.
"Our representatives of the diaspora have suggested the purchase of the military service to 1,000 euros, while the price service in Turkey is 5,000 euros.
The Diaspora ministry believes this should be between 2,000 and 2,500 euros, "he said.
Several NGOs, however, do not see the best way to resolve the problem of men in the peacekepers living abroad.
Such a system has created an unfair discrimination against those who do not comply with the economic force, the organisations say.
"Several countries have discovered the architects and removed only another relationship," said Petar Milicevic of the European Vici Bureau in Belgrade. "Even if the army is abroad, there is no rich and poor, there is no more money in a country, because there is no more voluntarily and no money in a country,
Milicevic acknowledges the bill shows a liberal liberalisation trend on military obligations in Serbia-Montenegro.
"This is clear that the military service is reduced to six months.
The armed service was 13 months, and the current bill will take six months.
We hope that this law will bring liberalising military service in a world where the overall trend is professional service, "he said.

The European Commission (EC) published a long-awaited progress report on Bulgaria and Romania &aposs bid to join the bloc earlier this week.
The EC said the two countries are likely to join the Union on 1 January 2007, as planned, but it could be possible to accelerate the reform process.
Otherwise, the security arbitration that would allow membership to be delayed by a year.
The EC cited organised crime and corruption as a source of concern, and urged Bulgaria to continue reforms in the judiciary and administration.
The commission also suggested that Romania, which has been resumed in the pre-accession process, could be able to cover its neighbour after the parliamentary elections in the treasury, following the parliamentary elections.
The report was complicated with the forecasts.
Several observers, including the European Parliament &aposs rapporteur for Bulgaria, Geoffrey van Orden, expect the EC to signal a slowdown in the process, particularly in Bulgaria.
Earlier this month, Van Orden told the Bulgarian bTV channel that recent EC Constitution has been under major pressure for criticism as possible because of its budget challenges.
In Bucharest and Sofia on Wednesday (October 26th), officials in Bucharest and Sofia pledged that the EC will act to implement its recommendations and prevent the delay of accession date.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Sergey Stanishev, who described the critics as unilateral, said this should be taken as a permanent warning to boost efforts.
Stanishev said the new government hopes this summer delays.
In Romania, EU Membership Minister Anca Boagiu said the EC report is the best "report on the country so far.
Furthermore, the EC has noted concerns about whether to be sentenced in corruption cases, Justice Minister Monica Makovey pledged on Wednesday that all high-level corruption cases will be tried to court.
The release of the report came about a month after 18 Bulgarian and 35 Romanian lawmakers participated in the European Parliament (EP) observers as a sign of confidence in the countries' aspirations for membership.
Although parliament is expected to be announced in a cabinet, the two countries were delayed due to concerns about their readiness to join the planned date.
"In this way, the Bulgarian and Romanian parliament will gain the work, procedures and working methods," the EP said in a statement published by parliament. "The two countries can join the EU and make it realistic that the people of the European Parliament will be really selected in the provocation of full members of the European Parliament."

At the summit of the tourism season, the coastal zones of Croatia are frozen with water cuts.
The Dalmatia region has been spot, and the existing water supplies systems are not enough for major circumstances, but the growing population is unable to meet the needs.
As a result, some areas have been given to water cuts.
The worst situation is in Big, a city in central Dalmatia.
At the same time, local governments entered each other on their symbols.
In one symbolic, water hour was given from 11 hours to 5 hours, while people remain unable to destroy the streets with the night.
He is visiting thousands of tourists.
However, this summer, some of them left.
Visitors do not want to pay a panel or a hotel if they did not get.
To find the problem, the military began water transport from other Croatian cities.
Authorities have invited tourists to return.
As a result, the crisis has been prevented for now.
In the long term, the water system must be renewed to resolve the problem.
Otherwise, Croatia can expect cuts and emergency measures every year, and this is not even hopeful for a country that is trying to develop the tourism sector.
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said they are in the hands of residents and the council.
Sanader promised that he will soon be given state support and will be built a new water system.
In this part of Croatia, water shortages are widespread, the situation was not worse.
Experts say more plans should be done before the tourist season are only the next one, but to wait to wait for the widespread tourist group and waste hotel enterprises.

However, tourism officials from both republics in the country are now trying to change the outcome of the past year. A dozen international tourism fair, which joined last year, was the first of the study.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina is known as a country where a difficult war is fought.
For that, it is thought to be a space and safe country, but the real situation is different.
In co-operation between the BiH Chamber of Commerce and Tourism and the Republika Srpska (RS) Ministry of Chamber of Commerce and Tourism, Bosnia and Herzegovina (RS) is trying to reflect the impression of a single country with a geography of geographical mountains, clean and change culture.
This is not always an effort in partnership.
So two years ago, the tourism channels in the federal parts of the country have been separate.

According to Van Eekmann, who is working in the economy part of the OHO, Bosnia and Herzegovina is a major job in economic development and promoting the peace climate in the country.
"It is clear, no one will not want to invest in a country without positive impression.
The effect of this situation is not limited with tourism, "he said, adding that" This broadcaster is the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as the last broadcaster in early February.
We know that the national parents in Koha and Sutjetska can see that the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina -- in which we see "losses" and eight of the former War growth in the city of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).
Amenovic is very important that Bosnia and Herzegovina can do this way -- the right cycle, radical paramilitary, Una, Neretva and Drina -- is not clear.
The country is "clearly clean and natural beautiful behaviour", he says. "There is a chance of tourism."
"We are interested in order to enter a ecological aspect of tourism, and this is a very important square point in Bosnia and Herzegovina to move on the development of tourism."
A letter operator in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which has been working for more than ten years, believes the best to develop ecological tourism.
Tim Capcy believes Bosnia and Herzegovina is a "fundamental" for an ecological tourism.
Capcy is working as a hyber and partner in the Sarajevo Green Vision tourist company.
The company walks the rally, falling and other events.
They are not based on major hotels, but also on the hydros, "he said.
Amenovic also noted the events of the tourist heritage, noting that Katolicians' cultural heritage are in the world and the Islamic and Orthodox historical architecture in Verugorje, where he arrived for his visit.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is working to promote all factors, Amenovic said, noting that people there are no residents in the work.
"One of the consequences we have valued, but the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina through tourism," he said.
Tourism pensions reflect the problems of the politics. [RS] Ministry of tourism] and we do not invite a great relationship in promotions that we have been partnership with the tourism fair, so that all negative consequences, "he added, adding that all the republics of the federal republics in the country are not only the best.
And everything is important -- a good camp or a new market for products -- can change the negative judges of foreigners to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and how they see their own countries and evaluate.
"There is no need to change the forms of people in Bosnia and Herzegovina," he said.
"Neretva is beautiful and should be accepted as an open true that should be seen in the case.
Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina could seek all residents, crowd Americans, as well as France has become France.
If we can achieve this, I am confident that the country will also increase its values. "

The new budget cuts have to take more to the front of their fans.

Starting this year, textbooks must be purchased by their literature. [classico.hr]
The global economic crisis declined to schools in Croatia, causing new austerity measures on the state budget.
For the first time, the school children will have to receive textbooks.
The books were met by the state as free.
As the children live, the parents will spend 100 to 250 euros to 250 euros for the school spending.
Only their families are under the poverty level, and the textbook of children and war veterans have been removed outside their textbooks.
"The tax revenues will have to pay more than the targeted targets due to poor decisions.
"We have to pay more money for something that was guaranteed by the state, but not fair," he said.
Kriz forced about 550,000 Croats to buy teachers this year.
In an effort to help local families, the old textbook book books have been used for those who have been submitted to the need for each other.
The consequences of solidarity have been unprecedented.
Those who do not have to buy the books that are not only in front of the books near their homes.
The books are being met by the state, and the country cost about 76m euros annually.
For each new teachers, teachers who have created teachers' plans for a different currency in each new textbooks have decided in textbooks of the year.
Such a practice process is completely complicated for those who are planning.
Violeta Nikolic, head of a primary school in Rijeka, believes that the school currency is equality in the school currency and that teachers have the best option to elect teachers' lessons.
Pero Lucin, a prominent expert on education, says it should be limited with only a few witnesses on the issue, if it is not a chance to choose teachers.
Meanwhile, www.com, which was operating last July, will serve as a mandate for free textbooks such as www.com, and helping the current textbook crisis in Croatia.

The Swedish Academy of Scientific Academy described Muller as "a writer" on the situation of the state property and the executive of the door.
"I am surprised by that, I do not believe," he said.
Following a day after the announcement of the Nobel committee, Muller did not violate that the award has been a relationship between the 20-year period since the fall of the Berlin Wall.
"I don ’ t think the award is a game with this, but I think it is a part of the communist regime," he said.
In an interview with the Nobel committee, Muller said, "It is still the highest level in Romania.
It was more than 30 years ago, when I have faced me, it was obstacle to them, they had the destruction of these clears, they found me, "he said.
They are more recognised in Germany, as they are in Romania.
Following the announcement of the Nobel committee, however, the Romanian media discovered the village of Nitchidorf near Merisoara to learn more about the Mults.
Muller, who arrived in 1953, reminded that Germany lives in the village, while writer Rumence was only 12.

In an interview published on Monday (July 31st), Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Serbia would not accept a solution to the Kosovo status issue even if the EU bid is damaged.
"Serbia will reject Kosovo a solution from Serbia, and most important will continue to see Kosovo as part of its territory," Kostunica told the Belgrade-based daily Danas.
According to the prime minister, some of the international community recommended that Serbia would give up Kosovo for EU membership.
Kostunica said some conditions have to be met for membership, but that "territorial concessions" are not part of them.
Kosovo is still part of Serbia, but the UN administration has been under UN administration since June 1999, when the 78 days of NATO intervention has been charged with Kosovo Albanian monopolies in the province, charged with several months of conflict between Serb forces charged with ethnic cleansing.
About 10,000 Kosovo Albanians died in the 1998-1999 conflict and nearly 800,000 were forced to leave their homes.
Today, around 100,000 ethnic Serbs are still live in the province, where 90 per cent of the population of 2 million ethnic Albanian majority.
The UN-led talks in a bid to determine the final status of Kosovo -- have not yet been achieved by a high-level summit on July 24th.
The two sides continue to stay very different positions, while Kosovo Albanians say they will not accept independence, Serbia insists that it can only accept "real autonomy".
According to Western diplomats, Reuters said the major forces in the status process do not see many alternative than independence, and the EU and NATO impression will be extended for years.
UN Special Envoy Marrti Ahtisaari is said to plan to congratulate the UN Security Council in September on status talks.
If the agreement cannot be reached, the Security Council could be based on a solution.
"Serbia will reiterate that Kosovo is part of Serbia," Kostunica said. "This is not a legal and constitutional formation."
The prime minister, however, met with recent remarks by Tomislav Nicolic, deputy leader of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, who said Serbia would "fight for Kosovo if Kosovo gave independence."
"Serbia has been applied to legal artefacts so far, but it is not a power," Kostunica said. "In the future, it will be accomplished."
Serbian Defence Minister Zoran Stankovic said on Monday that the army was not prepared for a wartime against Kosovo ’ s possibility.
"The armed conflict is nor we are willing to prepare the armed forces to participate in the armed conflict," Stankovic said during his visit to Novi Sad.
Meanwhile, the next two-day round of talks on Kosovo began on August 7th and is scheduled to focus on local reform and minority rights.
Bucharest is optimistic for EU Accession
Romanian officials are optimistic that the country will complete its preparations for joining the EU in time to achieve its entry target in 2007.
(FT - 23 / 01 / 04; RFE / RL, Rompres, Evenimentul Zilei, Seavroope, Novinite - 22 / 01 / 04; EU - 18 / 01 / 04)
Top Romanian officials have expressed confidence that the country will be ready to join the EU in 2007.
Despite the repeat of the 2004 election team, government officials have repeatedly repeatedly insisted that accession talks with Brussels will be given the first priority.
Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana told the Financial Times on Thursday (January 22nd) that his country has made "an extraordinary progress" in the past three years ", noting that Romania could be completely destroyed," Financial Times quoted Foreign Minister Mircea Geoana as saying on Thursday (January 22nd).
Romania, which began accession talks in February 2000, is expected to join the Union with its southern neighbour to Bulgaria.
Both countries hope to complete accession talks with the European Commission (EC) by the end of the year.
Romania completed 22 of the total 30 negotiating chapters, while Bulgaria completed 26.
Agence France Press recently quoted Geoana as saying that Bucharest and Romania will "make this job with the European Commission", which will end in October.
The Italian counterpart, Franco Frattini, also expressed optimistic about the prospects of the two countries.
Frattini told Italian Senate on Thursday that the two countries have any chance to complete negotiations in 2004, sign accession talks and achieve their historical goals to the EU.
Stressing that the two Balkan nations are part of "the same comprehensive and sustainable enlargement process", EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen called a similar message a day ago.
"The accession talks with Bulgaria and Romania have made significant progress," Verheugen said, urging countries to continue "the pace of efforts and reforms".
The EC said in its latest report on Romania in November that the country has made progress in the economy, but did not approve the "functioning market economy", a key precondition for EU membership.
The report also included weakness in the implementation of laws on corruption and the EU, especially in areas that have created concern.
Romanian President Ion Iliescu said his country will focus on European and Euro-Atlantic integration targets this year.
"I believe that the election process is insufficient to sell the campaign and competitiveness process," he said.

Following a 11-day visit to Cyprus this month, the IMF cautioned that the stalemate economy, which weakened revenues and credit rating on credit rating, and banks weakened the need for emergency measures.
IMF Deputy Director for Europe Erik Jan Vrijer said the fund seems to be worried.
"The risks that the government cannot reach capital markets are very serious and the risks in the banking sector, which are in the banking sector, are more complex," said De Vrijer.
Vrijer said that Cyprus could need a bailout loan at the end of the month, the main priority must be to control problems, including extremist public spending.
The IMF cautioned that the country should not accept the demands for employment salaries and spark social aid this year, as the stagnation on economic growth predicts a 1% decline in 2012.
"The government has a time and opportunity to move forward in a decisive way to avoid the possibility of these problems," De Vrijer said.
The Greek Cypriot government, which monitors Greece 'top chapter, is now under way to reduce salaries, and now the budget for services, such as children' aid and education donations.
The government, which faces debt costs, has been translated to Russia, a country that has a four-year loan for investments in Cyprus, a country of 2.5 billion euros.
The IMF believes that the loan would be very low, as Cyprus "is" the public financing "in July, when it comes to a shelter that ended the main power station of the island and frozen the economy.
"The government has an ambitious reduction in 2012 and claims that will provide a balance budget in three years," IMF mission chief Wes McGrew said.
"To stop a fast increase in public debt, the deficit needs to reduce the deficit by 7% of GDP in 2011," McGrew said.
The government, however, has been forced to bring the Greek Cypriots to a liquidity of living with less social services, while the supervised budget target will not meet.
Some analysts, such as Andreas Theophanum of Nicosia University, say the situation is not serious, and warns the country 'Greek agriculture policy, which has led to a deeper crisis.
"Every time we have a problem of public sector spending.
We need new growth networks.
If you continue to represent economic activity measures … you have to make the internal affairs worse, "he said.
Leicester University Finance Economy Professor Panicos Demetris told SETimes that the government 'plan to reduce open deficit is convinced, but should be careful to avoid surprise.
"In recent months, the IMF has acknowledged that more austerity measures on extremism have negative impact on growth, which undermines the success of any open reduction plan," Demetris said.
"The plan of Greece has not taken full account for the growth of the excellent policy, the negative impact on state revenues and unemployment," he said.
Both analysts agree that Russia has served as a post, due to the low institutions and a number of Russian companies in Cyprus due to a double tax and taxation agreement.
"We received the reputation from the open market, more expensive," he said.
"Cyprus had to pay debt from the European Financial Stabilisation Fund, while Germany and France have been pressure from Germany and France to boost the interests of Russia and to damage the Greek Cypriot economy," Demetris said.
He also acknowledged that Russia is protecting its interests in Cyprus.
"No one can be mutually acceptable to 2.5 billion euros," he said.

The top diplomats in Bulgaria, Romania and Greece have met to boost their neighbours in the Western Balkans' aspirations for EU membership in the Western Balkans at a time when the EU faces the most serious crisis.
Bulgarian Nikolai Mladenov, Teodor Baconschi in Romania and Greece, Stavros Lambrinidis, EU foreign policy chief Javier Stefan Fatherine, sent a joint letter to EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fahes and EU Regional Policy Commissioner Johannes Hahn, "said Bulgaria" to send our common goals in the region as a common
"It is very important that the EU is not dismantled because of the other emergency problems," the ministers warned, referring to financial problems that have lived in the Eurozone crisis.
"The progress in the Western Balkans' European and Euro-Atlantic integration is a key importance to ensuring potential stability and uncertainty," he added.
The three countries have proposed a focus on three main goals -- facilitating the development of European economic projects in the region, and the development of real regional co-operation.
"Currently, it is particularly important that the region will be able to better benefit from structural funds and competencies in the new EU budget," Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vesela Chera told SETimes.
"It is important to protect the enlargement perspectives of countries in the region.
"The only way we can do so in the EU rules and criteria, including financial opportunities," Chera said. "What we are trying to do in the past a half and a half years is to try to remove small and certain obstacles in the Western Balkans to the EU."
The European Commission ranked a number of challenges to the future of the region in Europe earlier this month, in its 2011 strategy report, adopted earlier this month.

"The only possibility of achieving Stabilisation and co-operation and co-operation is to enhance new crisis in the Western Balkans.
Otherwise, any instability or disputes that will play a difficult role and pay a high price, "he said.

"Serbia will not leave the people in Kosovo and Metohija.
"If Serbian and European political circumstances want to choose one of Serbia, I will not be able to stop any of the legitimate interests of Serbia," Tadic said. "If I would ask me, I would not be able to give up the legitimacy of Serbia."

The new elected Justice and Development Party (AKP) has pledged to boost political and economic reforms that will accelerate Turkey &aposs EU bid.
"Our government seems to see the accession process as a transformation process that will improve our political, economic, social and legal standards," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday (August 31st), citing a five-year programme.
Turkish alliance with the United States, NATO membership and its final EU membership are complete elements of the same overall target, he said.
Erdogan also discussed the government &aposs policy to build closer relations with Russia and other states.
"The relationship with key players such as Eurasia, Russia, China, India and Japan should not be an alternative to Turkey &ap91; friendly relations with the United States and the EU," he said.
Erdogan was presented after four months of political tensions between the AKP government and the military on Turkey &aposs next president.
Former Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, a close member of Erdogan, took office last week.
The largest secular opposition party, Gul, boycotted the parliamentary vote on his candidacy, and the military reiterated the immunity of the army.
The AKP, which is based on political Islam, is now on the basis of key members of the provisional parties.
However, he claims that the Christian Democratic parties in Europe are a centre-right party.
Erdogan fled to a five-year programme for controversial religious issues.
Instead, it promised to boost economic development and increase human rights standards.
"Turkey is democratic, secular and social state," Erdogan said.
The constitution cannot be changed and the basic values of the Republic of the Republic, "he said.
He also pledged to prepare a new constitution "to protect the most efficient rights and bring fundamental rights and freedom in accordance with renewal standards." He added, adding that the government would seek to seek a broad consensus for the new civilian constitution.
According to media reports, the new constitution supports the ban on headscarves in universities, while exporting officers who exported Islamic links would be given to the right to clean.
The possible statements on the Sivil-military relations will further restrict the political population of the army.
A five-year programme will be discussed in parliament this week and will be presented to a confidence vote on Wednesday.

The latest round of talks on Kosovo on Thursday (August 30th) ended without significant progress towards finding a solution.
However, the two sides agreed that the province has no option.
The Kosovo Albanian delegation did not step down from the request for full independence from Serbia, while Serbian representatives have offered broad autonomy as alternative.
"We believe that we are here," Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku said in a statement to Pristina. "We should not negotiate on independence because the market cannot be a market."
However, the daily Vecernje Novosti wrote that international mediators are "great attention" by Belgrade "for autonomy.
According to the paper, the EU-Russian "troika" has made a more detailed announcement that issues such as border control and order of military forces in the province.
Belgrade and Pristina have also agreed on whether the talks should be closed and that talks are the latest round of negotiations.
The Kosovo Albanian side is not convinced that December 10th is the end of the process and that is not any other delay.
In addition, Serbian chief negotiator Sloodan Samardzic says he would not be realistic to expect the status quo until then.
Samardzic said the Western countries will soon be able to meet this history and will continue discussions.
Benzer also came from Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic.
Speaking to the daily Vecernje Novosti, Jeremic stressed that both Serbia and Russia are in the open process.
Even if Serbian prosecutors are pushing, however, Kosovo Albanians have acknowledged that Kosovo Albanians could declare independence unilateral if the existing talks are unresolved.
During a clear government meeting, Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said Serbia has achieved "to eliminate the dangers of the UN Security Council to accept a solution based on the supervised independence plan by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
However, Kostunica added, the danger of "Albanian discriminators" declared their own independence by the end of the year.
If that happens, he said, Serbia will take measures against each country that would accept Pristina 'move.
"If the Union is damaging us, you have to respond to a certain damage," he said.
"We have also offered the state and all citizens to protect us, as we protect us," he said, refusing to announce that Serbia will make such actions.
On Sunday, however, the prime ministers' Democratic Party of Serbia (DPS) suggested that Serbia could give up its efforts to join NATO.
"It is a decision that the Serbian parliament will not be able to become a NATO member," the DPS said.
Serbia is currently a member of the Alliance &aposs Partnership for Peace programme.
NATO membership has not been a precondition for EU membership, but the accession process is in the history.

BiH politicians criticise police reform
If there is no agreement on police reform, Bosnia and Herzegovina will jeopardise the chance of a key accession agreement with the Union, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned.
(AP, Reuters, AFP, DPA, RFE / RL - 31 / 08 / 07; Office of the High Representative - 30 / 08 / 07)
"The EU cannot sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina without an agreement on police reform," EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said. [Getty Images]
A new draft proposal on police reform, a key requirement for Bosnia and Herzegovina 'EU accession, has been removed in the country, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Friday (August 31st).
"This has forced Bosnia and Herzegovina to sign the chances of signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)," Rehn said in a statement. "Bosnia and Herzegovina is now the risk of its neighbours to stay and the end of the European path."
The comments came a day after leaders of the most influential Bosniak parties -- Haris Silajdzic of the Bosnia and Herzegovina (SBiH) Party (SBiH) and Sulejman Tihic of the Democratic Action Party (SDA) -- resigned a new police reform proposal.
They said the plan, proposed by High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, is not in accordance with the principles set by the EU, and that Republika Srpska (RS) has lost police structures.
"This is not a police reform, but ethnic police forces are legalised," Tihic said. "We cannot accept it."
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik, however, rejected the proposal as "unacceptable" and "constitution".
"This initiative does not support our stance on police reform and should not be a compromise solution," Reuters quoted Dodik as saying at a press conference.
In 2005, the EU made it clear that the establishment of closer relations with BiH can only be possible if the country restrucks its police in line with European standards.
The European Commission (EC) said the two constituent sides -- RS and the Federation of BiH -- have three rules to ensure the efficiency of police in the country where police have their own police forces.
The EU wants all legal and budget competencies on police to be dealt at the state level, not political intervention of police, and that police areas should be determined by professional criteria, not ethnic.
The initiatives that have passed the agreement have been blocked by the Bosnian Serb parties.
As a step towards police reform, these parties have blocked every proposal that the country would unite the two police force and reorganisation.
rejected allegations that the plan violated EU principles, Lajcak said on Thursday that Silajdzic and Tihic had made his response to a "fair and experience" proposal.
"The only entity, which will benefit the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will benefit from BiH to sign a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union," the Supreme representative said. "
Lajcak, who also serves as the EU special representative in BiH, pledged to help the country move towards EU membership in July.
Last month, Lajcak cautioned that the agreement will be signed by the end of September, but if the SAA talks are completed in December, police reform did not be reached by the end of September.
Voicing his support for Lajcak 'proposal to facilitate the agreement, Rehn insisted that it is in line with EU principles.
"I call on all political parties to continue a constructive study on Bay Lajcak and to reach a comprehensive agreement without more delays," Rehn said on Friday.

The map of geological risks in the Balkans
Southeast Europe is one of the highest in the earthquake risk, but it is not a joint approach in the region to assess geological risks so far.
This is seeking to change with a new mafia project.
By Banim Muco for Southeast European Times – 05 / 05 / 08
1: The Western Balkans' Jeological Risk Movement (Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Montenegro and Romania (BiH) sparked 1,000 papers.
The Balkan Judiciary is the region of Europe, the most complicated cantonal structure.
Sismic movements have been caused to earthquakes that cause villages in the region, causing many intellectual earthquakes.
A small team of Albanian, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Romanian experts has created a new map that shows geological risks in their countries, with the American Civil Research and Development Fund CRF.
The project is the first homojen and a committee route risk for the Balkans.
So far, such work has been used by various institutions and different methods, as independent and different methods.
However, earthquakes and other risks are not able to take national borders.
In many countries, there are problems such as extremist census, autonomy and weakness preparations.
Experts agree that a joint approach in the region is too much time.
The new project is hoping to prepare for future co-operation.
The first historical document on earthquake earthquake in the Balkans is based on the 6th century.
As a result of the earthquake in the years, many city and the village have been damaged or some have been completely diseased.
In addition, a earthquake in the region has been earthquake in 6.3 years.
Only 80 are the number of disappointed earthquakes in the past century.
How is this geological movement?
The Balkans, both the major Eurasia and Africa players, are part of a small number of smaller players, such as the Arab plates and the Adriatic magazine.
In addition, many active radical flexibility plates in the region have always created major sophistic movements.
The earthquakes are not the only threat to the region.
The shifts are very simply.
Sejelan is one of the other factors in the region, with a loss, minimum, territorial fall and territorial wage.
These findings are the risk for environmental, human life and the economy.
The creditors participate in a death in Ohrid: Arka, left (left), Mircea Radulian (Romania), Albert Avxhi (Albania), Bogdan Geleu (Romania), left), Shyseni Aliaj (left), Necore Mandorie Aliaj (Albania), Mandrim (US), Macedonia (US), Mandrim
The Jeological risks have long negative effects in the Balkans, while the recent economic and political changes in the Balkans have become more urgent to the need for sufficient measures against these risks.
Following the fall of communism, many countries in the region have entered a quick transition to democracy from the protocol regime.
The improvement of the free market economy in the region showed that the population has made a sufficient move, reinforcement of households and facilities and gathering in large cities and large cities.
If the region will be taken into account, this trend could be said to be the news of the future disasters.
To be aware of the disease of the damage that could cause the Jeological risk elements, these risks are crucial to the rise and map.
The new mafia project is an innovative study.
Mesela is recognised by the project to open access through the internet, allowing the equipment from different countries to communicate.
They also organised a murder in Ohrid, Macedonia in late March 2007 and a meeting in Tirana at the end of August of the same year.
As part of the project, the GIS technology has also been beneficial from the GIS technology to create a broad and more sensitive map.
As a result, a geological risk has revealed the latest technology product, with a society to present different database groups that can affect the country or affect a general perspective.
The decision was made by the Albanian Jewish Research Council in Tirana.
However, except of the project contributed to its contributions, the problem could be said to be the initiative to take regional issue.
In the past, organisations in the countries used different aspects of information on geological risks, defining, exercise and evaluation.
Even in the same country, it is possible to recognise that the same matter is surprised by different technical and methods.
The success of the project has been signed.
The move is planning to broadcast its work with various forums, to authorities on geological and environmental and environmental issues and to declare the consequences in the Balkans by offering them to lawmakers and politicians.
The information could help authorities use paper resources more effective.
The study on predecessor measures will be improved, but Southeast European countries -- especially in the framework of the EU enlargement process -- are blocked by administrative problems and resources among the countries in the transition process.
Three countries from the region -- Bulgaria, Greece and Romania -- joined the Union.
Others are in different stages of the accession process to change the official candidacy, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement talks.
In the pre-accession process, there are programmes that include various projects that include improving infrastructure and opportunities in the region, for member states and member states.
Serbia War Crimes War Crimes Progress
Serbian officials hope that the new law adopted would facilitate war crimes cases from the UN tribunal to Serbian courts.
However, these prospects are still at large because Belgrade does not co-operate with The Hague.

The Serbian parliament adopted a law on Thursday (December 14th) on the authority of state organs that they have a trial of war crimes indictees.
The government, which proposed the law, hopes it would encourage some cases to transfer Serbian courts.
The new law envisions two major changes in the domestic judiciary.
The evidence submitted to the ICTY allows the Serbian courts to be used by Serbian courts and enable full protection if witnesses come to Serbia.
The witnesses are also recognised for a sexual execution in Serbia.
The law allows ICTY representatives to participate in all phases of the proceedings and take the right to gain free information about the progress of the case.
Serbian Justice Minister Zoran Stojkovic said the new law would remove the main obstacles to the ICTY over the case.
According to the UN tribunal &aposs foreign strategy, the tribunal could now transfer all processes in the investigation and evidence phase to Serbia, he said.
At the same time, Stojkovic said he expects "the extradition of some cases that have been taken into place", adding that the Serbian judiciary would be able to make all international standards in line with all international standards.
Serbian officials have fought to determine what cases are particularly from the ICTY.
Justice Minister Branislav Bjelica said the first case could be transferred in early 2005.
"I cannot predict that the cases will be given us to our courts," Bjelica said, adding that the first round of a circumstances would be charged with three former Yugoslav Peoples who were indicted in Vukovar in 1991.
However, Belgrade does not co-operate with the tribunal in sufficient levels of co-operation with the tribunal.
In a report to the UN Security Council in late November, chief war crimes prosecutor Carla del Ponte criticised Serbian authorities for failing to arrest and extradite indictees that at least 12 are in the republic.
Del Ponte accused Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica "the government of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica" has shown an extraordinary attitude against the tribunal and so that it was not in the Security Council ".
Following a report by del Ponte, US Ambassador to War Crimes and Prosecutor Piery Richard Prosper said Washington is no longer supporting war crimes cases in Serbian courts, due to insufficient co-operation.
Currently, the war crimes agency in Serbia is charged with less prominent people charged with the murder of Croatian arrests near Vukovar in November 1991.
Three senior suspects in the case are Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Mile Mrksic in The Hague.
In another case, the Belgrade Regional Court sentenced to 40 years in prison for murder of Albanian civilians during the 1999 Kosovo conflict.

The top international official in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on Thursday (December 16th) ended nine Bosnian Serb officials on Thursday (December 16th) in response to the most recent war crimes fugitives in the region, even by a Bosnian Serb military asylum in June, and ordered the two sides' defence ministries in BiH to take over the next year.
The measures by High Representative Paddy Ashdown sparked NATO last week to "no" for BiH 'membership in the Alliance' Partnership for Peace programme.
Therefore, NATO has removed the country in the second time since the end of the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH, Republika Srpska (RS), the Bosnian Serb entity, has not arrested a single war crimes suspect since the end of the 1992-1995 conflict.
If NATO removed BiH in April for the same reason, he said, it would not recommend that "God" -- the right of God "against NATO in the country -- not to recommend that RS would have to stop violence.
"I can [have] to do so and everything possible," Ashdown said at a press conference in Sarajevo.
So Thursday, military reforms in BiH -- which consists of the entity army in the war under a single commander -- envisions the dismantling of defence ministries in the next three years to be slowed.
Furthermore, Ashdown said on Thursday that the ministries would be delayed by 2005 or autumn.
On Thursday, six months after Ashdown was in office for failing to arrest suspects indicted by the UN tribunal, 59 Bosnian Serb officials, former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, who had been in public opinion, and that Mladic was indicted by the RS Army (VRS) -- seven years after the tribunal indicted him for genocide.
At the same time, Mladic was revealed by neighbouring Serbia in June, when it was left from neighbouring Serbia, when it comes to the BiH border, and a six-hour resort near the eastern BiH, Han Pijesak, near the eastern BiH.
"RS authorities have pushed their own military bases and celebrate the day of Ratko Mladic and VRS," Ashdown said.
Other measures, Ashdown.
Ashdown 'actions were integrated by the EUFOR peacekeeping force on Thursday and that military facilities near Han Pijesak, one of the Han Pijesak, would close a legitimate function.
The US government announced on Thursday that the two RS political parties, including BiH Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic, have brought travel to managers of the RS political party.

Since April 30th, people who have supported the Socialist Party gathered in every day to support their "heroin".
Several dozens of lawmakers and hundreds of actions are striving in front of the office of Prime Minister Sali Berisha.
Critics claim transparency is a lack of transparency, demanding the opening of some votes in the June 2009 general elections.
Protesters say this is not only questions about the results, but also that the future elections will provide fair and transparency.
The Greeks are visited by journalists and visitors today.
However, when it comes to leaving the last stage, the crowd is gathered and the level of votes is increasing.
There are doctors in the Grev scene, and they visit them and check the situation of strikes.
Some of the health situation are worried.
Socialists' leader Edi Rama has promised strike, but did not say it will do so.
The party insists that the protest would lead Albania to democracy.
The Socialists, meanwhile, say the Socialists did not do something else from obstacles to Albania 'EU accession prospects and free trade.
Socialist lawmakers boycott parliament with the request for the restructuring of the June 2009 elections.
This stalemate, the government has made almost a stop point, and EU leaders are calling for a solution.
"This is the EU perspective of Albania," Spanish Ambassador Manuel Montobbio Balanz said earlier this year.
Last Thursday, EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele cautioned that the stalemate has threatened the chances of the country to get EU candidate status.
Berisha said he is ready to discuss Rama.
He suggested that a parliamentary commission that would investigate the issue or investigate the June elections.
According to the prime minister, the Socialists' demands to open the defendants were violated.
"In every free country, the decisions of courts can be changed, not only with other courts' decisions, but not only with other courts, or other vehicles," Berisha said.
The Socialists say that transparency rights of citizens are guaranteed with the constitution, adding that it is sufficient.
Furthermore, the idea of a parliamentary commission was revealed in March, but Berisha is rejected by the Democrats, he added.
"The photographs, or go," Berisha told Berisha.
The Socialist Movement for Integration, led by the Democratic Party and Ilir Meta, is the majority of parliament.
Meta, who served as deputy prime minister last week, urged former Socialist Party colleagues to end strike and elect the way for dialogue.
"All those who have been able to find a solution to the laws and the constitution," he said.

The four NGOs -- International Transparency Organisation, Romania, Atia Powa, Judiciary Protection Centre and the Media Protection Agency -- asked Romania on October 29th to complain a group of requests that the country would require a single parliament referendum on each other, scheduled for November 22nd.
The four organisations argue that President Traian Basescu, a constitutional right to organise a referendum, would lead to election circumstances on both the referendum and the president of the Friday elections, cautioning that other candidates would lead to the stage of movements.

This is an extraordinary, and we remember that there is no equality among the opponents in these elections, "he added.
"This is a fragile, and I think it is an incident.
We believe that this is a manipulation and election speech. "
"The referendum campaign has started.
"We can say that we have witnessed by Basescu and the number of deputies and the problem on the single truck parliament, and we can say that we have witnessed within a pre-election framework," he said.
In addition to the election posters used by Basescu in the presidential election campaign, hundreds of thousands of couples have been removed by the president, in a bid to promote a single truck assembly in the country.
Some are convincing that "the most fears will not avoid things," he said.
Basescu is calling for a unilateral parliamentary parliament, instead of 471 deputies in the two assembly.
Presidents' campaign spokesperson, Democracy Democrats -Liberal MP Sven Voiner, denied the actions of the NGO as "a move on direct political and elections", and four organisations said they lost political intellectuals with it.
Voinescu has also accused organisations of serving one of the rival of Basescu in the presidential competition.
The organisations also questioned that the number of defendants' centre-right centres in a period of repeatedly repeatedly declined to the elections.
According to NGOs, 12,000 in 1990, 15,000 defendants are the centre of 21,000 polling stations in 2004.
The latest elections in Romania, held in June, was only 27% of the European Parliament elections.

US, Russia announced new nuclear weapons agreement
If the Strategic Armed Armed Framework Agreement could cause a major reduction of the two countries' nuclear fears.

"We have a long-term visa-free vision on the path to a country that does not have a Next weapons," US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. [Getty Images]
Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev agreed on Friday (March 26th) on a historic arms balance agreement, calling for a significant decline in the two countries' nuclear fans.
"After a year of intensive negotiations with Russian counterpart, I am satisfied that the United States and Russia have announced they have reached an agreement on the most comprehensive weapons control agreement of the year," Obama said after a telephone conversation with his Russian counterpart.
The two leaders are scheduled to sign the agreement in Prague on April 8th.
The agreement will replace the 1991 Strategic Armed Forces Agreement (NGART), which ended in late 2009.
The new agreement will take effect after the US Senate and the Russian Progress approved.
When the agreement is approved, the two countries will have time to fulfil their commitments.
"With this agreement, the United States and Russia have sent a clear message that we want to be the two largest nuclear force in the world," Obama told reporters in White House.
According to the agreement, the number of long-standing nuclear wars that have been deployed as a part of each country will have to resist 1550, which is currently a low increase from 2200% to 30%.
This is the first time of the NGART agreement, and one of the 600,000 wars rating of the issue is more than a quarter.
Both countries should also be removed and have to restore the number of heavy bombings with nuclear weapons to 800.
This figure is lower than 1600 in the 1991 agreement.
The two countries also agreed to limit the number of fiscal missile missile missing from the balance and limit.
"These steps that we are convinced are very clear," US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said.
Obama said the new NGART agreement has created a strong mechanism for control and monitoring, while the country will also protect national security and protect its commitments to maintain national security and allies.
The agreement will help the two countries to "leave the day of the Cold War", the US chief said.
"As the United States and Russia co-operate in an effective way, the two secularism and progress in security and prosperity in the world," Obama said.
Russia, however, still warns that the United States could withdraw from the agreement if Moscow plans to form a missile defence system in Eastern Europe, as it opposes Moscow.
"The agreement was signed at a time when both sides have strategic attacks and defence systems," the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Wall Street Journal quoted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying. "Any changes in these levels have the right to continue to reduce strategic weapons in both sides."
Meanwhile, an agreement signed Friday was signed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, NATO Secretary-General Anders Focus Rasmussen and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.
In a statement, Ban expressed hope that the agreement would "ratify without delay before it can be implemented".

By Drazen Remikovic for Southeast European Times in Banja Luka -- 22 / 03 / 12
"When the final decision on joining NATO is time, we must give the chance to say what people think about a referendum," RS President Milorad Dodik said. [Reuters]
Republika Srpska (RS) President Milorad Dodik made the possibility of a referendum in the entity last week -- this time NATO membership.
Some say this is a market for the October elections in BiH, but the majority of RS citizens are a real trust on the Alliance.
"Serbs have been very negative experience with NATO, but we must give the opportunity to say what it is a final decision on establishing good relations with the Alliance, when it comes to NATO membership," Dodik said on March 14th, referring to the Sarajevo TV1 television.
The opposition parties in RS have supported the referendum on the entity, while parties from the Federation of BiH stressed that the issue is a state level.
Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) lawmaker Aleksanra Pandurec said the vote should be done in line with a controversial law adopted by RS in 2010.
"We believe that the decision on whether to participate in a military alliance such as NATO should not participate in a military alliance, and that the people should be able to give the public, as in all democratic and developed countries.
Our position is that BiH is a military basis, "he said.
Most of the public opposition is from the NATO operation, which was held in September 1995 and the RS Army attacked defence systems.
The move was organised as a monitoring of RS forces attacking the Markale market star in Sarajevo, causing the death of 68 people.
At the same time, Mart-June 1999, NATO organised a military action against the former Yugoslavia, following President Slobodan Milosevic rejected the Ramboud Treaty Treaty, which ended the war in Kosovo.
Social Democratic Party (SDP) Vice President Slobodan Popovic believes NATO membership is a state issue.
"We do everything to accept the Alliance is our strategic interest.
"I believe the referendum is used to be used in accordance with the daily political purposes, because the referendum in RS was announced earlier, but there was no time," he said.
BiH adopted the Action Plan for NATO membership (MAP) in April 2009, but it was essential because the country is still resolving its military property.
International Relations Centre for International Relations in Banja Luka, an NGO with political forecasts, Milos Solaja, said RS 'stance towards NATO is forming the main political forces in the country, with the official position of Serbia, which does not trust the Alliance.
"If the referendum is held today, there is no support for NATO in RS.
However, I think that BiH will take years in front of the door of NATO.
So far, many things could be changed, "he said.
A survey conducted by the Banja Luka-based market "Comunicians in November 2011 is considered a lack of pressure on the RS people.
NATO membership is supported by only 26% of the population, while 55% oppose membership in the Alliance.
About 19% are undetermined.
In other news, citizens of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported the idea of BiH to join NATO by 81%, while only 12% oppose membership in the Alliance.
Given the overall score, 59.7% of the BiH population supports NATO membership, while citizens oppose the idea.
One of the ten participants -- or 11.1% -- is still undetermined.
Bojan Vlaski, 27, a lawyer from Banja Luka, said NATO has organised two times against Serbs, so BiH should not be a member.
"I support the referendum initiative and I am convinced that the people of RS will vote against NATO.
The RS will be completely complicated to the support of a military alliance that killed humanitarian people and civilians, "he said.
Pristina backs Serbia to prevent elections in Kosovo
The May 6th elections in Serbia and the same elections are the problem of regular plans in northern Kosovo.
By Muhamet Brajshori for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 22 / 03 / 12
Belgrade said he would include the presidential, municipal and parliamentary elections in Serbia, including election areas in northern Kosovo.
Kosovo Serbs gathered in Mitrovica. [Reuters]
Serbian plans to include territorial territory in Kosovo on May 6th, a power demonstration and cause improvements between the two countries.
However, some analysts think Pristina must allow the elections.
Representatives of four municipalities in the north of Kosovo said on Wednesday (March 21st) that Serbia wants to hold local elections in Kosovo on May 6th.
According to local media reports, the representatives of the Kosovo Serbs rejected Pristina institutions in a recent referendum that does not convince Kosovo Serbs' commitment to Serbia.
Kosovo Interior Minister Bajram Rexhepi said police are preparing a operation plan to prevent Serbia &aposs vote and will be co-ordinated with EULEX and KFOR.
"Serbia claims it will hold the elections, but we should not be ready to respond to the election day, but we should not be ready to respond to Kosovo, and Kosovo must use all democracy vehicles," Rexhepi told Kosovo Radio Television.
The peacekeeping force will not be able to do so, he said, if Serbian groups are trying to hold election meetings.
Serbia says the election arrangement in Kosovo, which declared independence four years ago, is a constitutional obligation.
Kosovo is recognised by more than 80 countries.
Gerard Gallucci, a member of the UN Regional Administration for Mitrovica and the Transparency Council in Mitrovica, told SETimes that the elections in Kosovo should be organised by Pristina.
"Pristina cannot be closed on these elections, and Kosovo will be more active for everyone.
The media denied them 'rule and importance, while the withdrawal can withdraw and diplomatic behaviour, "he said.
The elections could be blocked in southern Kosovo, but this will not be done in northern Kosovo, Gallucci said.
A successful initiative to stop the elections will further deepen divisions and understand that Pristina has no real influence in the north.
"The use of power in South Kosovo will not be successful to stop the elections.
However, it could also cause incidents, which will make Kosovo a European outlook.
In the north of the Ibar River, the use of power is likely to be restored.
Another crisis that would lead to the resistance of local Kosovo Serbs could be jeopardised, "he said.
The international community is likely to help Pristina to prevent elections in the north, Gallucci said.
Kosovo Directorate and Public Policy President Arjeta Riri told SETimes that the international community is responsible for helping Pristina.
"The international community that guarantees Pristina that the Serbian elections will not be held, and Kosovo police should not be supported if a decision to use police," he said.
Pristina is limited to prevent the elections in northern Kosovo, he said.
"The barricades in the north and the current situation will be force to prevent the elections.
This could only KFOR, "he said.
International Civilian Ofis spokesperson Christian Palace told SETimes that the law supports Serbia 'parliamentary elections in Kosovo, but it could only organise Pristina' election.
"Serbian citizens of Kosovo -- in Kosovo -- warning the practices in Europe -- have the right to vote for the parliamentary elections in Serbia," he said, as the Kosovo Assembly is determined on the Serbian elections.
"In the local elections, the cheaper legitimate local elections in Kosovo are being organised by the Kosovo government.
The International Administration Group called for Serbia in January to ensure that the local elections will not be able to Kosovo, "he said.
The Contact Group expects a solution to Kosovo 'status in 2006, and Annan is worried about delays
Kosovo expects a solution to the status issue by the end of 2006, the Contact Group said on Tuesday, stressing that any solution should support a ethnic society in the province and be accepted by the public.
(FT - 01 / 02 / 06; AP, Reuters, Beta, Xinhua, British Foreign Affairs, UN News Centre - 31 / 01 / 06)
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Kosovo has "worried about delays and terrorism in many areas". [AFP]
The Contact Group on the future of Kosovo urged Belgrade and Pristina on Tuesday (January 31st) to work constructive to find a solution to the province ’ s status issue by the end of this year.
The foreign ministers of the six-nation group, including the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Russia, said in a joint statement after the meeting in London, "all efforts should be made possible to reach a compromise solution in 2006".
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, attended the meeting, and UNMIK chief Soren Jessen-Petersen.
They called on Belgrade and Pristina to enter closer co-operation with Ahtisaari in resolving many challenges awaiting for interest.
These issues include freedom of movement, relations between the local communities in Serbia and Kosovo, and protection of religious communities and mechanisms.
The local administration is expected to be another critical issue.
The direct talks between Serbian and Kosovo Albanian authorities must begin on January 25th, but the talks were delayed after Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova died four days ago.
Now the talks are expected to begin in late February.
In November, the Contact Group issued a series of raids that would be monitored in a solution to the status issue, as well as other materials, not returned to the pre-1999 situation, Kosovo 'division and unification of any other country.
Another solution should be accepted by the Kosovo people, the Contact Group said, noting that Belgrade "has reminded the policies of the current problems in the past".
The international community is ready to "support Serbian democratic forces in use the opportunity to bring Serbia to them," the statement said.
However, the document called on Belgrade authorities to fulfil their "constant commitments" to co-operate fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.
Kosovo Albanian leaders need to difference that a multiethnic solution is the only option that can be able to live, the ministers said, warning that those who are thought to use violence to achieve their goals would "get their own components".
Annan, meanwhile, expressed concern that Kosovo is slow in meeting the international community standards set by the UN Security Council, in its latest six-month report to the UN Security Council.
Annan urged the province leaders to renew their efforts to achieve targets.
Another issue of the UN chief is the increase in serious security cases, including the incidents that were targeted for the ethnic reasons of Kosovo Serbs last year "between December and December.
Annan stressed that the province leaders and institutions "must work closely with UNMIK to ensure that those responsible for justice" should be brought to justice.
Election results have a challenge to Kurdish reform
In the local elections, voters in the southeastern part of the AKP, not the AKP, but also a more radical concept of the Democratic Society Party, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has affected the reform policy.
By Ayhan Simsek for Southeast European Times -- 20 / 04 / 09

The local elections in Turkey on March 29th showed the chance of a solution to the Kurdish problems.
The Democratic Society Party of Democratic Society (DTP), believed to be linked to the terrorist PKK, won almost all of the main municipalities in the southeast of the Kurdish population.
This outcome was a major blow for the Justice and Development Party (AKP), which is trying to win the support of Kurds for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and moderate reform policies.
The DTP, which won the municipalities in Diyarbakir, as well as the municipalities in seven cities and 50 municipalities in Southeast Europe, has won four urban and 18 more than in the 2004 local elections.
Erdogan &aposs party hopes that Turkey won 100 municipalities in eastern and southeastern Turkey, giving the prime minister more powerful authority for reform programme and to weaken the PKK.
The AKP, who fought all its power for the post, opened the first Kurdish television station in the country through the public broadcaster TRT.
The state officials have sparked the public and a crowd.
Erdogan visited key cities in the region and promised to provide more investment, more employment and better social services for them.
This initiative has not been very serious criticism from the Turkish opposition. The party, who lives 15 per cent of the vote compared to 2007, has only four municipalities.
The AKP has accused the PKK for the outcome.
"The Terrorism organisation is not possible to organise a successful election campaign in areas where the PKK threatened voters and party officials," Egemen Bager, the Turkish EU Chairman, told reporters.
According to Milliyet daily Milliyet, the results are "a strong warning".
In the newspaper, the DTP has sparked the unidentified politics and radical approach and the consequences of Kurds' feelings under pressure, the outcome said, adding that the outcome has to make a solution to the Kurdish issue in the near future.
"This is a warning of the AKP against nationalist, authority and the only party," DTP leader Ahmet Turkey said. [Getty Images]
The DTP leader Ahmet Turkey described the success as a victory of democracy and called for the AKP to change its approach.
"This is a warning of the AKP against nationalist, authority and the only party to power.
This is a warning for the AKP, in which the new constitution is sparked by EU reforms, in which democracy is only a limited democracy, "he said.
The DTP, -- including the adoption of a new constitution that promotes autonomy to Kurds -- wants radical changes in the Turkish state system and to be overcome for PKK militants.
Although the last election consequences are more safe, many analysts think the party will not be able to achieve a valuable concession from the AKP in the short term.
Erdogan has so far failed to appoint any DTP members or meet with them.
Moreover, the party has criticised the PKK as a terrorist organisation and has not condemned the attacks by the PKK.
Sedat Bozirt, a senior journalist and Fox TV office in Ankara, says Erdogan &ap91; party] has dropped from a political stage that was founded by the DTP.
"The DTP leaders were more violence and radical rhetoric to undermine the support of the Kurds' AKP.
The Radical demands have been made and these demands were rejected by Prime Minister Erdogan and AKP leaders.
This is the result of the type of critical, and Kurdish voters have been united under the DTP, "he said.
If the AKP wants to regain the security and votes of Kurds, it has to meet them 'demands for identification, according to Bozrut.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has promised a new opening for the southeastern province. [Getty Images]
Erdogan has made a new opening statement for the southeastern province for a long time. In 2005, he promised to recognise the Kurdish reality "and even a new citizenship was revealed.
However, the restructuring of violence by the PKK in recent months has sparked the country, and a serious political pressure from nationalism.
PKK terrorists have been using the mountains of Iraq for years in attacks targeting Turkey.
The unrest of this cancer has spent almost 40,000 people since 1984.
The DTP leaders still seem more than the idea of condemning the terrorism organisation, and the Turkish government is still unable to find a peaceful solution, but not to the PKK.
All observers now have been transferred to the International Kurdish Conference, scheduled to be held in Erbil, northern Iraq in early May.
The DTP plans to meet Kurdish groups and representatives of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran, as well as PKK representatives.
Local media reports that the PKK could announce the conditions for removing weapons at this meeting.
However, the Mediterranean believes the PKK terrorism will end, nor how a solution could be resolved in the short term.
"It is the social integration policies of our democratic reform policies and unity, which reflects the Kurdish identity of our Kurdish identity in the long-term term.
However, to achieve this target, the opposition parties are committed to opening a opening opening for the future of Turkey, including the CHP and the MHP, "he said.
Another factor that makes the situation more complicated, the ruling party and the army, which is protected by the secular state.
In a conflict with Erdogan and his party, Erdogan and his party have a "Islamic", while the military called for a simple presence on Kurdish issues.
Turkish top commander said this week that Turkish citizens are based on the basis of Turkish citizenship, cultural rights supported the enlargement of cultural rights.
Chief of General Staff General Ilker Basbug said on Tuesday that the Kurdish youth were closed to the PKK 'career, due to problems such as unemployment and opportunity, and the fight against terrorism is "a comprehensive strategy" and huge legal changes.
Meanwhile, Basbug, who opposes the idea of recognition of a new constitution and the Kurdish identity, said Turkey is not a state based on ethnicity.
"Turk is a general identity (high-level identification), which has all Turkish citizens who have equal rights," he said.
BiH Calls for Affairs Affairs Assistance
Hundreds of thousands of people in BiH are helping to prepare their rights.

The photography, founded by women from the two eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Zepa Annan organisations in 1995, covering the assets of the Sarajevo office of the Sarajevo and Zepa Annan, is being seen in international officials and intellectual operations.
However, there are no photographs that are all the most important in the document, with the 16 family and the government, which shows the projects of helping people to prepare the law.
Among other provisions, the bill acknowledged the right to know that these people are doing the losses, allowing them to compensate them.
Fikir was discovered by foreign organisations, not by foreign organisations.
"The problem of these governments is not us.
"It is a part of the children of the Bosniak, Bosniak or Croat, killing or eliminated," he said.
Subasic added that the bill should be removed from civilians and losses from each other.
The law is also crucial to the Federation Commission and the Republika Srpska (RS) Agency for Reconstruction and the Republika Srpska (RS) Agency, which has already been under the state level, not only the families' logical activities.
Such a contract means that the capture of missing persons will no longer be ethnic.
In addition, BiH has allowed to solve the problem of the missing persons who didn ’ t live in their own. The wars between the 1992-1995 conflict are estimated that around 30,000 people are losing.
Klaudia Kuljuh, a state official at the International Charter Commission (ICMP), who has the largest DNA facility in the world, says the controversial controversial changes could be possible in recent years, even if the controversial agreement can be reached.
"I have been in this job since 1997 and we have been on the south of the difference between 1997 and 2003," Kuljuh said.
The first time has been convicted, the ICMP official said.
As the Federation group wants to open a license in RS, the RS agency has acknowledged it for allowing them to open bars in the Federation.
Kuljuh said the entities are now helping the commissions more than hundreds of hundreds of thousands of transformations each year, the budget is sworn eight years ago.
In addition, people have demanded military fear during their work in other entity, as they are seeking to open.
"The [NATO] peacekeeping force] did not limit the inter-entity border without SFOR, but now," he said.
Everything, BiH is the first post-war country that has passed a law on a missile persons.
ICMP Permanent Chairman Gordon Bacon said the law could create a model in countries such as Iraq, such as Iraq, where more than 300,000 people have disappeared during the power of the 24-year Sadain Hussein.
Bacon is optimistic that the law will be ready to discuss the parliament soon, as the BiH Ministry of Human Rights and Relations focused on the issue.
"The signals from the government are not encouraging the job," Bacon said. "I am encouraging that the government will do it," he said. "

The sale of Bulgaria, which has been stopped for the laws and stopped by a stopped Bulgarian tobacco monopoly, could be able to warn foreign investors by blocking the government 'privatisation targets in Sofia.
By Alina Michailova for Balkan Times in Sofia - 02 / 12 / 02
The pro-reform government is rising the possibility of achieving the privatisation targets of the pro-government, while foreign investors also send a negative signal to foreign investors.
If Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg has failed to success this year, the government has reached an agreement on economic reforms and credit agreements with the IMF and the World Bank.
The sale process, which began in March, is crucial in society.
A major part of the Turkish separate minority living in poverty -- about 8 per cent of the population of Bulgaria -- allows them to sell their products by selling the Belgartabak.
This is the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which is created by the smaller partners, says the coalition wants to reinforce a profit consequence of the sale.
The two major opposition parties -- the Democratic League of Socialists and the Socialists of the Socialists in London -- have already been appointed in politics, while Deputy Prime Minister Nikolay Vassilev, who is currently holding the government 'economic team.
Three bidders have been offered to buy the bureau.
The Privatisation Administration has chosen a bidder for the consortium, which was created by the registered Tobacco Capital Orders in Sofia in August, and the Netherlands First Cernis Innis.
The consortium supported by the German Deutsche Bank has proposed 110m euros for a 80 per cent stake in the company.
Other three candidates -- Russian Consortium for Metatabak Consortium, Tobacco Holding of Vienna and the Russian Consortium to sell the Rosgartable Studies process, claiming that the Supreme Court has allowed them to recognise the final offer.
The Supreme Court has finalised the application and has agreed that new bidders should be able to achieve better financial consequences, according to the values of the sale of the Privatisation Administration.
The decision to sell the consortium supported by Deutsche Bank has also been declared legally.
The Privatisation Administration said the sale process is fair, insisting that there is no wrong.
In the latest term of the fight against the law, the Privatisation Administration has applied to the Supreme Court, which would result in the decision.
The council will ask the Supreme Court to approve the verdict, or to allow the consortium, which has chosen the decision, to be represented by the consortium and selling talks.
It could also require a new sale tender.
The Supreme Court of Supreme Court said on Friday (November 29th) that the decision will be made by the end of December.
If the revenue process is more delayed, the government will not be possible to reach the privatisation target of 300m US troops in 2002.
Government officials say the state budget will not be affected, because the country is sufficient in financial reserves.
However, Prime Minister Saxe-Coburg cautioned that problems with the sale of the sale could harm the Bulgarian investment image.

Montenegrin initiatives to reform the education system by participating in the pro-European Bolona Process have also been sparked to problems, according to the main figures of the country.
"The main principles of the Bologna Process, but only if the current conditions are implemented, it will create a French nature," Milan Popovic, a political science professor at the University of Montenegro, told Southeast European Times.
"They are the three priority of the Bolona Process: transition (license / license), quality safety and education," the European Commission website said. "
"Bologna must be implemented in realistic conditions.
We have no consequences and we do not have enough, "he said.
"It is normal to have 30 students per cent of a teacher.
This figure is up to 50, and I can even remove 100 students.
However, a professor of professionals is simply difficult.
This education is a crime against, "he said.
Dragan Koprivica, a professor at the Felfe Foundation in Niksic, acknowledges that a professional "is very difficult to create 300,000 or 500 students".
"It is easy for students," Koprivica said. "There are two or four explosives instead of exploitation.
In addition, students need to be classified during the year, which could be almost impossible for a professional professional. "
Montenegro has been a member of the Bolona Process since 2003.
Following the breakup to Bologna in Montenegro, students were only a test of textbooks in the year, and this would be generally achieved.
The school was another test during the year.
Bologna has changed this situation, and some students do not have to enter the finals.
"I think this is a good thing for a students' school, and if they 'the final test of the deepest," Koprivica said.
Popovic acknowledged that a student should be able to gain a score for the year, but believes that some universities are not the most prominent finance.
"The students who are in the factor of political scientific scientific will have to speak in the future colleagues.
"It is wrong to tell them to tell them and not give a rating from the so-called test," he said.
Milena Miskovic, a new dynamic from the University of Montenegro International Relations, also agrees.
"I am beyond the idea.
For the year, we had a chance to work for our rating.
It has caused an increase of the discrimination rating. "
Nemanja Djuraskovic, a student at the University of Montenegro, is not completely in the same idea, "said Montenegrin University of Economic programme student Nemanja Djuraskovic. [Bolona] I have to work for every day, so many times.
It may be a good thing, because I don &ap91; I don] do not have any rest. "
Order Reform in Croatia
The Croatian government has announced decisive measures to launch the reform process that will be implemented in the country.
By Miranda Novak for Southeast European Times in Zagreb - 14 / 04 / 04
Following a recent deadline on the Croatian armed forces, the NATO delegation urged Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to complete the four armed forces and to take decisive measures, including reducing the number of current weeks.
With these and other measures, the government is hoping to speed up the reform process, which is implementing NATO standards.
The number of armed forces and the defence ministry employees of the planned armed forces is a fast decline from 40,000 to 19,500 in 2006.
The airline envisions a single command unit, instead of the three military commanders, including the card forces and equipment, a single commander.
In addition, authorities have responded to the decision to establish a special commander operation unit that will be prepared to prepare Croatian troops to peacekeeping missions.
Croatian officials have said that the air force has been transformed, and that the final deadline is considered.
The defence ministry veto the idea of purchasing a new airline and the modernisation of existing aircraft flights.
The car and transportation helicopters have become the priority of air forces.
These are both military purposes and effective for peacekeeping operations.
So far, military analysts say the bureaucracy has slowed the military reform process.
The key figures in charge of the transformation of the Croatian Army, which was established on the details of the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army, have been charged with insufficient efforts.
The NATO alliance delegation concluded that several army and commander units that the country has the army, have been a model for approach.
Prosecutors said that the biggest challenge awaiting Croatia is to overcome the territorial defence arbitration of its territorial defence.
Following this change, Croatia will face an important obstacle on its path to full NATO membership.
Visegrad Group support for Western Balkan countries' EU integration
"The Visegrad Group is ready to support the integration of the Western Balkan countries," the foreign ministers said in a statement.
(MTI - 07 / 10 / 09; AFP, Budapest Times, MTI, TASR, The Slovak SR, MRT, Hungarian Foreign Ministry - 06 / 10 / 09)
[V4]
The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and and Slovakia, known as the Visegrad Group, expressed support for the Western Balkan countries' Euro-Atlantic integration during a meeting in Budapest on Tuesday (October 6th).
"Euro-Atlantic integration plays an important role in the transformation of Central Europe," the ministers said in a joint statement after the talks, adding that "enlargement policy wants to improve stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans".
The Czech Republic, known as the Visegrad Foundation (V4), joined the EU in 2004, along with Hungary, Poland and and other six Eastern European countries, and all NATO members.
Hungary, which currently holds V4, will take over the six-month rotating EU presidency from Belgium on January 1st 2011, and will transfer to Poland on July 1st of the same year.
The six-month bloc chairmanship of the six-month bloc will be transferred to Sweden to Spain on January 1st 2010.
"The Visegrad Group is ready to support the integration of the Western Balkan countries during the next presidency of the EU and to assess membership applications," the foreign ministers said in a statement.
But the ministers stressed, however, that the candidate countries are in their own hands, and that it depends on efforts to implement reforms needed for EU membership.
"It was a good shift in implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and a positive assessment process is accelerating the accession process," the ministers said.
While the Western Balkan countries are evaluating their official applications for EU membership, the group added, they should not be able to comply with it.
Four former communist countries' top diplomats also pledged to help EU candidates prepare for eventual membership in the bloc.
"The Visegrad countries will also present the preparation and recent experts in the preparation and implementation of the integration strategy, including effectively affecting the pre-accession funds by the EU," the statement said.
The Western Balkan countries -- Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia -- are all in different phases of the accession process.
Croatia, which is among them, is expected to join the EU in 2011.
The V4 foreign ministers believe this would "encourage more encouraging the integration process and to make the candidate country reforms."
Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia will take a step closer to the EU within a few months, when their citizens can travel to the bloc, as of January 1st.
"It is an attorney that efforts to fulfil the requirements have made concrete results," the foreign ministers said.
Following that Serbia has increased co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, V4 said the EU has expressed support for the implementation of an interim trade agreement between Belgrade and Belgrade.
They also called on all political parties in BiH to work together to fulfil the conditions for the transformation of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) to the EU Special Representative (EUSR).
"The V4 countries also recommend that EUFOR supports the presence of BiH and continues to continue its current mandate until the ITD-EUSR is completed," the statement said. "These reaffirmed the importance of the constitutional reform and reaffirmed that Bosnia and Herzegovina has the EU perspective."
The V4 foreign ministers agreed on Tuesday with their counterparts from Albania, BiH, BiH, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.
Cyprus Church deeps EU Enlargement, Turkey &aposs Membership
Following a meeting of the UN unilateral zone in Nicosia on February 28th, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash (right) sparked new Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, while the current mandate is closing, President Glafos Klerides are following the final talks on Cyprus and the EU accession. [AFP]
By Robert Herschbach for Southeast European Times - 24 / 03 / 03
The removal of the Cyprus peace process earlier this month was interpreted by a broad broadcaster of the divided island as an unprecedented opportunity for the future of the divided island.
The Greek side will sign a contract to the EU in April and has met the best conditions that Turkey can be able to join the EU.
Turkish Cypriots are seen during a demonstration in Nicosia on February 27th, during a demonstration in the Turkish side of Nicosia. [AFP] Turkish Cypriots have been dismissed from the international community to enter the EU in the southern province. In 1989, they are willing to demonstrate that they want to join the EU.
Following 40,000 soldiers in the north of the island, Turkey had the necessary to ask a solution on the island.
The military presence on the island will seek the doors of a very difficult crisis, when the Greek side entered the EU.
In January, the leader of the ruling Justice and Development Party in Turkey, and neighbouring Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had asked his country to call for a frequent change in Cyprus, calling for talks.
Glafkos Klarides, whose leader of the Greek Cypriots, hoped to open his career with a unification agreement.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has reached an agreement on the question that Annan has made efforts to resolve the long time, would mean an an important success for UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
However, the obstacles that have not been able to reach a solution for years have been seen as much as easier.
Following February 28th, the UN took place in the latest consensus set by March 10th, and Klerides were not restored and Tassos Papadopoulos was instead.
Following the disappointment, Annan said his special envoy, Altero De Soto, would replace his star and leave the region.
Although the only person who won victory in the long term could be said to be Denktash, who is acting the final solution.
Denktash said that a "vote" was the victory of Turkish Cypriots in a bid to avoid themselves.
The planned plan, drafted by Annan, was a model in Switzerland.
According to that, the establishment of two sovereignty states from a joint federal state and two unilateral Parliament will be formed. The House of the High Representative will be represented by both states, and the president will be based on the transformation of the president.
It was one of the basic disputes, along with the restoration of Rums, which was removed from the military force in 1974.
On March 30th, the ongoing referendum on both sides of the island urged UN Secretary-General leaders to meet in The Hague as a dramatically dramatic effort to sign a EU membership agreement on 16 April.
The new elected Greek Cypriot leader Papadopoulos acknowledged some withdrawals, but Denktash rejected the invitation.
Following the end of the road for production, Annan said he was "deeply regret".
"I am not confident that there will be no similar opportunity at a time," Annan said, noting that the Greek Cypriots' chance to decide on their own future ".
US Undersecretary of State Richard Boucher announced statements that Annan supports his statements.
"We are very beautiful that Denktash has the right to determine Turkish Cypriots' own future opportunities and the right to vote on a complex issue," Boucher said.
The first effect of the unexpected development, the Greek Cypriots will be able to sign a accession agreement with the EU, as the European Commission (EC) spokesperson Jean-Christophe Palori said, "we can be signed by the EU, as long as the plan is planned, and that the EU agreement will be signed by Cyprus".
Speaking to the island of EU Enlargement Commissioner Guenter Verheugen, Palori also warned Turkey that "the assessment of how to affect EU membership prospects" could be affected ", warning that the division of the island will be able to start accession talks if the divided status of Turkey".
"If there is no agreement on Cyprus by the end of 2004, there will be a minimum situation, such as the failure to recognise one of our member states that have been closed for membership," he said.
Although the Turkish Cypriots entered the EU, a problem will be a more flexible.
The Turkish Cypriots, who will decrease them, "voted with their actions", could not continue to change the foundation of the north 'north' census.
As the local people are leaving the island, the "Turkishness" programme, it could continue to keep the rebels from the poor areas of Anatolian.
Turkey has said that the island could be in a clear way, and it could mean that Turkey has the chance to join the EU is almost completely end.
However, Turkish leaders can decide on this direction if they do not think their chances for membership.
Some are approaching Annan [AFP] with a Turkish Cypriot agreement, but Denktash, a popular leader in Turkey, who has the support of the effective army.
Furthermore, Turkish Cypriots, who are the most effective in the island, could be resisting their property to disagree with a reunification agreement.
Greek Cypriots also discovered doubts about the Annan plan -- the doubts have been found in the elections that Klerides' restructuring, and the number of refugees to return will bring their property claims.
The latest draft draft of the amendment is to limit borders as a member of the Turkish Cypriot state.
Cyprus, which is neighbouring Turkey, the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, has been a major trade centre since the former aircraft.
Ottoman Turkish Cypriots have sovereignty from the Venice and sovereignty on the island, from the Wenice, in 1973. In Britanin, Britanin continues to address the experience of the island.
Cyprus was an independent republic in 1959.
Switnesses and ethnic clashes have left the island as a vulnerable for Turkish and Greek communities, causing the establishment of an interim Turkish administration.
Discussions between the two communities have been under way for years of talks between Klerides and the Turkish entity, clearing the Turkish side.
While the Turkish Cypriots demanded a federation of two parts of these talks, Greek Cypriots opposed this request and the talks ended without any outcome.
In 1974, officers from Greece were created a military military force, and the Turkish Cypriot National Guard (Rumca) wrapped up to 37 per cent of its territory, removing the name into the island "unity" (Rumca).
The talks on the UN monitoring began in 1976, and has been under way since then.
Nevertheless, the EU 'Copenhagen summit in 2002 has been a lawyer, which has been helping the Greek Cypriot entity to discuss possible developments in talks with the Greek Cypriot side.

Albanian new investment strategy
At the same time, discrimination in the Balkans are beginning to focus on the list of countries in the region: more foreign direct investment will be made.
The Albanian government, led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha, is implemented by innovative methods.
By Robert C. Austin for Southeast European Times – 02 / 09 / 06
Following the signing of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Albania in June 2006, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha (left) and Austrian Foreign Minister Ura Plassnik presented each other. [Getty Images]
Today, the most popular issue in the Balkans is the fight for foreign direct investments in all countries in the region, and improving these investments.
Southeast European countries seek innovative ways to boost foreign direct investments.
Meanwhile, the political stability -- one of the most important preconditions for investing in the coming months -- is expected to increase in the political stability.
Recently, the independence referendum in Montenegro was an extraordinary news agency for the future.
Despite the concern and uncertainty, the referendum was disappointed.
Independent votes have feared the 55% threshold of the 55% threshold, but it is not a fears.
Therefore, the EU and other observers have also received an explosives and returned to their homes as satisfied with the outcome.
The latest electoral campaign in the country has been simply caused.
Politicians were forced to think that the independence issue is more basic issues.
Following the tensions, I am very satisfied.
Serbia still depends on the capture of Ratko Mladic, but the rest of the region is ready to take an extraordinary way.
The Democratic Party of Albania, led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha, is willing to start a fight between the countries that want to attract foreign investments soon, and things Albania must do to lose this fight.
The most extremely surprised to visit Albania is that there is no more foreign brand in the country.
In the capital, the country has made significant jobs, in particular, when citizens working abroad are sent, but the key sectors of key importance need more.
Tirana and Durres are growing with a highway connecting the two cities.
However, there is no stability in investments, and Albania is not only in Tirana.
The poverty needs investments in foreign sectors.
The most important reason for foreign investments is that Albania has won the international arena (impossible).
Those who arrive in Albania have returned to their countries as a more positive impression.
However, it must be much more to show that the country has made serious progress in foreigners.
In addition, international investors operating in the country could begin, citing the beginning.
A growth of 5-6 levels is a simple number.
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU shows that Albania is on the right path.
Although political life is still a simple environment, the risks are no longer great.
The Democrats also published their own newspaper newspapers, such as the Socialists and other smaller parties.
Those newspapers hope, but it is not a problem.
The fight between Socialist party leader Edi Rama and Berisha is under way, and former Socialist leader Fatos Nano has already offered to form his own party in a party, and now citizens in the street are now aware of such politics.
In the other hand, the two major parties have reached an agreement on electoral rules to implement the upcoming local elections, which also envisions the ruling chances to boycott the parliament.
Albania does not benefit from its tourism potential. [Getty Images]
There is a great team of Berisha, who took steps on this issue.
Young and energy Public Services, Transport and Telecommunications Minister Lulzim Basha, are able to make it clear.
The mafia in the office of Basha shows how Albania will improve its transport network, which will be easily easier to go in a country, and will increase its strategic port.
Montenegro is widely clear to international investments, but Albania is on the grounds of tourism investments.
The highway, which will begin from Dubrovnik and reveal the coastal coast in the southern city of Saranda, will change the country.
This project is critical for Albania to benefit its from its long-standing coastal tourism potential.
The service sector, particularly restaurant and hotels in Albania, is offering extraordinary restaurants to those who are doing the country.
We have returned to the citizens of the country and abroad.
The country will not be affected by those who visit tourists and visit it.
Albania is also a rich country in terms of natural resources, such as oil, natural gas, poor and hydropower potential.
The most important step has been Berisha "Albania" programme so far.
Although the plan has not been complete, it is to offer investors who are interested in the fields of strategic importance, such as minimum, agriculture, imports and energy, as well as the need for major investors.
As part of the Plan, the ministerial ministries will determine their assets and then get them a long-term term for a year.
Furthermore, if the state has a long-term development strategy, you can be able to repair a year of stock.
Meanwhile, many important details are expected to be resolved, as the offer will be elected and how it will be implemented if the investment commitments are not met.
The plan will be granted to the economy minister Young Ruli, which is the basis for implementing the plan, and Ruli is not a huge one of the job.
Although the plan is a very innovative idea, it is very serious risks: the political consequences that will be easy if the assets do not meet the expectations of investors.
The government is preparing to submit fixed tax and gas incidents to attract foreign investors.
Following the day of a rural trade scandal in the country, there are no longer been reduced to eight years.
Prime Minister Sali Berisha has promised that this will be further reduced.
Among other measures that have created a reduction of the state, tax evasion and austerity from general spending, the government was particularly satisfied.
The citizens in the public now have a chance to declare corruption, which is much less bribery cases.
This is a very positive development for foreigners.
The main ministers of Albania have already underlined developments in their countries, citing at conference abroad.
I am positive that Albanian ministers have created foreign investors.
Berisha, meanwhile, worked to consult on issues such as former US Security Minister Tom Ridge, security issues such as organised crime and corruption, as well as NATO partnership and investment.
The country is being implemented in policy.

More than two-thirds of Bulgarian people are rising damage from hospital or hospitalism, according to a survey on the Eurobarometer security in April.
According to Anna-Maria Borissova, the new health minister of the country, the lack of poor governance and professionalism is damaging the health system.
"I want the country to ensure the high quality health service," Borissova said after his appointment on April 22nd. "The best possible invitation in every hospital in Bulgaria should be the best possible."
The healthcare sector has passed a comprehensive way at the end of the 1990s.
Instead of resources in the communist era and a new model, economic, legal and financial independence for health companies.
They and hospitals have become independent monitoring of the new National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), which was established by payments agency.
However, other changes that will help increase efficiency and quality have stalled due to lack of political will.
"We will focus on the reform because we are delayed in the degree," Borissova told reporters in Sofia.
At the same time, he stressed that the decisions will be taken only after high-profile assessment and preparations.
Borissova cited the definition of professional standards for the sector employees and a "national healthcare map" with lack of information on the country ’ s health system.
Borissova, a professor at the Endoinologist and a professor at the Sofia Foundation, replaced Bozhidar Nanev, who resigned in March over the purchase of the activist Tamiff in late last year.
In a recent report on the activities of 2009, the ministry said the launch of health system reforms and implementation of implementation is one of the main priorities.
In addition to the reduction of expenditures in the economic crisis, Nanev also warned that dozens of hospitals operating in the region will have to be closed.
The number of hospitals in Bulgaria has increased from 293 to 414 in the past nine years, Borissova said.
This means the EU average of 3 hospital hospitals in Bulgaria, with an average of 100,000 people, but about 4.6 hospitals have dropped.
"This is a great increase of these hospitals consumption public resources and our resources have not changed their levels, but no one of the current hospitals will not be closed," he said.
The lack of professionalism is another important problem in the sector.
"There is no doctor who did not leave Bulgaria," the Sofia News Agency quoted Borissova as saying. "The number of doctors are only half of the real needs of Bulgaria.
This is a disaster. "
The low wage, low health care status and the poor administration of the system is only one of the problems in the health care sector, an Austrian doctor with 22 years of experience in Otinology, told SETimes.
"The initiative of the Health system was destroyed," he said in a couple of secret circumstances.
He is responsible for "mobile" models "in the beginning of the reform process, which has been launched more than ten years ago in the system.
However, other employees in the medical sector do not agree, and they are encouraging that the new ministry will not happen.

The OSCE decided on Thursday (September 18th) to suspend talks with Georgia on additional observers to send a major obstacle to the deal, citing Russian stance on its position in South Ossetia.
"Despite a month of negotiations, there is no compromise on observers," Antti Tunen, the head of the 56-nation security organisation, said. "There is no way to resume negotiations in Vienna."
Tunen, who heads the OSCE headquarters this year, said all diplomatic ways to reach a compromise and that the entities will now wait their requests for their own governments.
OSCE spokesman Martin Nesirky said the issue is "political door" and should be released between the capital. "
On August 19th, members of the largest security organisation in Europe decided to increase the number of OSCE military monitors in Georgia.
Two arms officers arrived in neighbouring South Ossetia on August 12th to deepen the shooting between Moscow and Tiflis.
In line with the decision last month, the rest of the OSCE observers will be a new decision that would be applied for officers' duties and the current 20-strong group in Georgia.
Russia says eight OSCE military observers in Georgia, which are currently holding a five-day conflict with Russia before August 7th, could be revived, Russia says.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed that the OSCE plan to send additional observers to the region is an attempt to cancel South Otia to cancel its independence recognised by Russia and Nijaga.
Voicing regret about the suspension of the talks, Russian ambassador to the OSCE Anka Azimov said on Thursday that his country is ready to "continue dialogue".
Azimov insisted that international observers should participate in "independent South Ossetia".
Georgia 'OSCE representative, Denata Gosrrashi, also called for the continuation of talks.
According to Gosrascic, the observers did not allow Russia to enter South Otia, as Russia wants to see an independent state treatment of Georgia.
A Western diplomat who was secret of secret diplomat told Reuters that Moscow could have a possible reason for its stance, and that it is an effort to "huge ethnic cleansing" against Georgia ".
Nevertheless, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warned Russia on Thursday that "there is no way to return to isolation and beautiful isolation" and urged the West to stop Moscow "candidacy".

Despite the arrest of human trafficking suspects in Montenegro, the scandal is still under way.
Earlier December, former Montenegrin Interior Minister Andrija Jovicevic accused Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic of trying to tackle his relationship.
A Moldovan woman claimed that a organised crime organisation, linked to high-level officials, has been forced to prostitution.
According to Jovicevic, high-ranking figures in the Montenegrin government used their influence.
Jovicevic has so far failed to prove his role in the scandal, while Djukanovic accused Jovicevic of finding money to avoid political reputation.
The reason for the post of Prime Minister Jovicevic is not the human trafficking scandal, but poor performance, he added.
Djukanovic also said the incident was a conspiracy aimed at spreading Montenegro 'reputation, but did not show evidence that would support the indictment.
In connection with the scandal, four people were arrested, including Chief Prosecutor Zoran Piperovic.
Montenegrin courts, however, stopped the case with lack of evidence, and indictees were released from the monitoring.
Molden women fled Montenegro.
The OSCE experts, whose police and the courts' work on the case, presented their reports in late November.
Experts said the Montenegrin state institutions have shown a number of mistakes and accommodation, and the secret police have been involved in the case by the end of the day.
As a result, authorities in Podgorica have suggested that the entire process would take place.
The Montenegrin government said the process could restore if new evidence.
The police, however, has not been able to start evidence so far.
The head of the OSCE mission in Serbia-Montenegro, Maurizio Massmir, urged the Montenegrin government to implement recommendations in the OSCE expert report.

The US Defence Department said its annual Human Rights Report, published on February 25th, is increasingly demanding more personal and political freedom in the world.
Corruption noted a series of human rights problems, such as restrictions on media freedom, and heavy legal arrangements aimed at reducing the number of NGOs.
In the 2008 report, six witnesses are involved in regional assessment. The European and Eurasian assessment of the world "strengthening new democracy" and "huge crimes and hidden speech" is still a key problem, including protecting basic freedom, "the European and Eurasian report said.
The report also wants governments to block the work of NGOs operating on human rights and to allow pressure without pressure.
In the eight Balkan countries' report on eight Balkan countries, Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia -- are "overall respect for the human rights of citizens," the authorities said in a number of areas.
The Romanian government "focused on some problems related to human rights in 2008," the State Department said, adding that the violations of rights in the country continue.
Despite improvement in some areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, authorities are "weakness" by last year.

According to the State Department, the only country in the eight countries is "in line with international standards".
Most other countries said the penalties are extremely excessive, even in Croatia, are insufficient.
The report said freedom of speech and press freedom, all of the eight countries, including the laws of these eight countries, and the governments of Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia and Romania "have implemented these rights".

In Croatia, the government has been effective on the media, while Montenegro continued to stop some restrictions.
The media reports in Macedonia "no citizens" have been criticised by authorities, affecting press freedom in the country.
In BiH, the State Department said, "the government has declined to speak and media freedom in 2008".
In Serbia, the government said it is said to intervene freedom.
The National laws continue to be one of the most important problems in the region, although the legitimate irregularities are banned and serious penalties on this issue.
The State Department said authorities in BiH, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia and Serbia have been involved in unprecedented jobs and did not punish the penalty.
"Despite the arrest of many high-ranking local and central government officials, corruption remains an important obstacle in front of the reform process and a serious problem for countries," the report said.
In Croatia, the government has made improvements in the official institution, which is acting to fight corruption.

The law on Hungarians could affect Serbia 'EU process
In Serbia, ethnic Hungarians in Serbia say they have been forced from the extradition of contemporary property.
Now, Budapest intervened.
By Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 06 / 10 / 11
Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Zodt Semjen said the extradition law is unacceptable. [Agraffairs]
The Hungarian leaders, who protested the law, said their countries would review Serbia 'support for EU membership.
"We do not know you with the EU, but the public does not be realistic with the laws that have the rights of civil rights," Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Zleft Semjen said during a visit to Subotica, who lives in the north of Serbia, during a visit to Subotica on Sunday (October 2nd), where he lives a intensive ethnic Hungarian population.
The problem is due to a law adopted last week by the Serbian parliament, which has adopted a concept of property and compensation.
The adoption of the law is a condition for EU membership.
However, one of the provisions of the law envisions that the property of workers in the World War II and their heritage will not be extradited to them.
The Hungarian parties in Serbia say the measure is untrue because it is not affected by their own willingness, or no criminal Hungarians.
"The law represents the principle of individual responsibility, but we are convinced that the constitution is more than the article of the constitution and not in accordance with Eurupa principles," said Istvan Pastor, head of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians, a member of Serbia ’ s ruling coalition.
Pastor said the law would call for the assessment of the constitution.
Meanwhile, Semjen called on Serbia to change "in the part of the Progress" that is unacceptable, which would allow the Hungarian society to "provide compensation".
About 350,000 Hungarians live in Serbia.
In response to SETimes, Deputy Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic told SETimes that Serbia is against genocide, but no one has asked to reinforce some of the opponents against the World War II.
He also said Serbian authorities would try to convince the Hungarian community that the law does not convince the rule of crime, but pointed out that the current structure does not have the mandate of parliament to change the law.
Nenad Canak, leader of the Vojvodina Social Democratic Union of Vojvodina, has been more clear.
"If we are doing our citizens with the EU, we will choose between our citizens and to reconciliate the river, we will think.
We will think that this is an EU and we will think we want to join them, "he said.
Smiljana Vukoyicic, director of the EurActiv website, told SETimes on 12 October that Serbia will likely receive candidate status from the European Commission.
"However, all members must accept it in December.
At this point, Hungary could be able to put Serbia on the road and we see the incidents that the candidate countries are blocking the right progress towards EU membership because of their disagreements with EU member states, "he said.
A number of physical clashes between Serbs and Hungarians in the village of Conererin was completely needed.
The NGO coalition of Civil Vojvodina, Dinko Group, believes these incidents are low.
"Ahead of the election, the incidents in the region are increasingly increasing.
"The incidents in the Contact should not be exaggerated, but the ethnic communities who live, who live, will live," he said.

A new Eurostat survey published on Monday (October 3rd) that it was easier for four years ago for financing and medium-sized enterprises in Bulgaria and other 19 EU member states.
However, the survey, based on the results of the loan applications for such companies in 20 countries that can reach data, however, concludes that the economic crisis began to broadcast the world, the economic crisis is increasingly difficult for businesses.
The swimming of the KOMEs' demands, which were rejected as general, has increased at least in all countries who participated in the poll outside Sweden.
According to Eurostat, the number of success credit applications was the biggest increase in Bulgaria, including 3% in 2007 to 36% in 2010.
The Balkan country is the highest country in the rest of the credit application of 20 countries that participated in the survey.
Furthermore, successful loan applications have dropped in Bulgaria, the number of SMEs, which can be able to receive the money in circumstances, from 87% to 43% in 2007.
Ivaylo Georgiev, the owner of the US-based Metal M, is among the applications for bank loans at the time to take the need for the business capital.
The main bank of Georgiev, however, was restored with the need for a credit demand.
The businessman also received a loan that needs at the end of the year, but it is not easy.
"The researchers came five minutes.
Of course, the Talew was removed, but the post-revised review was passed and the application was approved by the end, "he said." Of course, we received about seven months to find the finance. "
But Ivan Midazov, a initiative at the Black Sea coastal coastal coastal resort, has not been chance, but it is not regret.
Following the beginning of the crisis, he wants to build a hotel and sell a hotel, but the investment loan was rejected.
Initiative said bank inspectors are rising the project.
"It was better better because the ratification has approved the ratification because the ratification of the loan in recent years would be unable to pay the loan," he told SETimes.
Georgi Angelov of the Open Society Institute (OSI) in Sofia said Bulgaria has spent a long term of economic growth and has caused a continuous increase in market sales.
"Therefore, the financial situation is very easy to get loans because it seems to have the potential for growth of companies," Angelov said.

Markopoulos, who is also a resident of the mafia, says that "Each investments will be some of the destinations.
We have never been invested in this field, and now we think we have a cheaper. "
According to Spirias, the government is now aware that it is no longer aware of potential investors who do not see the bureaucracy processes, such as the city.
Spirias, who has sold many Chinese companies, especially in Cosco, says that in this context, many Chinese companies have a major investments in the Piraeus of the Piraeus, noting that the law that closed the way of a large profit, has been cancelled.
Support Spirias said the number of companies that have been concerning the business circumstances in the country as a VOA -- the Greek Chamber of Commerce -- has increased every day, noting that the situation in the country is not worse to avoid investment.
At the same time, the new coalition government, led by former European Central Bank Vice President Lucas Papademos, is responsible for the continuation of international aid and said that "If there are new measures to ensure that the country will be able to become a investor, the country should take new measures before the April elections," he said.

The Greek Finance Ministry has increased direct tax on goods sold to European standards, which are sold to a move.
The initiatives have been discovered, but the government insists that there is no other option.

Greek Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis said the VAT increase is essential to achieve the target of 3 per cent of GDP by the end of 2006. [AFP]
Finance Minister George Alogoskoufis has recently sparked the government to 19 per cent in recent efforts to bring the Greek economy to European standards.
The amendment took effect as of 1 April.
He said the tax hike is essential to achieve the goal of reducing debt, but businesses say they have been given only a week to seek prices.
The government declined to 25 per cent of business taxes from 35 per cent to 20 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises, but businesses oppose violence.
Both opposition and Alogosfis' own New Democracy party criticised the move.
Alogosfis acknowledged that this could have a short term negative impact on the economy, but argues that there is no other option.
Greece is currently under pressure from the Union to prevent the budget deficit of 3 per cent of GDP by the end of 2006.
To do so, the finance ministry must receive more money than 2 billion euros from the initial target.
Alogoskoufis said Brussels will never approve a programme that will try to overcome public spending only by reducing public spending.
The finance ministry announced a number of measures aimed at improving the economy.
In addition to reducing public enterprises, the ministry plans a major initiative to end tax evasion.
Greece has one of the highest tax evasion rates in Europe, as well as due to the patients' intellectual mistakes, as well as broadcast and economic activities.
Three witnesses' position on the labour point is the country becoming a repression of goods smuggling.
The ministry has now been trying to cover illegal imports and take the right channels that they can be able to exchange them.
Another taxes are on Greek citizens.
Alkol and cigarette tax will be sparked -- the 80 residents will increase to 1.40 euros today.
The state seems to implement tax on the property, and new property will be subject to the VAT as of January 1st 2006.
The increase will also be affected by two per cent to three per cent per cent per cent, while the increase will also affect.
Furthermore, the VAT reduction on the Aegean islands will be released.
The reduction of the tax was found in a bid to bring life to people.
Alogosfis voiced hope that inflation will not increase by 1 per cent, while the estimates show that the rate will be around 4 per cent in April.
The Greek Central Bank, meanwhile, found that economic development in key sectors is slowly slowed, and it is shared in construction, textile, tourism, insurance and passenger transportation.
Ashdown: BiH Police Reform for EU Says
Paddy Ashdown warned on Tuesday that Bosnia and Herzegovina politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina must restore the police force to move towards the EU.
If they do not do so, he added, other countries in the region will remain in the ground.
(Office of the Office of the High Representative -- 19 / 04 / 05; Fena, Online - 19 / 04 / 05)
"Police reform remains the last major obstacle that BiH must meet negotiations on its own Stabilisation and Association Agreement," High Representative Paddy Ashdown said. [OHR]
High Representative Paddy Ashdown on Tuesday (April 19th) urged politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to reach a compromise on police reform, a critical precondition that the country must meet in the EU integration process.
"Police reform continues to continue the last major way BiH must be able to start negotiations on its own Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA)," Ashdown said at a meeting with leaders of the Federation of BiH 'Parliament.
The meeting took place a few days before the start of political talks on restructuring the country &aposs police, the start of political talks on April 24th.
A consultant to the European Commission (EC) will arrive in BiH in mid-May to assess the progress BiH has made in fulfilling the 16 requirements in the feasibility study.
A positive assessment will allow the start of SAA talks, the first important step towards eventual EU membership.
According to Ashdown, the issue and problems on the agenda are resolved, including "we can reach a constructive co-operation with the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague".
However, Ashdown added, the green light for SAA talks could only be closed after all preconditions are met.
BiH leaders must reach an official agreement on police reform ", the High Representative said." Thus, BiH will be responsible for delays in the end of the EU membership targets ".
Among the circumstances that Brussels has suggested on police reform, the police law and the budget of the state level, ensuring political intervention and the protection of protecting the functioning criteria, which is based on the police reform criteria.
"If we are convinced, these talks will bring BiH to an extraordinary aspect system to win the fight against crime," Ashdown said. "If we will be able to stop BiH in Europe.
I am not sure that I will be based on me, but it is a decision that we have to reach an agreement on us. "
As the EC issued a positive feasibility study for Serbia-Montenegro last week, the British diplomat said that this is a clear sign that BiH 'membership in the EU has become a priority of its neighbours.
"The main political fans in BiH -- both the ruling and opposition -- have the opportunity to prove that the country is intended to achieve this goal and prove BiH can enter Europe," Ashdown said.
Police reform was also among the issues that the EUPM Commissioner Kevin Carty met with the head of the Brcko District Police Service in BiH on Tuesday, Milenko Milicevic and members of the EUPM team operating here.
"The reasons for the police reform in BiH is clear," Carty said. "The current security forces of BiH are not functioning, and there is no strong impact of various political parties."
If the country wants to start EU membership talks, the EUPM said the country must restructuring the police force -- two options in front of BiH politicians -- will accept the restructuring of police, or the European door. "
Mesic to Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader

(FT - 10 / 12 / 03; AFP, Reuters, BBC, Croatia Information Centre - 09 / 12 / 03)
Croatian President Stipe Mesic arrived on Tuesday (December 9th) as prime minister of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) leader Ivo Sanader. The centre-right party, which won a third of the votes in the November 23rd elections, has 30 days to form a new government.
Sanader, who cited key priorities for EU and NATO integration, said his cabinet would submit parliament approval on December 22nd.
"Our priority is to increase living standards in our country, accept NATO and EU membership, and solve the current problems with our neighbours," Sanader said after talks with Mesic.
The HDZ, which has 66 seats in the new 152 seats, is expected to form a coalition government with a small party, the centre-right Democratic Central Bank (DC) and a violent Social Liberal Party (HSLS).
Voicing support for the party &aposs government, HSLS leader Drazen Budisa said his party would decide on Saturday and not participate in the HDZ coalition.
DC leader Major Granic said on Tuesday that his party supports the vote in a coalition government that would be formed with the party.
Members of parliament representing pensions with ethnic minorities, said they are ready to support the government on key issues such as the budget and reforms that would bring the country to the EU bid.
Sanader, 50, a student in Austria, seems to be excellent and wrote five languages and does not recognise US President George W. Bush as one of the main supporters of his policies.
One of the challenges that Sanader is awaiting, the HDZ will be to avoid an international image in the field of weaknesses in the 199-2000 era period of human rights and the economy, as well as in the past nationalist policies.
The HDZ, founded by the post-president, Franjo Tudjman, was forced by the country before independence, and then international isolation.
Sanader, however, claims that his party is a nationalist past, and now has no longer been trying to work for Croatia to join the EU and NATO.
The international community, which does not leave the cautious precautionary, called on international standards, particularly human rights.
"The respect of international and European human rights standards and the support of them is the aim of the new Croatian government to be expected," said Peter Semneby, head of the OSCE Mission in Croatia.
In a statement by EU foreign ministers, the EU foreign affairs ministers said Croatia has fully supported the European perspectives of Europe, urging policies to be parallel to the Union &aposs membership criteria.
"This is the most important point, full co-operation with the ICTY, return of refugees and minority rights."
Foreign Minister Tonino Picula, who approached the end of his mandate, said the Sanader government has made a chance to prove the pro-European stance. "However, this will be very difficult.
"It is a separate thing to defend it every day."

Polls Will "Corruption" in Bulgaria
Representatives of commercial bodies from around the world, who met in Sofia, called on Bulgaria to take steps against corruption, saying they have a serious obstacle in front of the country development.
By Ivelina Puhaleva for Southeast European Times in Sofia - 06 / 01 / 04
At a business conference in Sofia last month by international organisations and experts, participants concluded that corruption in Bulgaria is a serious obstacle in front of the countries' initiatives.
According to Kirko Kirkov, head of the Bulgarian International Trade Association, the companies are seen as "wrong, but inevitable, efficient and active".
"Corruption is always austerity in relations between companies and the state administration.
This is not good, because we do not have any plans, "he said.
The Association is foreign and Bulgarian businessmen. About 200 businesses and businesses, including Paris, Citibank, the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce, Coj-Cola, Denmara and Shell, are members of the company.
Kirkov said the authorities in the state administration should be given a final deadline to implement "money or" forecasts ".
The most privatisation, public employment, tax services, exports and imports, is widely widespread in the business system.
Some businessmen are closer to the opening of a new political party in Bulgaria from opening a new political party.
The effect of corruption on the economy is difficult, but foreign investments are sent to concern.
In addition, corruption, organised crime organisations enabled the law on the border or except of work, enabling prison activities.
Greek-foreign investors are crucial to the execution of courts from the cheaper force.
According to data published by the Institute for Political Economy, corruption is a decline of 0.9 per cent to 1.2 per cent in GDP.

For example, only one must be allowed to operate in the communication sector in Finland, while the figure was 12 in Bulgaria.
Representatives of the International Chamber of Commerce have suggested that "preparation for access to public institutions and clear procedures", as well as the establishment of an effective and effective control mechanism against those who violate them.
The transparency of state administration representatives' activities is crucial.

"Our health system that we have created us is not in the system of some people working in the health system, but not the public," Romanian Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu said at a joint session. [Getty Images]
The Romanian centre-right government on Tuesday (February 21st) ordered the parliamentary confidence vote on Tuesday (February 21st), which also guaranteed the medical reform package aimed at improving the health system in the country and to bring the EU norms.
After four hours of five-hour and highly politicised debate, the ruling coalition won the vote with 246 votes against 214.
Several deputies representing parties in the ruling coalition have reportedly supported the opposition.
Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu, who wants to avoid parliamentary debate and ensure that the proposed bill have taken responsibility for the laws last week, saying the government has taken responsibility for special forces.
The opposition Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Greek-Romanian Party (PRM) have described the laws as "critical of reform", calling the question. PSD, which was in power between 2000-2004, argued that the proposed reforms would damage citizens in the streets and that social rights will limit social rights.
"The real benefits of this law are tensions and we are not opposed to the government 'anti-society and the constitutional initiative," said PSD Vice-President Titus Corlatean. "This reform is the biggest problem of the health system."
Following the PSD responsible for the poor situation of the country ’ s health care system, Tariceanu said the opposition is to avoid the way of designed health reforms designed to improve the damage of this move.
"Our health system that we have created us is not in the system of the people, but in the public," the prime minister said at a joint parliamentary session.
In a speech last week, Tariceanu said the improvement of state support in the health sector has failed to resolve problems such as property, conflict and corruption, as well as the lack of widespread financial disciplinary, safety and transparency.
"The bankruptcy has been continued, but the public has sparked the health," Tariceanu said, noting that only Romania spent 2.8m euros in 2005.
According to a World Bank report, Reuters reported that Romanian citizens have provided 303m euros for health services in 2004.
Around three months before the government proposed reforms were submitted to parliament, health experts, hospitals, politicians and others were discussed by public opinion.
The pact includes laws on national health programmes, public and private health insurance systems and hospitals.
The doctors are interested in separate laws with the status quo of pharmaceutics, pharmaceutics and exercises.
Corruption, improving health care services and legal provisions aimed at boosting new taxes and improving the revenues of the unfortunate system, including measures to boost the safety of health services.
The next step, the PSD said on Tuesday, would be reluctant to the Constitutional Court if the health reform laws are under way.

"We want to support this efficient method that will be used in implementing commercial disputes in Macedonia," said IFC Journalism Director Antoe Labrousic. [File]
A new law drafted by the Macedonian government suggests that reconciliation as a judicial mechanism for resolving disagreements.
The law, which is part of a general judicial reform package aimed at meeting EU criteria, is implemented in trade, business, workers and consumption disputes, but will not be implemented, penalties and administrative issues.
The compromise, an alternative to the case, is a method that has the potential to foster the risk of the judiciary and increase efficiency.
Among other countries that have been implemented, the experience of the agreement shows that small and medium-sized enterprises are the first group that seems to be a approach.
The agreement helps two sides in the dispute, a third entity for a acceptable solution.
The project is transparent and transparency, with a mutual agreement between the two sides.
The salary for this service is set by a list of preparations.
While the same finding is a catch, another colleague could be able.
Everything has to have the documentary of the Arab findings Court, which has been involved in this role.
This month, the Justice ministry signed a memorandum of understanding on developing a efficient compromise system in the next three years, part of the World Bank Group.
"We are very willing to revive this efficient mechanism to address commercial disputes in Makodonia.
This is an important part of our strategy to promote a limited private sector and improve the overall business climate, "he said.
The initiative is part of the Government Convention project, which the IFC launched in 2004 with the financial support of the Netherlands.
Since then, a legal framework for reconciliation has been sparked, three training programmes for 50 medical candidates have been distributed and a ADR conference was held in a bid to promote the use of reconciliation.

The Vetevendosje move was classified with police in a protest aimed at closing two border crossings with Serbia.

Albanian supporters of the Vetevendosje (Kendernje) Movement, the Albanian supporters of the Top, are seemed early on Saturday (January 14th) in Tirana.
The demonstrators arrived on the Kosovo border with Serbia, in an effort to help Serbian goods blocked Kosovo. [Reuters]
On Saturday (January 14th), police used two border crossings between Serbia and Serbia, Merdar / Merdare and Dheu Bardhe / Bela Zemlja against protesters who stopped in protest in the villages of Dheu / Bela Zemlja.
The government has not implemented the decision of parliament to implement full political, economic and commercial practice against Serbia, saying the opposition "Vetevendosje" (Kendi) organised the demonstration.
The move announced that some demonstrators are true in the Podujevo region near Merdar / Merdare.
Kosovo TV reported that a police spokesperson was detained by 14 demonstrators and eight police officers were injured.
Among the injuries, the move said that Vetevendosje leader Colin Kurti was also involved and was implemented before he returned to the protest.
The government of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci has charged the government of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who has "destroyed the Republic of Kosovo and forced Kosovo in front of Serbia", the Movement says, adding that local production is protected.
None of the details are not part of the country &ap91; dominated northern part of the country, which has been convicted since the summer.
Earlier on Saturday, he told reporters that intensive security measures will not change their plans, while he reiterated that the protests would not be able to block the free movement of people, but not the free movement of Serbian goods to Kosovo.
He was stopped by police fears at about 400 hours, and police accused people of obstructing their lives.
The ministry will fulfil its mandate as part of its mandate to prevent any obstacles, the interior ministry said in a press release.
"Some citizens will not be allowed to protest and exercise their intolerance, to be allowed to abuse the free movement of other citizens and goods on the Republic of Kosovo," the ministry said.
The ministry asked the public to support the legitimate opposition forms, stressing that the Kosovo Police will show "tolerance" against the provisional closure of roads ".
He told his cabinet on Wednesday that the patriography should be recognised as full respect for the Kosovo Constitution and laws.
"The perspective of the Kosovo state is not in barricades, but integration."
Kosovo President Atiff Jahjaga stated to Vetevendosje, saying that "the possibilities of action that could be done within the state institutions", in implementing the street demonstration.
"As there is any other incidents, I am confident that the president is against the actions that block the free and goods of human and goods," he said.
France, Germany, Italy and Britain also urged Vetevendosje to avoid any violence or disappointed Kosovo Police staff.
"Such actions will not only be violated, but will also increase tensions in Kosovo and affect the image of Kosovo abroad," the envoy said in a statement.
The Kosovo Police, who supported EULEX and KFOR, said they are confident that the Kosovo Police will "show check and professionalism with any provocation", adding that "the results of the planned action would be responsible for Vvendosje".
The EU Special Representative for Kosovo Fernando Gyseni warned that any actions to remove the obstacles are the risk of the progress made so far.
"I call on these freedom to stop from the actions aimed at blocking these freedom, because such actions do not have any other job from the European agenda," he said in a statement.
Kurti wants support from neighbouring Albania, but the foreign ministry has responded to a statement saying that some Albanians in Kosovo and Albania "condemned their excessive calls for closing border crossings with Serbia".
Nevertheless, a bus was stopped by police at the Morine border crossing with Kosovo on Saturday.
Other political parties in Kosovo do not support the planned obstacle, but various NGOs, companies and unions are divided.
Kosovo political commentator Belul Beqaj, a student at the university, told SETimes that the closure of border crossings could be "unprecedented action", but Vetevendosje will not be injured without the consequences of political targets. "
Judicial retail prices and state intervention sparks Serbian consumers
The state intervention has dropped profits on some concerts in Serbia, including the lowest in the region.
By Katica Djurovic and Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade -- 14 / 01 / 12
Some economists say the lack of competitiveness has increased food prices in Serbia. [Reuters]
A regular arrangement aimed at reducing food prices has already been reduced to 10%, thanks, water, subsidies and intellectual profits.
However, the intervention aims to protest protests, warning that the arrangement would lead to the closure of several small and medium-sized enterprises.
The constitution, which took effect this month and is due to the end of July 1st, was reduced to 30% of profits on some events.
Serbia has one of the lowest salaries in Southeast Europe and citizens spend half of their salaries at average.
Authorities hope that the reduction of the maraths would increase the request and allow people to purchase more.
"No one should be happy in order to organise administrative measures, but there are no other methods to establish the balance in the market, which the real competitiveness reflects high margines," said Agriculture and Trade Minister Dusan Petrovic.
Some analysts doubt the arrangement will produce long-term results.
"The food in Serbia is too expensive, because production costs are low, another huge," Marica Vukovic, director of the Beta News Agency, told SETimes.
"If we will see the agricultural products, it is more expensive than Europe because the state subsidies are lower than in Europe, and all countries are able to retain agriculture, while the agriculture budget in Serbia is low in terms of both nominal and lower than the GDP in other countries," he said.
The main reason for accepting the arrangement is the upcoming election period, Vukovic says.
Serbia must hold general elections in May.
Vukovic also expects the arrangement to give significant consequences.
"The austerity in the Hane budget will be stood in major families that are only large amounts, shifts, dynamic and food," he said.
Most of the Economic Institute in Belgrade, Migrt Busatlija, is not waiting a major outcome.
"In Serbia, food is expensive because of the explosion on imports.
Only a few companies are operating in this area, and they are not food from European producers, but also from some customs space commissions.
This means that imports cannot be really realistic, and this money is coming from Serbia, "he said.
The average salaries in Southeast European countries. [official]
The average salary in Serbia is about 376 euros and inflation rate is 8.1%.
The unemployment rate is around 20%.
In Southeast Europe, only the average salary in Macedonia is low from Serbia.
The average salary in Slovenia is 975 euros and 715 euros in Croatia.
"The prices of our products in our countries are affected by the market, including the brand, the purchase of the category and transportation, electricity, power, deposits," Slobodan Rudan told SETimes.
He serves as Storm Director in Delhaw Group, who managed the Maxi and Conpo retail stations in Southeast Europe.
Earlier this month, the price databases were more expensive than 111 to 113 cities, another huge, Podgorica and Skopje, before they entered into effect this month.
The major cities in the region have changed prices between 70 and 80 euros per little, while consumers at the Serbian market received 85 to 90 euros.
The Movement for Consumer Protection says Serbian clients have decided to decide at the rate of bronze sales in a very unique arbitration due to insufficient control.
"Everything has been developed.
Therefore, the same product can be different in a supervision market in Belgrade and a small share in central Serbia, "he said.
According to Bogosavljevic, the purchase decrease has declined to attract climate consumption and reduce prices and marches to increase profits.
But prices in Serbia are continued, he said.
Bogosavljevic says the ongoing increase in profit rates is the main reason for competitiveness.
The development of new megas-markets means more competitiveness, low margines and lower prices.
"This is why we will pay the retail retail that allows them to achieve high profits without fear competition," Dragan Milicevic, an analyst for retail margineers in Serbia, told SETimes.
First prices are unhappy, consumers and many are willing to reduce ways to find more efficient prices.
"I go to the Romanian city of Karisoara, in order to buy electronic, clothes, clothes and food," said Vesna Vlajic, a penal bank disease.
I will continue to go to Romania if the retail retail retail will come from Serbia, cheaper and cheaper retail markets arrive in Serbia, or local car prices are reduced to Serbia, "he said.

Now the party is preparing to discuss the government, as well as the president.

The registration process of president candidates in Turkey began on Monday (April 16th) and will continue until 25 April.
As the head of the state parliament was elected by Parliament, the majority of political analysts expect Ahmet Necdet Sezer to receive a candidate from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).
All observers are Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Many will have to leave the party leader before the parliamentary elections, as the AKP is the possible candidate for the AKP, which will have to weaken the AKP as a potential.
The AKP was banned from the Islamic Relations Party, which was banned in 1998, in which Turkey has already been banned by its constitutional principles.
Sezer, who served as a judge at the constitutional court, said the party was closed to "because the secularist republics are acting against the principles of the republic".
In 2001, Erdogan ordered the new party as a conservative party of the Christian Democratic parties in Western Europe.
Since the AKP arrived in power, the AKP has led a spot in the economy and the start of accession talks with the EU.
At the same time, Erdogan has also been criticised by some of the steps taken by the state to undermine the secularism of public employees -- for example -- to remove the law on the headscarf of public employees and make a crime.
They argue that such movements are proof that the AKP is a former Islamist-rotating staff.
The party has accused political Islam of trying to change Turkey 'political culture by bringing top managers in the system to change the basis of its political culture.
"The interim threat has not changed the target of the state to change the basic character of the state," Sezer told Parliament on the first day of the year. "The interpretation of the Law is to repeat the religious level and cause social tensions to expand the threat of a political level."
This days when the AKP is prepared to address both the government and the president, the warnings have become more important.
Sezer said last week at the Harp School that Turkey has been formed since the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, "there is no serious threats".
"democratic and secular structures, as well as the protection of the state," the president said.
The Turkish Army chief of General Staff Jasar Bureau said that the army would be ready to intervene if Turkey sees a threat to secular foundations.
"How do you think they need to revive any opportunity?
How do you see the state in the highest positions?
What is the right to be a threat of fundamental principles of the Republic?
If there is no response to these questions, there are radical Islamic threats in Turkey and this threat should be any measures against the threat. "
At the weekend, hundreds of thousands of people stopped in Ankara, saying Erdogan opposed the possibility of candidacy.
Erdogan rejected criticism.
During a visit to the United States last October, the prime minister said the threat against the Turkish secularism is not the existence and that debate is impossible.
Erdogan urged authorities to avoid statements that would lead to unnecessary tensions in the country.
The next president will begin the election process on 26 April or 3 May.
The most four round of votes will be held.

"The real reason for the protests of Albanians in South Serbia should not be abused for education, and not abuse for education, political purposes," Obradovic told SETimes.
The nationalist opposition in Serbia has doubts.
"This is the same strategy for the strategy of political options in Kosovo, when Albanians in the 1980s," Dragan Todorovic, deputy head of the Serbian Radical Party, told SETimes.
However, the Serbian government believes the Presevo, Bujanovac and Medvedja Co-ordination Council believes the protests are not impossible.
Minister of Co-ordination Council President and State and Local Rights, Milan Markovic, says the three Albanian municipalities have invested significant funding in the development of the three Albanian municipalities.
However, Markovic added, there are still serious problems and that solution is the education ministry.
"If the Albanians do not apply for other national minorities in Serbia to apply for other national minorities, we will decrease that these communities are not integration in institutions," Markovic told SETimes. "This could become a major problem."
Hundreds of young people in Serbia seems to have no news from the problems of the southern fans.
"I do not know that the bodies are in the language, but I think that the country should be Serbian, because it is the official language of our country," Belgrade student Vladimir Spasic told SETimes.
Croatian Authorities Progress

The sale of the Smokoke Male name, Valadria, has sold to the Croatian Prosecutor 'Office. [wwwww.ker.hr]
In late last month, Croatian media reported that several Adriatic islands were sold in suspects and selling millions of euros.
Following that, the prosecution requested the request of the sale of the coastal assets.
As a result, more than 2m euros will not get new owners of the Smokoke Male and Financial Krknjas, the new owners of the islands, which are the most valuable.
Observers are located near the villages of Sibenik, Zadar and Trogir.
Financial Krknjas company Smokokymic bought Valadria company Malda Krknjas.
While the figures in the incident have sparked suspects in public affiliation, they were demanded to accept their relationship.
"With the official loss in the Tetovo, the coastal coastal coastal coastal cannot be subjected to private property.
Therefore, we will demand the establishment of a state-owned coastal coastal coastal coastal resort, which is purchased by the MP Krknjas company.
We will have a case that we will ask the sale of the sale agreement from the sea assets. "
Valadria has established a US company on Traenton & Party bodies.
Prosecutors, however, say they do not know that he is fully in the job.
The controversial function was more controversial.
Fratter and Frattic, near the south of the Istria coastal coastal coast, adopted by the Adriatic, was acquitted by Frasker in 2000.
Miodrag Saubic and Mikhail Pevtsav, who allegedly supported Russian and Czech investors, were planning to spend 16.5m euros in spending their name to the services of tourism.
However, the Medulin Community, the judicial authority on the islands, decided to not allow any city without approval by local residents.
Those are not prepared for a city development plan for them, as they are not allowed to build construction on the islands.
Therefore, there is no economic potential to investors.
Therefore, the prosecution is working in co-operation with the tax agency and the police to find that the companies buying the islands are really really.
The Supreme Authority for the Kara Para Authority has also launched an investigation to learn that the money used to purchase justice is not entering Croatia on legal ways.
Many expect the new owners to request advertisements in the use of the state sea assets.
If such demands have been revenues, local autonomy will be promised.
Meanwhile, the prosecution announced that it will send a letter to the government and the Croatian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Company, demanding that the state would be more carefully active in order to transport the city and use of sea assets.

Macedonian Culture Minister Elizabeta Canukka-Milevska [Klaudija Lutovska / SETimes]
Macedonian Culture Minister Elizabeta Canukka-Milevska says the countries in the region can find a joint dimension through culture, even though the governments of the region are different.
In an interview with SETimes, Cangenka-Milevska discussed the importance of the culture in Macedonia 'EU integration process, the government has taken steps to promote the culture of the current government and the historical monument of the historical monument.
SETimes: What is the role of culture?
Elizabeta Canukka-Milevska: Our cultural identity in Macedonia is something that connects us with Europe and the rest of the world.
For the first time since Macedonia &aposs independence, the cultural state is in the centre of the development of the state and is becoming a function.
This government is charged with a culture of the past practices, for example, an external policy.
In the year, more than 65m euros have a basic fundamental funding and this is an important investment for Macedonia.
This growing interest is proven to be evident with various investments, such as a new archaeological museum, which will exhibit a large part of the Macedonian heritage in Skopje, built a new education museum complex in May 2011, and the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra.
In the past three years, we have revealed 20 of the 5,000 archaeological sites, including Stoyan, Heraklea, Isar-Marvest and Vardarski Rid.
I have to say that culture is a key part of the EU integration process.
The latest annual EC report released two weeks ago praised Macedonia for progress in culture.
SETimes: Do you see the importance of culture to connect Macedonia and other Balkan countries and the EU?
Canadika-Milevska: I am particularly satisfied that co-operation with countries in the region is very efficient.
All countries in the region have signed agreements in the cultural field, boosting interethnic and interethnic relations.
Governments have not been a common division, while cultural institutions have repeatedly finished.
For example, prominent Macedonian cinema and theatre directors Milco Mancevski and Slobodan Unkovski -- are working with Greece -- or or in.
In Croatia and Croatia, we have a comprehensive project, including exhibitions at the Contemporary Art Museum.
Macedonia has excellent relations with EU member states such as Slovenia and Austria.
Tallinn signed an agreement with Estonia or an agreement with Turkey in 2011, as we have done with Turkey in 2010.
Several winners from all sides have been able to win.
SETimes: How do Macedonia have a cultural policy?
Canadika-Milevska: Macedonia has a strategy that could be defined as a clear cultural policy, protecting and promotion.
We are operating in all areas of culture, such as gallers, theatre role, libraries, music-scene artists, international promotions and values, as well as local cultural development.
Culture, political and economic perspective may also be seen as a major sector.
There is an important economic deficit on the management of culture and how it is managing.
We are also interested in developing cultural tourism.
SETimes: How do you face challenges?
Canadika-Milevska: Macedonian cultural heritage is an important problem.
We have passed laws and seminars, and we continue to work closely with the interior ministry, but it is difficult to restore fans.
One of the most important archaeological sites of archaeological sites are being held through a lack of complete and systematic consequence.
In the ancient city of Stoyannis, for example, we turned it into a national institution and now has a service that protects it.
Cultural, liquidity, will not go on his own, because it is a move.
Each cultural event is a simple for us, as well as human success, even the country &aposs success.
SETimes: How do you share a certain success that has created a difference?
Canadika-Milevska: The status of Arts is changed.
We have been successful in a better assessment of the athletes' efforts to create art, and the transportation of transportation is more successful.
First, artists were injured to the project.
We have the highest level of intellectual artists and people in Macedonia now have full work.
That approach could also be reviewed by others in protecting regional artists.

Currently, 39 sports facilities are completed, and 13 per cent of them have been completed.
Among the ongoing projects, Spanish architecture Artiago Calatrava is worth 120m euros, worth 120m euros, which will close the main Olympic station.
Calatrava and Rogge have assured that both the Greek government will be removed in the time.
"I am interested in what the Games are withdrawn," Rogge said.
"I am completely happy with the functioning of the Stadyseni, but if I do not fulfil the function," he said, urging the organisation to be "life" and not a condition for projects.
One of the most concern is the pipeline and a trami pipeline, which has been in the past weeks, with a 30km-long bank that connects Athens' new airport facilities with the new airport.
With more than a million visitors are expected in August, both projects are considered critical.
"We will have to make a great effort to internal affairs," said Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskali, head of the 2004 Athens Olympics Committee for Organisation for Organised Crime. "However, we do not come to these challenges."
In security, Rogge said everything possible was made to prevent any incidents during the Games.
Greece has allocated more than 650m euros in a budget for the 2000 Sydney Games for security measures to take place in the players.
"What is you?
I am worried that in all the Olympic Olympics, after the latest athletes closed, I would be concerned.
Do you think there are more concerns that Athens is the situation or the other Olympics on Athens?
No, "he said.

Macedonians hope visa-free travel to the EU in 2009
There is a reality for Macedonians who want to visit the embassies and poverty documents that want to visit EU member states.
However, beautiful days could be close.

The positive comments from the EU have repeatedly repeatedly pushed that Macedonia could begin a full free visa regime in 2009.
A recent report on the implementation of a roadmap for visa liberalisation shows significant progress in a number of areas, including measures against documentary security and illegal immigration.
The visa issue is an important issue in Macedonia, where the application owners who are awaiting for a long time in foreign embassies have been found.
Earlier this year, the EU allowed citizens in some categories to be visa-free, allowing them to obtain visa liberalisation.
Nevertheless, this process continues to be a complex process of different documents and long-awaiting.
Skopje has taken a number of steps to meet EU standards.
Last year, biometric travel documents and ID cards were discovered.
Customs data are now better protected.
A deal on the bloc and reunification has been made significant progress.
However, the process is more than completed.
The European Commission announced a new assessment would be made in order to continue to move forward in early 2009.
Following this report, the foreign ministry says Macedonia will wait a positive response to meeting the requirements for EU member states.
The country has started work to provide support within the bloc and has already achieved a little success.
In November, members of the Macedonian Parliamentary Committee of Parliament and members of the EU parliamentary deputies held a joint meeting in Skopje, voiced support for visa liberalisation.
Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Ivica Bocevski recently met with Paris, French minister for European affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouge.
He made a strong statement that supports the Western Balkans' EU integration, including Macedonia.
Estonian foreign minister, meanwhile, said his country has made its support for visa liberalisation with Macedonia.
This should happen in 2009, he said.

lawmakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) rejected a parliamentary commission last week on two police reform committees, defence and security committee.
They decided on Tuesday (March 18th) to make a new idea for a committee to submit a new idea.
One party -- a party -- the Democratic Action Party (DPA) -- has voted against lawmakers from all ruling coalition parties, outside the committee.
High Representative Miroslav Lajcak, the top international envoy in BiH, praised parliament &aposs decision.
Lajcak said that this is a clear signal that lawmakers want to adopt a police reform law, a key condition for signing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
He also urged the defence and security committee to parliament to submit direct debate and vote on the police reform package.
"The European future of the BiH people -- what they live, the people of BiH, their behaviour or their behaviour -- is in the hands of 12 members of parliament, defence and security committee.
The people of BiH are a critical step on the path to EU membership and decide whether to sign the SAA, "he said.
He added that public support for EU membership is 70%.
The defence and security committee rejected two key bill on March 12th.
One was police officers' co-ordination directorate, and others were interested in independent and control bodies.
The Committee rejected all of the 93 amendments submitted to the bill.
Lajcak criticised the actions, saying the committee has been spent a valuable time.
"Each day of the Bosniak spending, it is impossible to sign the SAA," he said. "Parliament parties will decide on this issue, and the possibility of the European perspective of the people of BiH and the European perspective."
BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric urged the main political parties to restore laws.
"This means that we will sign the SAA," Spiric said.
"We are members of the Council of Ministers, but we decided that the most important thing is to be signed with the EU.
"The law on the European future of the country has not been dismissed," he added.

International officials confirmed on Tuesday (March 18th) that in UNMIK, a Ukrainian police officer has died from half of them, as a bombing explosion.
"There was a UNMIK police officer in northern Mitrovica," Police Commissioner Larry Wilson told reporters in a special press conference. "Memun Kynol is the name."
It was in Kosovo on December 17th last year, when Ukrainians took part in the Police Service. "
"There was a hundreds of bombings," said Special Representative Larry Rossin, who attended a congratulation with Wilson and KFOR commander Lieutenant General Xavier Bup Marnhac.
The total 42 international police officers were injured, Rossin said.
The violence was explosive on Monday, when UNMIK police and KFOR soldiers moved to restore control of the Mitrovica court building, which was worked by a group of Serb demonstrators.
De Marnhac said UNMIK is aimed at killing the Kosovo Serb crowd, who attacked UNMIK police.
"It is clear that UNMIK and KFOR soldiers have been removed," he said.
And we will not tolerate it. "
On Monday, three officials said the violence were not planned.
Authorities criticised Serbia, saying authorities in Belgrade did not use the influence of the Mitrovica court to avoid untouch from UNMIK &aposs authority, such as the labour.
Rossin said the Serbian government "has all of the political leaders in northern Kosovo and used a decisive influence".
"We have nothing that we can interpret this equal violence as a clear and clear condemn by Belgrade officials," he added.
Rossin also repeated how Kosovo Serbs have achieved the court building on Friday.
He said that the police in the town should be able to do with the police, because Kosovo ranks a number of demonstrators spread, citing the preliminary front of women and children.
"We cannot harm women and children.
We are very extremely wrong to the preliminary phases of women and children, but these jobs are such, "he said.
Authorities also responded to Serbian Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic of accusations that UNMIK is moving.
Samardzic, who was in Kosovo during the labour, said there was a "prency agreement" on no way to move forward until he arrived in Mitrovica to make a peaceful market.
"Despite this violence, they have carried out the operation and caused the clashes in the street of the crowd," Samardzic said.
Rossin said there is no agreement and that Samardzic has made it clear that UNMIK would take action "at a moment" that he will elect them.
The operation is necessary because Kosovo Serbs plan to attack other UN facilities, he said.

Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor and Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor signed an agreement on Wednesday (November 4th) in Stockholm, expected to end an agreement between the two countries on the sea border.
The decision was welcomed by the EU, the European Commission and the United States.
According to the agreement, the problem that has been an obstacle to bilateral relations between Zagreb and Ljubljana since the two countries' declaration of independence in 1991 will be resolved through international arbitration and commitment.
The agreement was violence last year when Slovenia used its EU member status, blocking Croatia &aposs EU accession talks.
Croatia now hopes to complete negotiations by the end of next year and join the EU in 2011.
"Today we are not only open a new page, but we have already opened a new book," Kosor said. "I hope that the agreement, which has been signed today, will not support our neighbours in Southeast Europe."
Pahor said the signing of a mutual confidence and respect between him and Kosor.
The agreement also signed Swedish Prime Minister Florik Reinfeldt, as his country holds the rotating EU presidency.
The Croatian parliament signed the agreement Monday, stressing that the international arbitration has not been a judiciary on the outcome of the international arbitration.
"We have not been possible to know that in the past 18 years, but we are now going to become successful," said Pahor.
"We are in a situation that both politicians and both countries will be able to see a common atmosphere that will bring us stability, or only the differences between the two countries' views will focus on them.
This is a conflict and unstable situation, "he said.
For now, it seems to be stable.
However, the public in both sides of the border fear that "everyone" is not a situation: 87% of Slovenia, for example, fear that the agreement is more seriously serving Croatian interests.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn celebrated all sides as "a historic agreement".
"This is the most European path to resolving the disagreements," Rehn said. "I call on both countries to continue without no delay, and I hope that Croatia will complete the latest milestone of its negotiations, which has reached the final scene."
Sanader Urges the EU to Still Croatian Membership Talks
Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader said his country should be given the date for the start of EU membership talks.
Last week, EU leaders are expected to announce that negotiations could begin in the spring of 2005, if Zagreb co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal.
(EurActiv - 15 / 12 / 04; AFP, EUobserver, HINA, Radio B92 - 14 / 12 / 04; VOA, Irish Examiner, The Scotsman, Deutsche Welle, HINA - 13 / 12 / 04)

Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader called on Tuesday (December 14th) to EU leaders to determine the date of Zagreb to start accession talks with the Union without new conditions.
His call came ahead of a two-day EU summit, which will meet in Brussels on Thursday, and the leaders of the 25 member states are expected to decide on Croatia &aposs bid to join the Union.
EU foreign ministers met on Monday to review the draft resolution presented by the Dutch EU presidency as preparation for the summit.
Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, Dutch Foreign Minister Bernard Bot said that if it co-operates fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), Croatia would begin its accession talks "around April 2005" if it comes to full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Serbia-Montenegro are committed to full co-operation with the ICTY, the EU said, noting that Croatia &aposs hopes to become a member of the future is to co-operate fully with the ICTY. The UN tribunal has expressed concern over the list of retired General Ante Gotovina -- Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic -- to arrest and extradite the third place in the third place.
However, the foreign ministers said in a draft declaration that the EU leaders are expected to ratify at the upcoming summit, however, there were no details about how Croatia co-operates.
Gotovina has been concerned since June 2001, when the ICTY charged him with his alleged involvement in war crimes, including the murder of at least 150 Krajina Serbs in 1995.
UN chief prosecutor Carla del Ponte described Gotovina last month as "the latest obstacle to Croatia &aposs co-operation with the ICTY".
Del Ponte insisted that Gotovina was seen in Croatia, and that the fugitive is protected by a well-organised support network, which is also on state structures.
Officials in Zagreb, who argued that Gotovina has fought from the country, promised that he would be arrested in place.
"We have to have the Gotovina case to resolve the indictment in The Hague," Sanader told the AFP on Tuesday, stressing the government 'determination to fulfil its obligations to the ICTY.
Croatia could prove full co-operation with the ICTY and is expected to join the EU in 2008 or 2009 if it can start accession talks with the EU.
Meanwhile, the Croatian National Security Council held a closed meeting Tuesday with Sanader and President Stipe Mesic.
The meeting included international co-operation with the ICTY and international co-operation with the secret services, the Croatian news agency HINA reported.

Serbia-Montenegro President Svetozar Marovic recently cautioned that Belgrade has not threatened the stability of the state union, which does not co-operate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The state union of Serbia has also jeopardised its prospects for EU membership, Marovic said, rather than fulfilling its obligations to The Hague.
"The European future of Serbia-Montenegro, as well as the chances of the joint state, is dangerous," Marovic said, accusing that the responsibility is the "major" political forces in Serbia.
EU security chief Javier Solana, who informed Marovic about the situation in Serbia, attended the idea that some ministerial ministries in the Serbian government have blocked progress.
Solana cautioned that the issue of co-operation is jeopardising Serbia-Montenegro ’ s feasibility study on joining the EU.
On December 10th, Serbia-Montenegro gathered to hold a participation in Europe.
The meeting was attended by Marovic and federal Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic, as well as the presidents of Serbia and Montenegro, prime ministers and other important political figures.
According to Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Miroljub Labus, the council has decided that it would be given a surrender to the generals who are wanted by the ICTY, not for months.
Addressing the meeting as extremely successful, Labus said the atmosphere in the three hours of talks showed that tensions between Belgrade and Podgorica are falling.
Marovic, who visited Brussels on Tuesday (December 14th), assured Solana that both constituent republics should show full determination to fulfil international obligations before March 2005, the final date for a positive response to EU feasibility study.
In response to the question that it does not mean that Serbia has promised to arrest ICTY indictees, Marovic said authorities would "concrete confidence" that their obligations will be fulfilled.
Serbian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, however, has so far defended the indictees to surrender their own willingness and is not clear if the indictees are hiding.
Jovan Simic, an adviser to Serbian President Boris Tadic, doubts that indictees, particularly the serious health problems, will surrender near the fugitives, including Mladen Lukic and Nebojsa Pavkovic.
Tadic, meanwhile, emphasised that co-operation with the ICTY is a precondition for political stability in Serbia and that it would be "the main violation of the citizens".
Draskovic cautioned that the door to EU and NATO membership would remain closed until the indictees are not extradited to The Hague.
If it fulfils its obligations, Serbia is high on its chances to join the Partnership for Peace programme, he said.
Draskovic said the problem of war crimes indictees is an obstacle to Serbia, which is among European countries.
"Europe wants us, and our people are convinced to take part in the EU and become a card.
Europe expects us, but this wait has borders, "he said.

Montenegro -- is a subject to the interim Kosovo border. [File]
While discussions on the issue are under way, Montenegro and Kosovo are planning to negotiate official talks aimed at defining a constructive and legal border.
Authorities have shown a permanent permanent stance, while Montenegrin Foreign Minister Milan Rocen insists that his country is "no challenge to resolve our neighbours".
"There is no open problem on the border with Kosovo," Rocen told parliament on October 27th.
He also acknowledged, however, that there is no full information on the issue.
"I do not want to enter this, and I do not know how I can comment on the public," he said.
At the same time, a paper published by Montenegrin affairs declared that the country would not give up even a square meter of its territory.
The recent incidents increased the level of concern.
According to Kosovo media reports, the controversial Kulla / Kula border zone, near the village of Pec, was found on Montenegro "Hoxha" on the Kosovo side.
In protest, more than 200 Albanian villages closed the main highway to the border crossing.
High Representative Sadri Zeka claimed that about 1,000 hundreds of hundreds of hectares have been contained by Montenegro.
Following the protest, Kosovo and border police were held between the regional and border police and Peja / Pec mayor and Montenegrin border police, according to the Kosovo Telegram Bureau.
The mayor of Rozaje, a small Montenegrin border village near the controversial zone, told Rozaje Vijesti on television that the municipality has exercised its roads in the region and will continue to do so.
"We are now doing this, we will now do it, or no one of the borders, or no territory of one, it is the question of them," Kalac said.
MP Emilo Labudovic, representing Serbs in Montenegro, is not the same idea.
Belgrade-based B92 quoted Labudovic as saying the ethnic Albanians have fled their own village, "they are true and destroying their forests.
"Montenegrin border police do not respond," he said.
Kosovo officials believe the border zone will be relatively easy and short of the process, which has been closed with Macedonia.
The border dispute between Kosovo and Montenegro is not the border dispute, government spokesperson Memli Krasniqi reported on October 27th.
Interior Minister Zenin Pajaziti said this would be a joint governance process on the issue and not expected ".
Pajaziti said he hoped that the border emphasis -- and the start of official diplomatic relations with Montenegro -- would not say the history of this, but hoped it will be soon.
Last month, Montenegrin Human and Regional Rights Minister Ferhat Antona told local media that disciplinary relations are waiting to be established by the end of the year.
All in Kosovo do not agree.
Colonel Kurti, leader of the Vetevendosja (Kenderini) movement, has warned that the two countries will have a problem on the border zone.
In a 35-year document, Kurti says that Yugoslavia, which has been defined by the borders of Kosovo, could be in the 1974 constitution.

Analysts: Mladic Prosecutors' Administration for Srebrenica Information
Analysts believe that some of the recent cases against Ratko Mladic, who was transferred to The Hague in the past few months, could be able to answer some of the key questions about the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
(Blic - 11 / 04 / 05; BBC Monitoring, Fena, Radio B92 - 10 / 04 / 05; AP - 09 / 04 / 05; Reuters, BBC, War and Peace Reporting Institute - 08 / 04 / 05)
According to the Sarajevo daily, fugitive war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic may be hiding in a military facility in the north of Belgrade. [AFP]
About ten years after the July 1995 1995 massacre of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys, at least two questions -- the massacre of the massacre -- is still unresponded.
The Institute for War and Peace Relations (IWPR) said on Friday (April 8th) that the cases against wartime Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic could help help help bring the latest part of the Srebrenica team.
The former Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) Security Chairman Ljubisa Beara, who says Mladic is the right right right, was extradited to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in October 2004.
The six people charged with war crimes over the Srebrenica massacre were transferred to The Hague: former VRS radical officer and former VRS member Vinko Panacic, Drago and Milorad Trabic, three former members of the Zvornik Tugury, Zvornik Top.
Both -- former VRS staff officer Radivoje Miletic and former military police General Ljubomir Borovcanin -- are on the ICTY.
The Serbian government said on Friday that the VRS will be transferred to The Hague this week by former security commander Vujadin Popovic, former security commander of the Drina College.
Beara, Panduvic, Nikolic and Popovic were charged with co-operation in genocide or genocide, as well as other war crimes against them.
He was charged with co-operation in genocide.
In addition to Gvero and Miletic, four counts of crimes against humanity and a violation of the laws and customs of war.
Beara and Gvero said they are convinced against all charges against them, while they used the rights of the UN judges to postpone their first stalemate on 30 days.
Dr. Jan Wilig, a senior professor at King 'College university in London, told the IWPR that Borovo and Beara could be a special importance of transfer to The Hague.
At the same time, Honig, a author of the book "Srebrenica: War Crimes War", said that "these were the key players that have linked between the normal military units of the VRS and Mladic, as well as former Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic."
The Sarajevo newspaper Dnevni Avaz reported on Saturday that Mladic is currently a military facility in Pancevo, northeastern Belgrade.
Zanlin said that after Montenegro was hiding in the Niksic region, Montenegro has come closely.
According to the report, three people, including a active military officer.
According to the same network, Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic has caused criticism of Serbian intelligence service last week against Pancevo, who was charged with protecting Mladic.
The Republika Srpska, the Serb side of Serbia and BiH, which has been part of the Srebrenica massacre, described as the worst fect since World War II. The Serbian leadership in Serbia and BiH, is increasingly under pressure to capture the fugitive.
New Cyprus peace talks

"Following the time, we should end our citizens' families and we must reunify our country," Cypriot President Demetris Christofias told reporters after a meeting. [Getty Images]
Cypriot President Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat began a new round of peacekeeping talks Wednesday (September 3rd), hoping the new process would end a 34-year agreement between ethnic communities.
"After the time we have to end our people and we must reunify our country," said Christofias, head of the UN Special Representative to Cyprus Thae-Brook Zeroun, who was head of a meeting in Nicosia.
The talks were attended by former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who has served as UN special envoy for Cyprus since July.
Talat, the top deputy, was optimistic about the final outcome of the talks.
"This historic day is a beautiful day," Reuters quoted Ozdil Nami as saying. "Both leaders will send a message that they are willing to the world to compromise."
The latest initiative to resolve the issue ended in April 2004, when Greek Cypriot voters rejected the reunification plan, drafted by UN support.
The majority of Turkish Cypriots voted in the proposal, but only the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot part of the island on 1 May the same year.
The prospects for the ongoing peacekeeping process were restored earlier this year, after Christofias won the second round of presidential elections, promising no effort to end the island 'division.
He and Talat agreed on March 21st to start preparations for new direct talks.
According to the agreement, six working groups and seven technical committees were established in April to determine details of a reunification agreement before the UN sponsored peacekeeping talks began.
Following several meetings aimed at assessing the progress made by the Committee, Christofias and Talat said the start of new talks on 3 September.
In his opening Wednesday, Christofias said any solution should be based on the principles approved by him and Talat in the previous meetings.
"We need to have a single sovereign sovereignty, citizens and international personal diversification, as the political diversification of the Security Council decisions were defined by the Security Council decisions," the Greek Cypriot leader said.
A deal, Christofias added, would need to be approved by the people in separate referendum, in order to preserve the authority of the process "and to ensure that the outcome is a solution for Cyprus and to ensure that the outcome of the Greek Cypriots would be a solution."
During a meeting Wednesday, actual talks will begin on September 11th.
The talks will focus on a reunification of EU issues, economic, health and environmental reunification.
Security, property rights and territory are expected to be among the issues.
A solution to the Cyprus issue will mean the end of international isolation on Turkish Cypriots, which creates a fifth of about 800,000 people of the island.
Although the talks have not been determined for the talks, Talat said he hoped to reach an agreement by the end of this year.
The two leaders, expected to meet at least a week during the talks, decided to establish a safe telephone line for the process, which has direct telephone connections.
Downer praised the two sides' determination to overcome problems over the past few months, and praise their commitment to resolving a solution, warning potential challenges and uncertainty in the coming months.

Mitrovica: interim solution, long-term problem
NATO is still difficult to solve the border crisis, but the solution of the golden problems is still difficult.

With NATO peacekeeping forces take over control of controversial border checkpoints, the crisis in the north of Kosovo has been resolved.
However, experts suggest that long-term problems are continued and Belgrade and Pristina are not a strong signal that they can reach an agreement.
In an interview with the German media recently, KFOR commander said the lack of the rule of law is a factor that contributes to the crisis in the north of Kosovo.
In addition to the ethnic Albanians, many multiethnic criminal groups from Serbs are allowed to be convicted in the region.
"The fact that Israel is a criminal or crime, it is important to protect the force for these structures.
"Those who have the right to really agree in the north today," he said.
And, in the north, the peacekeeping population has received some of the reputation. "
While representatives from Belgrade sent to Belgrade, KFOR and KFOR have reached an agreement on removing barricades and the way of the free movement of movement, analysts say the agreement is only a provisional measure.
"The region can bring the issue, but there is no solution to the political question in the north," political commentator Fatlum Sadiku told SETimes.
Analysts say a long-term solution can only be achieved through a dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.
"The dialogue is a challenge and no one has the opportunity to avoid this process," said Ramadan Ilai, executive director of the IL Movement in Pristina. "However, dialogue between Kosovo and Pristina has never been done so far.
Belgrade and Pristina, however, are sold to efforts, as well as Pristina has a subject to the future of northern Kosovo, the Serb population.
The Kosovo government continues to support them in Belgrade, which has said local Serb communities would oppose such a plan and not recognise Kosovo as an independent state.
According to Ilaz, the long-term hopes for the north is submitted to the Ahtisaari Plan.
The plan proves that the plan is sustainable solution, because Serbs in southern Kosovo can live with them, he says.
"This plan was successful in the integration and development of the Serb community living in the south and development of the Serb community in the development of Strpce, Gracanica and other municipalities that accept the plan," he said.
Sadiku, meanwhile, is confident that the north "will take place when the rule of law in the region is built and the fight against crime and radical newspapers".
Both Serbia aims to fulfil its final EU membership, while Brussels tried to keep a long-term restoration, urging both sides to return to the negotiating table.
"The EU highlights the need to solve dialogue and solve problems that have been delayed.
The EU wants to see quickly and positive progress on this issue, "he said.
"We hope that all sides will be acceptable, pragmatic and theatre solution will be soon as possible," he added.

"We are contributing to the question of the fact that it is enough," Soldo said. "We know that many of them are in dangerous.
There is no decrease, but excessive excession could lead to a fast decline.
We cannot say there is a lot of things in the Adriatic, because it is not true in the right direction, but we cannot say that it is dangerous.
However, we know that Croatian fears can get less than 90 tonnes annually. "

The latest round of talks on the future of Kosovo is complete and there is no agreement, the international mediator said this week.
"We are convinced that the two sides are not able to reach an agreement on the Kosovo status of Kosovo," EU representative Wolfgang Ischinger said in Belgrade on Monday (December 3rd).
"Our job is closed with a report that we are prepared.
Of course, it does not mean that negotiations on Kosovo will not be done or in other way. "
Ischinger and two other troika members arrived in Belgrade and Pristina to submit the report on December 10th before it submitted to the two sides involved in talks on UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
The report said the details on Belgrade and Pristina 'positions during the 120-day talks were part of their positions.
The document did not bring any proposal on the status issue, but the two sides are unable to reach an agreement.
Troyka seems to be divided over the next potential step in the status process.
As the report presented, US envoy Frank Wisner said the Kosovo issue should "take over" key governments.
Russian representative Alexander Botsan-Karcenko, however, insisted that any decision should be taken by the UN Security Council.
As in the previous round of the status process, the two sides continue to have a subject to the future of Kosovo.
Kosovo Albanians will not be able to raise independence, while Serbs continue to offer "broad autonomy" in various forms.
Serbian Minister of Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic and Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said the talks could continue.
"We believe the negotiations do not end with the troika report.
This is a very important stage and it has been more successful than the stage [by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari], "he said.
Jeremic, meanwhile, has warned Kosovo leaders, who warn that independence could be declared unilateral, if the international agreement cannot be reached.
"The Kosovo status and any changes to international status should be guaranteed by the UN," the Serbian foreign minister said.
Kosovo leaders, however, have denied the possibility of the talks, saying they think the negotiation process is end.
President Fatmir Sejdiu reiterated that independence is unacceptable.
"We think that Ahtisaari will be implemented," Sejdiu said, referring to the plan proposed by the former envoy earlier this year.
The plan calls for the international community to "supervised independence".
Sejdiu said the goal of Kosovo is a modern and democratic state for the majority and minority communities.
Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stressed that KFOR is ready to protect the Serb minority in Kosovo.
At a joint press conference with Croatian President Stipe Mesic, de Hoop Scheffer said the coming weeks will be a sensitive period.
The Kosovo issue will not be resolved, he said.
Mesic called on Kosovo Serbs to participate in Kosovo politics.
He invited Belgrade to open the way for this participation.

Following a visit to Kosovo on Friday (June 24th), UN Secretary-General for Human Rights (IDP) said the situation in the province seems to be improved, but the number of minority returns have been very low.
During a three-day visit to Kosovo, Walter Kalin was said to drop in the number of ethnic incidents for a few months.
However, the IDP and returns are still concerned about their own security.
One of the reasons for the demonstration is the low level.
Other major problems, according to the UN representative, have no restriction of freedom, employment opportunities and lack of insufficient resources.
"The most productive products are that many IDP has not been granted enough money for the return of these people and in other areas," a statement issued by the UN Cenevic Foundation (UNOG) quoted Kalin as saying in a statement.
Furthermore, he expressed concern that none of the IDP had no clear responsibility for the IDP, as a result, noting that the authorities in Kosovo are "largely violated", he said, stressing that the authorities "of the activities of Kosovo, not in particular, but also for refugees."
"This is particularly applied for the Roma, Azerbi and Egyptian IDP, which feels themselves from the two main ethnic communities in Kosovo," the UNOG said in a statement.
The international community also urged the international community to move forward to rescue the Roma population, which has been discovered in the cameras in northern Mitrovica.
"This is an urgent situation," Kalin said. "If it does not take action, the right to protect the health and physical aspects of children who were discovered will be violated."
Earlier this month, the BBC and International Relations Organisation (RI) invited hundreds of Roma living in the refugee cameras, near the rest of a building in Mitrovica.
Although it is no longer used, the region is likely to be discovered with the high levels.
The UNHCR Agency reported that in 1999, the Roma, Open and Egyptian IDP, who fled their homes in southern Mitrovica, was established as an interim asylum seekers.
In the first round, however, there are no longer than 90 days in the book clubs, but there were no other here.
Zitkovac, one of the cameras in the region, is said to be one of the most effective effects.
A few hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of metres near the former nurses, the BBC reported.
According to WHO, who described the situation as a environmental disaster, at least one children were killed.
"The new birth is the most defendant against children, growth and developments in the first phase of their development," the RI report said. "The discovery of the institution is impressive and permanent consequences on the health and quality consequences.
According to the WHO reports, the most important and returns are on the IHO levels. "
UNMIK officials told the BBC earlier this month that the Roma population has offered interim housing in less pollution areas, but rejected them.

Several months after controversial debate over the construction of a license, Baia Mare, a city of 200,000 people in the northwest of the country, has been fired.
Municipal officials say more than 2,000 Roma who live in front of the deeper are planning to change their places.
Apart from the city, the Roma will carry social consultations that have not been formed on the coast of the Craica River.
However, local NGOs and other institutions have criticised the municipal plan.
International Affairs Organisation and other organisations are concerned that the move is discrimination.
The US Embassy in Bucharest also questioned the move.
"The destroyed Roma mafia did not tell the residents of the Roma mafia, and municipal officials have announced their intention to collect those people without the health or embassies," the Embassy said in a press release.
Marian Mandache, head of the Roma NGO Criss' Roman NGO, says that five different Roma communities will result in the consequences of the communities as a single major problem.
"These are a risk of conflict between them," Mandache told SETimes, adding that the group is under way to residents of the plan, mayor and other city officials.
"We want to consult the people to be serious, to the dismantling of these communities with the city and to change the rest of the future social circumstances planned to the Roma," Mandache said. "At the moment, the water supplies station and the former fall of the fall," he said.
As an alternative, the NGO suggested that Roma will be built with a new mafia in which they live.
"If there is a lot from the city, there is no use of the existing architecture that will be discovered after they were destroyed?" Mandache asked.
Mayor Catalin Chereches, however, does not leave the current plan.
"Of course we talked with them, everything was done," Chereches told SETimes.
We have continued this plan for three months and we speak with each Roma and the local Roma organisation, "he said, insisting that the US embassy insisted that the NGOs are wrong.
"There is a poverty poverty that people live in about 17 years without water, water, electricity or central centre," Checes said. "How do you want them to continue to live in the same circumstances?"
"We are doing the laws and we are doing this society," he said.
The new mafia will be built in a strategic position, he added.

The biggest economy in the eurozone will be allowed to continue its participation in rescue operations to members who live the debt issue, in line with the German constitutional court on Wednesday.

"The euro is a guarantor of a united Europe," Merkel said. "If the euro fall, Europe is fall. [Reuters]
German 'highest court decided on Wednesday (September 7th) that the country is legal to participate in the Eurozone bailout loans last year, rejecting cases against Berlin to block the emergency loan package of members of the 17-nation zone.
The ruling at the Federal Constitutional Court came in response to allegations that Germany 'decision to join the European Stabilisation and Association Agreement (EFSF), both in the 110 billion-euro bailout package for both Greece and Greece, is in accordance with the law.
The court in the southern city of Karlshe brought the government to the budget committee for approval before the parliament decided to provide emergency loans to the eurozone countries in the future to ensure other financial guarantees.
Judge Andreas Vosardzle, the second head of the Constitutional court, said it is "a decision that is very aware".
"This decision should not be interpreted as a constitutional bottom that has been given to rescue measures in the future," he stressed.
Observers also said the court 'decision would prevent the discrimination of joint euro bonds, including Belgium and Luxembourg, as a destabilisation of several countries in the eurozone.
While the possibility of reaching the crisis in the Eurozone to make further complicated efforts, the court welcomed the decision by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Addressing lawmakers at the budget talks earlier Wednesday, Merkel said the court decision was a concept of the government 'commitment to the 17-nation eurozone, with the individual responsibility of member states.
In his defence, he also stressed that his importance was not limited, but not only a currency that is shared by the common currency members.
"The euro is a guarantor of a united Europe," he said. "If the euro fall, Europe is fall."
British Financial Times quoted Merkel as saying that countries used a joint unit have not fought with any time.
The German constitutional court also welcomed the decision by the European Commission (EC), which allows Berlin to participate in rescue operations in the future, including the second bailout package for Greece, approved by Eurozone leaders in July.
The EU "executive executive arrangement in Brussels" has expressed satisfaction with the decision of the constitution ", said EC spokesman Pia Ahrenchen.
He added that the move "has an important impact on the capacity of the Union and its members to overcome the debt crisis affected by certain member states".
He also voiced confidence that the EC "protects the German democracy institutions," effectively and determined movement ".
Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos announced a emergency privatisation plan on Tuesday, saying the government would speed up public sector and labour market reforms to reduce public spending.
Turkish new earthquake strategy
Turkey, which includes some of the most active pillars of the world, has been concerned with preventive preparation for earthquake and the rise of the public.
By Mope Tokyay for Southeast European Times in Istanbul -- 08 / 09 / 11

Since 1950, around 32,000 people have lost their lives in earthquake.
The most female was Marmara Deearthquake in August 17th 1999, when the Richter square was 7.4, and about 17,000 people were killed in the earthquake, 600,000 people were injured.
In the 12th anniversary of the earthquake, the government announced the national earthquake strategy and action plan.
"Our mechanism goal is to reduce the economic, social, environmental damage and losses or effectively," said Prime Minister Besir Atalay, who announced the plan.
The new earthquake strategy is the basis of work under the co-ordination of the Deearthquake Administration Council, which is drafted by a golden commission in parliament, and the Strategy contains plans for 13 different institutions.
The government also discussed NGOs and academics in the preparation process.
Intelligence engineering and the EC Party MP Professor Pelin Gunden Baku emphasised the importance of co-operation between political parties, universities, architecture and NGO representatives.
"Of course, there must be an extraordinary issues, such as earthquake and city transformation, to be taken into a political understanding," Bakoyannis said.
Plan has seven basic targets, 29 strategies and 87 actions.
In this framework, earthquake resistance, safety, preparation and more sustainable new life environments are planned.
Plan also envisions the establishment of the early warning systems for monitoring operations and advance.
As part of the new plan, the establishment of an unsustainable communication system is among the targets.
Plan also envisions strengthening both the critical infrastructure facilities and fundamental public buildings.
Nevertheless, the Intelligence Company criticised the plan, criticising the strengthening of buildings, noting that structural structures do not have to strengthen financially and rebuild reconstruction.
Another criticism of the experts' plans is only on the issue of public buildings, while private guests are removed from the door, which means that a significant part of the population is under the earthquake.
Only 90% of the buildings in Istanbul are estimated that the earthquake of the buildings is not based on the earthquake, while nearly 20-25 years are needed for strengthening all buildings in the city.
Meanwhile, the plan aims to focus on the creation of natural disasters and emergency measures, including first and medium-school institutions, and the opening of sports programmes on the agenda of natural disaster management.
Plan does not have the need to protect historical and cultural heritage from the earthquake effects.
"This plan is an extraordinary measures that need to be taken in our country in the danger of earthquake, the long-term perspective of specialised perspectives, the internal affairs, monopoly and profile decisions, and to recognise each other as independent projects, as well as to complete each other."
At the same time, the plan is not exercised by all experts, and the former head of the Intelligence Company, Professor Muzparer Tuntagle, is one of them.
This plan does not bring a different approach from the speculation so far, and the majority of the scientific circumstances have been on scientific environment for years, "he said." All of the issue is the split of active actions. "

Kosovo has acknowledged the euro as a currency to gain financial security about ten years ago. In 2002, the province returned from Germany in 2002, hoping to prevent the currency unit from the currency.
Nevertheless, Kosovo faces a possible crisis with 17 other countries that use the euro?
Although the Kosovo Central Bank argues it has made financial stability to the euro, Pristina banking expert Lirifa Hasani highlights that stability and European integration with the financial sector.
"The transition from Germany is not easy to the euro.
The prices have been increased -- even today -- it is a stake in financial stability, but helped Kosovo become part of a greater region that uses the same currency, "he said.
He believes the crisis in the Eurozone will not affect Kosovo.
"Kosovo is based on the transparency of Germany, and so far this two countries have no problem in financial stability," he said.
Rudina Heroi-Puka, of the GEP Institute for Studies, agrees that the incidents in Germany will be a certain factors in Kosovo.
"We have to be linked to the Eurozone crisis in Germany, so that a crisis in the centre will reflect us," Heroi-Puka told SETimes.
Lumir Abdushiu, director of the RINVEST Institute, says Kosovo is more risk as a result of the government ’ s public property administration.
"I see an internal financial crisis that has come from the crisis in Europe, the government has caused excessive expenditures and potential debt to the country.
"It is a concern among the country and that the only hope of the country is to be an emergency impression of the PTK (Kosovo) privatisation," he said.
Abkshiku says privatisation will increase these risks when it is expected to happen this year.
"This could jeopardise the economic stability of the country and its relations with the IMF," he said.
Heroi-Puka warns that a financial crisis in developing countries, such as Kosovo, will be more substantial effects.
"If such a crisis, the country is becoming more difficult economic situation than other developed countries … unemployment and poverty is reflected in a reduction of prices and purchase power," he said.
He says Kosovo is not stable trade relations with the EU, so that the crisis in the eurozone will not affect the crisis.
"Kosovo is not a country that exports, therefore any change in the value of his position … it allows the country to facilitate trade in the markets that are not in the eurozone," Abshiku said.
However, European countries can affect their donations, if they can provide less assistance due to their domestic financial situation.

The Danube River has offered two companies for designation and construction of the second nuclear power plant (NES) in the Bulgarian town of Belene, about 250 km northeast of Sofia.
The company, which won the project, expected to cost around 2 billion euros, must be declared by August 1st.
The Czech Skoda Alliance discovered 29 metal consortium, which was close to half tonnes of tonnes in Sofia on Wednesday (February 1st), while Russian Atomstroyexport congratulated three tonnes of documents, including three tonnes of documents.

As the leader of the Republican People 'Party (CHP) in Turkey, the current party leader Denmark Baykal called for an extraordinary congress on January 29th.
Baykal 'call came after the CHP disciplinary board decided to export corruption allegations against the top rival, Mustafa House, who was in the competition against 7 of the vote.
The move was seen as the latest declaration of bridge between the Turkish main opposition party CHP members in the recent elections.
Baykal targeted criticism because his party was in the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which won a clear victory in the March 28th local elections.
The party was only 18 per cent of the elections.
According to many analysts, the ongoing party has shown that the organisation is in the process of transforming a more efficient Social Democrat party.
Some, however, fear that the party is disbanded.
So far, many different opponents have been revealed by supporting a separate candidate.
In addition to Baykal and Sartol, the two parties -- Hurr Golden and Zapital Livanda -- are competing for president.
The two main candidates have been backing from around the country, while Baykal 'opponents seek to unify.
The only problem of the CHP is not internal divisions.
Two members of the Supreme Disciplinary Council, Cafer Durres and Enrich Baba, are under investigation because of bribery claims in judges.
These members will not vote in the party congress.
Among the political observers, the overall chances of the CHP should be able to regain the pace of the pace, or that change should be changed.
Most say the party is not able to respond to current problems such as economic instability, political corruption, unemployment and inefficient distribution of the public.
In addition, analysts say the CHP has been harmful to domestic issues instead of international problems.
However, the AKP &aposs international stance, EU membership and the overall external relations are also important for Turkey.

This type of accession could be held in Haiti, the head of the country &aposs peacekeeping operations centre, according to Colonel Petar Djordov.
He said authorities signed a UN decision to establish a 400-strong exhibition that could receive possible role in the peacekeeping operation in Haiti.

Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said on Wednesday (January 19th) that a Croatian-Slovenian joint committee, who has reviewed bilateral relations, could be formed.
The ongoing disagreements between Ljubljana and Zagreb should not lead to relations between the two countries or Croatia 'EU bid, he stressed.
Slovenia and Croatia have been disagreements since Slovenia declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991.
The bridge on the Istrian injured has caused some border incidents and continues to be one of the most critical points in bilateral relations.
Slovenia is a small card in the southeastern border with Croatia.
The two countries signed the access agreement in 2001, but Croatia has not yet approved it.
In Slovenia, however, the two countries' joint priority is the Kruso nuclear power plant, and the west of Ljubljanska Bank, also discussed debts with Croatian consultants.
"With Croatia, there are a number of problems that Slovenia can solve only within the EU," Rupel said at a press conference in Zagreb on Wednesday. "Therefore, I think that Croatia is approaching the EU as soon as possible."
Slovenia joined the EU on 1 May 2004, along with nine other Central and Eastern European countries, and was the first former Yugoslav republics adopted by the bloc.
Croatia, which is expected to begin EU membership talks in March, is expected to receive full membership in 2009.
The latest incident that Croatian border police detained a Slovenian politics in September last year caused a threat to Ljubljana that Zagreb would lose the way for the EU bid.
It was later withdrew.
Citing both countries to seek a solution through dialogue, EU security chief Javier Solana said the door to the EU is open to all Balkan countries.
"We have to learn to resolve the conflict through dialogue and co-operation," Solana said.
Rupel said the proposal to form a joint expert committee to discuss bilateral relations was adopted by Zagreb.
According to the ministry, Slovenian and Croatian prime ministers Janez Jansa and Ivo Sanader are scheduled to hold a separate meeting.
However, Rupel did not provide details about the finding or time.
Zagreb said he wants to take the border issue to international arbitration if it fails to reach a solution through mutual dialogue.
BiH obstacles await for initiative
The high unemployment rate between obstacles in Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely the lack of legal framework.

The obstacles in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) are facing various challenges, as the laws that guarantee employment rights are slowly implemented.
Authorities organised a unemployment study for obstacles last month and proposed several strategies and projects.
Even if this event, however, a mechanism that people who use the repeat seats will not be done.
"Such cases are a type of example of the concept of politicians' stance against obstacles," FBiH 'Association of FBiH Secretary-General Enka Beslija told SETimes.
According to data, there are no official figure on unofficial obstacles -- Republika Srpska (RS) has a total of 350,000 obstacles, including 250,000 in the FBiH.
The unemployment rate between the countries is around 85%.
The FBiH parliament has passed five years to implement the Convention of the Mesleki Rehabilitation, Education and Intelligence, and a year.
The law was passed in early 2010 and parliament promised to form a special fund for the continuation of the law, which took place in April 2011.
Both the law and the funds have been passed in RS in 2005.
Since then, 1,000 obstacles have been found.
However, such a state level is not a law or fon.
The law was part of the obligations BiH has a country that has signed the UN English Rights Progress.
The law envisions at least 39 workers at least 39 employees in all public institutions and enterprises by 2013, and the number will be to 16.
The average salary in FBiH -- 423 euros in 2011 -- is envisioned by 25% of the average monthly salary in FBiH -- unless it does not cover the disabled.
The two sides, creating BiH, are 532,000 euros annually to support the employment of obstacles, and the entity government proposes a boycott of the year, which has been blocked.
According to Beslija, however, these actions have not been made.
"We have to create a long-term positive atmosphere for employment," he said.
Several organisations, representing the investors, have decided to create companies and make their own members, take measures to take place their own image.
The Librague company, founded by the Sarajevo Association of Health and Information, is operating in the field of the Libyan company, established in 1996.
The company has only provided obstacles with its own members.
"We have been almost doubt over a few times, but we have stopped in a way with foreign organisations and embassies," Libyan Director Jasminka Karahasanovic told SETimes.
"In the time, the FBiH government has passed the law on obstacles six years ago, it would be strong and its own interests, and we would give more jobs.
However, until the law is passed, only the authorities live in good intention and dependence on foreign donations, "he added.
Mirza Jasarevic of the NGO Centre for Reconstruction and Support says the FBiH could be employed and half of the obstacles in the country, which have spent social prosperity since the end of the armed conflict.
"They are the biggest prosperity category and a large part of the electoral book," Jasarevic told SETimes.

Serbia-Montenegro has two key issues in front of Euro-Atlantic integration.
One is that the UN cannot co-operate fully with war crimes and indictees -- particularly Bosnian Serb wartime leader Ratko Mladic -- are still at large.
The second case was the case that the country has begun ten NATO countries due to its move in 1999.
The case was opened by the International Court of Justice in The Hague by Slobodan Milosevic.
Serbia-Montenegro Foreign Minister Vuk Draskovic said the Council of Ministers would propose the reduction of charges.
European Commission Ambassador to Serbia-Montenegro Geoffrey Bartet said the reduction of the charges would increase the country &aposs chances for joining the EU.
"It is necessary to deal with the past on its path to Europe," he said.
Belgrade has proposed a reduction of the case, while NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has suggested that he had made during a visit to Serbia-Montenegro on July 19th.
Officials in Brussels are positive.
The proposal was supported by the Democratic Party (DS), led by Serbian President Boris Tadic.
The DS argues that everything possible to facilitate EU and NATO membership in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme as soon as possible.
"If these specific accusations do not mean the withdrawal of these specific crimes, we must take this step because our country is not a condition for the international community," the DS said in a statement.
However, the most effective party in the Serbian government -- the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS), headed by Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, argues that Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia should also be reduced.
"We think the same problem should be seen in all cases, because they are part of the problem," a DSS official said.
As expected, the Serbian Radical Party and the Socialists of Milosevic have criticised the initiative of Draskovic.
Political analysts warn that the withdrawal of the charges is not the most important issue that affects Serbia-Montenegro 'prospects for joining the PfP programme.
The main demand of the international community is Mladic 'arrest and co-operation with the UN tribunal, experts noted.
The withdrawal of the case will be a more convinced signal that NATO wants to join the Alliance.
Serbian media analysts say the accusations will have to reduce or drop, as it is unreasonable to open a system that is trying to be part.

Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski met with opposition leader Ali Ahmeti last week after the ongoing political crisis in almost two months.
The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) left parliament in January, when parliament did not comply with the Badinter front of the decision.
According to the article, decisions concerning minorities have been taken, while at least three of the Macedonian minority members in parliament have to vote.
The DUI has sparked a lack of political dialogue and a lack of political dialogue, and has affected laws needed for EU and NATO membership.
Before the meeting, the United States encouraged NATO and the EU and the ruling parties to discuss the problems.
Following a bitter shopping, the dialogue continued.
Gruevski discussed political issues for Ahmeti and his equipment for more than six hours.
Ahmeti suggested that the government will be elected by Badinter, a list of requirements, including the adoption of laws aimed at finding the status and social problems of former National Liberation Army members.
Gruevski, however, dismissed the two proposals.
This would mean Macedonia to change the state order, he said.
"In the world, such a government has no other example," he said.
Gruevski encouraged the DUI to return to politics, and asked the government to support projects on the prosecution and information society, laws and information society, parliament direction and constitutional amendments.
At the end of the meeting, Badinter did not reach an agreement on preparing a list of laws that will be made, according to the Badinter.
A task group of representatives of the two parties to submit a list will be created and will be part of the parliamentary assembly.
Agron Bau, a member of the DUI delegation, said the dialogue is not a model for dialogue.
The tasks' groups should discuss all issues, because the dialogue will not continue without a compromise, he said.
The meeting was initially opposed, but representatives of foreign embassies participated in the DUI as a precondition for the DUI.
The US embassy issued a joint press release after the meeting of EU, NATO and the OSCE missions, saying it is a very important step towards building confidence among the parties.
"We are urging all parties to continue these efforts and work in the spirit of reconciliation.
This is a condition for the reform process and the continuation of state institutions, "the statement said.
However, the DUI said he would wait to see "concrete results" before parliament returns.

Muhamet Cakaj, 19, was killed by other students at the Sami Frashi Lister in Pristina, but the last of several key incidents that have taken a preliminary plan for violence in Kosovo schools.
The problem has led to public debate.
"This is the lack of security for students in schools and environmental facilities.
Before all, it is a demonstration that the education and security institutions have not been able to deal with this serious problem, "he said.
The figures also supported the concerns of the INPO: The first explosion of 2011 was more than 210 cases, which were conceived by most students.
This is worse by 2010, when the police were injured 37 networks, 36 injured damaged damage, 15 genocide and uncertain reasons, according to police data.
Experts are trying to announce the increase in violence, while Kosovo UNICEF said "The work in Kosovo shows that violence is a high risk for the development of children due to poverty and other factors," Aferdita Spahiu of Kosovo said.
In addition to inter-ethnic violence, the violence launched by young people against students have also made a statement.
The 18-year-old student Shpace, 18, says teachers have learned from students without any reason, and that they were simply attacking them.

In addition, a student arrived in a mobile phone, while teachers were learning and they were sold, "he said.
Pristina retired teacher Recep Tayyip Gashi acknowledges that teachers are applied to students, while they are at least the border.
"Several teachers were used to use [their] positions] as a way to demonstrate children from the class, but this is not true," Gashi said.
However, he said, many still face war traffic and poverty, nor the government could be difficult for students because they do not want to solve these problems.
"In the newspapers, the papers are difficult to find a job with a good education, and this is on the street," Gashi said.
Pristina teacher Agron Switzerland is difficult to build teachers today because students are repeatedly disappointed and extremely cabinet, but acknowledges the incidents in recent years.
"I remind that the children are always wrong, I remind the years of a school implementation, but this is 90% different.
And it is not completely unfair, and those who continue to implement this practice are always abandoned or putting them, "he said.
In an effort to resolve the issue, the Kosovo Education Ministry said it is working with schools and society to determine the dangers of physical abuse and consequences.
However, the ministry said, the part of the families, schools and society is unable.
"I call on the parents and other responsible institutions of the country, but also on all communities to influence their children every day to prevent violence in schools and lives," Education Minister Rama Buja told SETimes.

"If you receive a quality for asylum seekers, you see it more from abroad," Jengo said.
Albanians, such as Turkey, are not able to go to countries, but preferred to Croatia, Spain and Greece because of the visa liberalisation.
Jorgoni acknowledges that tourism is not aware of "exports" and "imports", but acknowledges that the most important problems in Albania are lack of infrastructure, such as tourism documents.
"So far, a free tourism has been made," Jorgoni said, adding that the government is now working to ensure it.
Tourism investments are also under way.
According to Jorgoni, a new bill will encourage tourism investments "and the Ministry of Tourism and Culture will become a single functioning agency and tourism manager."

"Therefore, we do not recognise our holidays, and in the places where we are in accordance with the quality of services and the amount of payments," Beko said.

According to the latest report by Freedom House, Montenegro has not strengthened civil freedom during 2006, and there was some democracy in the country.
In particular, the NGO pointed out the fight against corruption, the government has excessive influence on the state television and the confidence in the judiciary.
Freedom House said Montenegrin authorities are insufficient in the fight against corruption and that parliament does not strengthen laws related to the conflict.
The organisation said the long-standing court procedures, as well as the confidence in corruption and organised crime cases.
According to Freedom House, Montenegrin state television continues to reflect a pro-government stance, instead of serving as an unbiased information resources.
The laws on NGOs are also assessed and are one of the most liberal laws in the region, the report said.
However, the organisation points out that the laws are being used by tightening.
"There are more than 3600 NGOs, and most of them are operating or are used as parallel by small businesses such as restaurants, services or foreign language schools," the Freedom House said. "Only 200 NGOs are said to be said to have a NGO representative.
These are still the public or the government do not respect the census. "
However, the report also voiced confidence that the pace of reforms is likely to be overcome this year, despite many progress.
Freedom House says the public is demanding, and it is necessary for EU membership.
"People are ready to move forward and there is a great expectation of political leaders," the organisation said. "The stagnation in 2006 will not continue, because Montenegro wants a change to improve living conditions."
Freedom House has suggested that Montenegro would also be a test of its commitment to fighting corruption, while Montenegro is on the right to join the EU.
"To achieve real progress in this field, the government, the judiciary, police, the prosecution, parliament and the public must work in line with the rule of law," the NGO said.
Montenegro left the former state union with Serbia in May 2006.
Since then, the country has been under way to form an independent state and organise the elections.

The 12 political parties in Macedonia signed a joint co-operation agreement last week with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and the ruling VMRO-DPMNE government.
"Our final goal is to defuse the coalition led by the VMRO-DPMNE," coalition leader Branko Crvenkovski said in Skopje on 1 February.
Crvenkovski, the former Macedonian president, said various political parties have put their differences for the climate in a critical period.
Many parties, named as symbolic, are Crvenkovski 'Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) leader.
The coalition consists of the current allies and former opponents, as well as pressure from extremist and communists.
The only goal of the parties is to transfer the centre-right coalition, which has been in power since the July 2006 parliamentary elections.
Observers pointed out polls that the Gruevski government remains popular among the public, noting that Cephe will reach this goal.
The Liberal Democrats, who have already been criticised by Gruevski, have not joined the Liberal Democrats, who continued their objections to Crvenkovski.
The Democratic Party of Albanians, led by Menduh Thaci, refused to participate.
Ljube Boskovski, 49, is a former interior minister in the ruling government. Boskovski, who was acquitted for war crimes against ethnic Albanians in the village of Ljuboten in 2001, is now a strong opposition to Gruevski.
In a speech to the crowd during the signing of a multiparty agreement, new Alternal leader Djordci Orovlievec said the Gruevski government does not fulfil nothing.
"We do not have domestic investments, no money, we do not have any production, but we have no friendship."
Gruevski said he did not comment on the unfortunately, saying he is not only fear that he lost power.
Analysts pointed out that only a number of voter polls showed the trend of the parties participating in Cephe.
Professor Joand Kekenovski says the effect of the united opposition is more psychological, while politics expert Albert Musliu praised the current government as provocative.

Belgrade and Pristina have recently discussed technical issues related to the cleaning and arrangement of Kosovo in the international conference -- the two agreements have been praised by the country officials and the international community.
However, many bloggers see them as harmful to the interests of Kosovo.
The article agreement envisions that Kosovo is not the worst "Republic of Kosovo" in the international forums, and at the same time the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 and an ICJ decision on the Kosovo declaration of independence.
On the other hand, dissatisfaction has shown after the first challenges in implementing the agreements.
The Serbian and Kosovo teams left regional conference because of the repression of Kosovo.
Kosovo bloggers fought and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, who fought Serbia for Kosovo, accusing the EU of accusing the entity since Belgrade.
"The EU has repeatedly repeatedly reviewed the opinion of the five countries and recognised Kosovo as a result of the 22 EU member states in the past period, and the unilateral stance for Kosovo independence," Belul Bekaj, a professor at the University of Pristina, told SETimes.
The EU has not been delayed in response to the public that the agreement on cleaning was announced and that it is very clear.
"In terms of the use of use in the meetings, the rating of the paper has stopped organisers to decide on the ground," EU spokesman Maja Kocijancic told SETimes.
"I do not know that some of them are accusing the EU, instead of question: What is our representatives who helped Serbia get candidate status?" he said.
But others do not participate.
According to Dielli, the agreements have created all differences that only one entity has allowed to move forward on its path to EU membership.
"In five years, Serbia will go to the EU. After 50 years, we will wait to see how Kosovo will happen."
Inga is completely appointed prime minister.
"Hashim Thaci has made Kosovo its own couple, nor does not want it," he said. "The constitution is changing its constitutional name."
"The EU was in Kosovo after the war, and we see what we are ready to have a state.
There is no single ministerial ministry to investigate corruption in Kosovo, but most of the mayors' mayors have corruption claims and some have been sentenced to prison.
Europe has spread us, "he said.
"While acknowledging the rating, Kosovo has ordered itself as a state of 87," he added.
He participated in the list, saying the government is really beaten to negotiate without the open approval.
"The rating is only one of a series of problems that Serbia is talking with them, and when you are able to participate in negotiations with our own people," he said.
Some bloggers such as Licelpi argue that the agreements are the best to be done under the current conditions.
"What is a better solution for an agreement or a better plan for an agreement?" he asked.
"We received us.
Otherwise, the government is in the EU over 50 years, "he adds.
RS passes controversial referendum law
The Republika Srpska parliament passed a law allowing the BiH entity to hold a referendum on national issues.
Although RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik rejected, concerns that the measure could open the way for a independence referendum.

The Republika Srpska (RS) parliament adopted a law on Wednesday (February 10th) that could open the way for a independence referendum on the entity, which could lead to warnings of the international community.
The amendments to the referendum were adopted after two days of controversial debate in the 83-seat assembly -- the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) -- which was negotiated by RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik.
The new law was adopted with six papers, with 16 votes against 46.
Bosniak members of the RS parliament boycotted the vote, insisting that the bill violated the Dayton Peace Accords and the BiH Constitution.
The law allows the Serbian entity to hold a referendum on national issues, but only a few technical issues, such as the voting procedures and the referendum.
The law does not say whether the referendum can be held, or questions are questioned.
Dodik repeatedly threatened to call for a referendum on RS 'independence, if the entity is in danger of autonomy.
While the prime minister has not been threatened in recent months, the RS parliament has made its decision in December, when High Representative Valentin Inzko refused to extend the mandate of foreign judges and prosecutors working in Bosnian courts.
Dodik denied on Tuesday that the new Reference and the Civil Civil Civilian Law was aimed at facilitating the entity 'secession from BiH or violating the Dayton Accords.
"We will call for a referendum on the support of the Dayton Peace Accord and the decisions that are here," he said.
Dodik dismissed the authority of Inzko, the chief international envoy, Inzko, who has broad comprehensive powers in BiH, including imposing laws and elected officials.
Currently, the RS prime minister, who is currently under investigation by foreign prosecutors, insists that the country has no international presence in the legal system.
Dodik argues that the entity people should decide on all issues.
The law was approved, despite warnings that the international community could make the stability of BiH, even though the international community warns about such issues.
"While the referendum is a legitimate mechanism in accordance with the conditions, it could be easy and even disappointed when it was used to monitor a narrow political agenda," the US Embassy in Sarajevo said on Tuesday. "The United States will accept any concept of a referendum that threaten Bosnia and Herzegovina to sovereignty or territor
The leaders of the Bosnian Serb parties, who support Inzko 'law, warned that the adoption of the referendum would be more monitoring RS from European and world communities.

The political scene of Macedonia has been unprecedented.
All parties have chosen congress and elected new leaders.
In the past year, the ruling VMRO-DPMNE has been extraordinary, especially in the predecessor of Social Democrats in 2000, the coalition of Macedonia, which was established in the predecessor of Social Democrats.
One of the reasons of this situation is a new channel that has raised the number of political parties from 500 to 1,000.
As a result of the amendment, many smaller political groups have to enter the unit of greater groups.
Following the end of the communist regime in Macedonia, the first political party, Democracy Ligi, joined the VMRO-DPMNE, such as the medical Agriculture Party.
Agriculture Party leader Marjan Gorcev was later members of the VMRO-DPMNE, and former Prime Minister Ljubco Dacski served as agriculture minister in the government.
The DRUM party, founded by the VMRO-DPMNE former General Dosta Pavovska, was returned to the party.
In all, eight parties participated in the VMRO-DPMNE.
Small parties are not satisfied with the amendment of the law on political parties.
Gjorge Marjanovic, former leader of the Democracy League and actor of actors, demanded a proposal to the Constitutional Court to revise the changes.

Last month, the court launched a procedure for the parties' justice ministry 'signals in local units and complete losses within 45 days.
The judges expressed concern that the provisions would violate freedom of movement, a constitutional group of political groups.
Meanwhile, the opposition Social Democratic League of Macedonia (SDSM) has found some test because the latest elections were lost.
Former Prime Minister Vlado Buckovski, leader of the party, was exported from the party because of a confidence vote on the confidence.
Following this exports, a congress was held to set the new president.
Radmila Sekerinska, former prime minister in charge of European integration, was the new head of the SDSM.
The option of Sekerinska has made a completely new shift to the party &aposs president.
Now the party is under way the election of the party, which is also seen as part of the efforts to ensure the party.
The ruling VMRO-DPMNE organised a congress, chosen Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski as president.
With the public opinion, the situation is in the 2002 parliamentary elections, as the role has changed.
Today, the ruling party, as it was in 2002, has revealed a strong popular popularity, while the opposition is at large.
However, the ruling VMRO-DPMNE, which won the confidence of 23 per cent of the public, according to the latest research, is the ruling party in 2002 and the Social Democrats, which can win only 8 per cent of voters today.
Political analysts say the incident is normal.
"The votes in the elections are very natural to support the party in a certain time when the economic problems will be resolved," political analyst Merjana Biljalli said.
According to polls, 23 per cent of the population is confident VMRO-DPMNE. [Getty Images]
The government will lose a slow loan, he says, if it does not fulfil its commitments during the election campaign.
Although the SDSM declined, it was the same. Despite the high popular popular popularity in 2002, the government of citizens had not met their expectations for economic improvement and investments.
Sekerinska will have to demonstrate how much effectively affect the Social Democrats on the path to political arrangements.
The latest development of the latest development was destroyed in the Union for Macedonia, which was established after the local elections in 2000.
After 2002, he won a victory and then supported Branko Crvenkovski, a candidate for president in 2004.
The second largest party in the Union for Macedonia was the Liberal Democrats, also a political restructuring process.
A party leader and former Skopje Mayor Risto Penov resigned from his post at the party congress.
After his resignation, Penov took over former Defence Minister Jovan Manasievski.
Manasievski, who declared the congress after the congress was left from the Liberal Democrats' coalition, said the party faces the dangerous threat to the SDSM.
The Liberal Democrats are planning to join the local elections, expected to be held in 2009.
Party: Ethnic Regional Regional Charter in Serbia
The strongest ethnic minority party in Serbia, Vojvodina Hungary, has urged the Alliance of Vojvodina to pressure on the international community to end discrimination.
The first part of the two sectors.
By Dusan Kosanovic for Southeast European Times in Belgrade - 27 / 01 / 04
According to the latest census, ethnic minorities have created more than 30 per cent of the population of Serbia, none of the Serb non-Serb communities will not be a representative in the new parliament.
The House of Hoxha Coalition, the two main ethnic minorities in Serbia, has been creating significant political parties of Hungarians and Bosniaks, failed to overcome the 5 per cent threshold in the December 28th parliamentary elections.
The Serbian electoral code is considered insufficient from international organisations, as the Serbian electoral law gives the security of all ethnic groups via "poor discrimination" and does not protect minority rights.
The pro-European parties in parliament have promised to change the law, saying they are not only Serbs, but to all nationals.
The leader of the Vojvodina Hungarian Alliance (SVM), however, claims that lawmakers will not be seen as representatives of the truth think of their people.
It is a reason for the decrease of election efforts, and a lack of unemployment in the parties.
Some refused to participate in the Hoxha Coalition, but instead the forces of Belgrade "with" Belgrade parties ".
One of them is the Democratic Party of Democratic Party, which has been granted two Bosniaks for support.
According to Salza, the December elections have ended with "three steps" in Belgrade, as Serbia has been moving on its path to Europe, as a result of the ultranationalist Radical Party ".
He also voiced disappointment that the Coalition of the House has achieved poor results in central Serbia and Belgrade.
The party in the north of Vojvodina was second.
"For years, it has been tolerated and will strengthen the ideas that will be affected outside the region, or will be affected by the nationalist ruling Vojvodina people," Kazsa said.
The SVM sent a letter to international organisations, warning that the new political situation could cause a negative stance for minorities.
The SVM head said the Radikal Party is enough to bring a series of incidents in Vojvodina during the election victory.
The SVM is urging the international community to change the election law and pressure on the adoption of amendments proposed by the SVM law on Human and Regional Rights.
The party believes the amendments would create preconditions for a multicultural society.
"If Serbia accepts our culture, we are easy to accept Serbia as the appointment," he said in a letter.

"There is two options: a parliament and a complex future," Ashdown said. "EU membership will be the only future to present BiH with prosperity, security and stability.
You can choose this option.
However, there is no circumstances, but you can choose it. "
The EU is expected to decide next month to allow BiH to start talks on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, considered the first step towards eventual membership in the Union.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said that if BiH politicians agree on a successful reconstruction agreement in line with the EU principles of police, Brussels would be the green light for negotiations.

"It is not a plan to address the issue of constitutional reform," Ashdown said. "There is no attack on RS.
"There is no initiative to pull the cafes," he said, adding that this does not mean the execution of the RS interior ministry.
Ashdown said he would bring better equipment for the fight against crime and benefit such as equal wage for the two sides.
Instead of the consequences of a new poll in RS, Ashdown said that 79 per cent of respondents want to BiH to join the EU, while 51 per cent said they support the establishment of a state-level police service if the country is on the European path.
"Some 59 per cent of the RS citizens are more effective than politicians," he said, adding that the participants "need to do more in the fight against crime," according to 77 per cent of the participants. "According to 77 per cent of the police, he added, the goal of the three EU nations is to do so.

Since Milosevic took over, several laws have been submitted in 2000 by civil society organisations and political parties.
However, none of them were unacceptable because of insufficient political will and the negative assessment of security services.
As a result of pressure from the Democratic Opposition of Serbia, the Democratic Opposition moved forward for a solution and allowed citizens who are suspected to control such a case.
If the suspects are unfair, they were allowed to lose their homes in the secret secret service building.
According to the interior ministry, around 8,000 citizens gave the decision as a result of the government.
After control, however, only 413 people were discovered.
In June 2003, the Serbian Constitutional Court decided that the government decision is inappropriate, and the Constitutional Court ruled that only the decision should be fully proud, instead of the archives.
The bill, which is the most precedent, was drafted by the War Crimes Action Centre.
The proposal sparked highly controversial debate for the right to broadcast persons on security architecture.
Observers opposed the bill say it would threaten the "conspiracy of the service" and would harm potential to state interests.

EU reaffirmed support for Western Balkan countries' integration
EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday to apply for membership in the bloc, leaving some Balkan countries on their targets.
(Euobserver, Wall Street Journal, Irish Times, Emportal, Makfax - 29 / 07 / 09; AFP, Reuters, FT, BBC, Fena, Sweden - 27 / 07 / 09; FT, Fena - 26 / 07 / 09)
The application of Iceland has sparked concerns among some Southeast European countries that aim to join the EU. [Getty Images]
The foreign ministers of the 27-nation bloc reaffirmed their support for Western Balkan countries' EU bid on Monday (July 27th), promising Albania 'application for membership as soon as possible.
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said after talks in Brussels that the EU would "give a new momentum in the Western Balkans".
The comments came after foreign ministers decided to accept the official application for EU membership and send the European Commission (EC) to assess the bloc.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Monday that the North Republic of North is a member of the European Economic Sahin, with about 300,000 people of the population, it means that the country laws are complicated with the EU laws.
He also noted, however, that the application for the Iceland would "be in charge of the rules", instead of the quick accession process.
Analysts believe the EC is likely to launch accession talks with Brussels if it comes to a positive assessment on the application of the Iceland.
According to this scenario, the country could now join the bloc in the second half of 2011.
Several EU foreign ministers, including French Bernard Kouchner and Palestinian Alexander Stubb, pointed out that Iceland is not impossible for economic pressure after last year.
"The Iceland would be a political mistake to the Balkan countries," Kouchner said at a press conference in Brussels.
Analysts warned that the new Iceland could lead to a possible balance between some EU aspirations in the Balkans, which has made progress towards membership in the bloc.
For example, the accession talks that Croatia must be completed by the end of this year have been blocked since December, due to the country &aposs border dispute between Slovenia and Slovenia.
Macedonia has been awaiting for a date to start talks with Brussels since December 2005, when the EU candidate country is accepted.
Greek Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said on Monday that Athens would block Skopje 'start accession talks, continue to continue until the long-standing name dispute between the two countries are resolved.
The stalemate of reforms has been an obstacle to Bosnia and Herzegovina to make progress on its path to European integration.
Serbia must hand over former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic to The Hague war crimes tribunal, as well as the challenges of Kosovo, as well as progress towards membership.
Montenegro submitted an official application for EU membership in December, and was granted to the EC to be reviewed in April.
The same month, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha presented an official application for his country during a visit to Prague.
The EU cautioned that the 28 June parliamentary elections in Albania will not accept it as a fair and free.
Relations: Albania opposes discrimination against nationalism
The minorities in Albania are planning to launch a case at the Constitutional Court to bring the "legitimate" category in legal and census forms, as well as to the constitution.

The ethnic minorities in Albania -- Macedonians, Greeks, Albanians, Roma and Egyptians -- announced that after the Albanian Constitutional Court decided last week to invest in Strasbourg after the European Court of Human Rights, which ended the legal and census.
The court was unable to "legitimate" for the census forms to determine the Albanian population.
The name of the "nationalism" in the eastern borders, including Greeks and Macedonians in the south of Albania, and for the prominent minorities in the Mala Prespa region, is especially disputed.
The Albanian court 'decision came at a case against the Albanian court, which was launched by the Middle East Alliance, many local judges, as well as the main discrimination of ethnic and religious identity in the October census.
"Each month, the Greek minority will ask the Greek minority to be a special status, which is the parliament or the government," said Albanian Supreme Court of Justice Vice-President Kreshnik Spahiu.
The Council is headed by President Bamir Topi to monitor the judiciary.
Prosecutors claim that the government has made it clear that citizens have declared the constitution without a constitution, outside Albania.
Some sent a protest before the court decision to appeal in Strasbourg.
"The Macedonian minority in the Mala Prespa region is now recognised by the Macedonian minority, which is now recognised," Macedonian Alliance for European Integration President Edmond Temelko told SETimes.
"We want the Albanian authorities to allow freedom of expression of freedom of expression for all Macedonians in Albania, not only in Mala Prespa," he said.
"Greeks who are recognised as minority in the southern part of the country will no longer express themselves as Greeks.
This is applied for Serbs and Montenegro, even for the communities that are not recognised as minority, "he added.
"The situation is very concerned for us.
Our politicians, minority media, intellectuals and our country should not allow Tirana to live this sinsurance plan, "he said.
The court decision came only a few weeks after minorities expressed protests on the promises that Albanian politicians are not able to show ethnic ethnicity in the census.
Vantin Dule, a representative of the Greek minority of Human Rights, condemned the international community representatives in Tirana to reiterate their demands for dialogue and co-operation.
"The decision of the Constitutional court will be suspended in Strasbourg, because the Albanian constitution is disappointed by the 20th Madaster of the Republic of Albania," Dule said at a minority representatives in Korca recently.
At the meeting, minority representatives signed a joint declaration saying they did not recognise the results of the census in October.
The census, he said, has been pushing and abuse, and there is no transparency in enough levels.
"We have made a positive response to our boycott of minority member states, and there was no reason.
The census law is not aimed at revealing the real number of minorities, but the statistical statistics show that the protocol has continued discrimination policy, "the statement said.
It envisions an estimated 1,000 fees of Albanian miners, if they are not entering losses.
In such movements, the Albanian state continues to demonstrate its policy as a multiethnic country, which is not multiethnic and multiethnic, "he said.
The government has called on the government to launch a real dialogue to change the current law and to respect international standards.
At the beginning of October, Albanian Foreign Minister Edmond Haxhinasto met with his Macedonian counterpart, Nikola Popovski, saying the census results will reflect the truth of the census and that all minorities will be allowed to buy what they are.
"Full implementation of the census is important for the process to bring human rights with the international and European legal framework," Macedonian Foreign Ministry spokesman Borce Stamov told SETimes.
"What is needed to meet international standards is full and continued respect for recognition and not to be used by domestic laws," Stamov said.
Bulgaria gets Turks on its territory for "Unemployment Process"
The Bulgarian parliament adopted a decision to condemn the impression policy of the communist regime against ethnic Turks in the 1980s.

The announcement was adopted with the support of 115 deputies who participated in the session on January 11th. [Reuters]
About 22 years after the end of communism in Bulgaria, the country &aposs parliament adopted a declaration last week to condemn its policy to tackle ethnic Turks in the second half of the 1980s.
The statement, launched by Todor Jivkov, launched in 1984 by Todor Jivkov ", ended in 1989, when more than 360 Turkish citizens fled their homes and forced asylum to neighbouring Turkey.
As part of this policy, the communist authorities in the country tried to change ethnic Bulgarian Muslims in the beginning of their ethnic Turks, and later to the "traditional" figures of the Turkish-Arab ".
The declaration, proposed by former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov &aposHerzegovina (DSB) party, led by former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, was adopted by 115 lawmakers participating in the session on January 11th, while three other lawmakers were optimistic.
"We are deeply condemned the immunity process against the Muslim minorities in Bulgaria, including" the Observation Process ", the document said." We have declared an ethnic method that more than 360,000 Turkish citizens live in the island regime is implemented. "
The announcement also called for the country 'office and judicial authorities to make the results of the cases that were filed by the campaign.
The DSB also insisted that the perpetrators of crimes against ethnic Turks in one of the most modern history of Bulgaria have not been punished because of the legal time.
The document described the document as a lot of Turkish experts in Ankara and the government, as well as the trip.
The Turkish Foreign Ministry welcomed Bulgaria "decision to withdraw many people from the history of history", calling on Sofia to hand over its responsibilities for the campaign to justice and take steps to "convince all the details".
A Balkan expert at the International Strategic Research Council (USAK) in Ankara, Muzaer Kutlay, said the declaration was "an important step that Bulgaria has taken into account and further boost relations with Turkey".
"The move has provided an opportunity to create confidence climate in the two countries," Kutlay told SETimes. "Bulgaria also won an important discrimination by Turkey."
Addressing Bulgaria "to continue this trend", Kutlay also believes the Balkan country is "to take steps in education in Turkish language".
Bilal Now, a Turkish ambassador to Tirana from 1985-1987 to 1987, sparked the importance of the declaration.
"The decision by the Bulgarian National Assembly to condemn the immunity process has no value in the bridge, because Bulgaria does not accept the" minority ", which is in international law and states," he told SETimes.
"Bulgaria will be able to recognise" minority rights and protect the rights of minorities in the country as part of international convention ", and then then this decisions and autonomous mechanisms will be replaced by Parliament," he said.
Bulgarian Helsinki Committee President Krassimir Canev told SETimes that the winners of the campaign in late 1980s "are doubt that the justice will be made", despite the calls for the late 1980s ".
Bulgarian experts, however, see the move as a positive step.
Harlan Alexandrov, a teacher at the New Bulgarian University in Sofia on social antropology, told parliament that the move should create "provocation" on members of the ethnic Turkish community in the country.
"Some of these people are still reminded by violence, while others are doing it and their crowds," Alekserov told SETimes.
Alexandrov told SETimes that Turks now must feel "less defendant" against manipulation ".
The Movement for Rights and Freedoms (HOH) in the past period, he warned that Bulgarians could start "a second" Article Process "against ethnic Turks.
The party was established in 1990 to represent the interests of the ethnic Turkish minority.
The last 20 years have been represented in all assembly, and three coalition governments have been part of the coalition government since 1992.
After refusing to change the name, former HOH Vice-President General Dal, who was sentenced to three and a half years in prison in the 1980s, said he supported the declaration, but stressed that it should "be acceptable".
"There is no power," Dal told SETimes on Tuesday, adding that the campaign should be the beginning of the early 1990s, "so that the architects of justice" should be able to overcome justice ".

Albanians, who have a majority population of Kosovo, have different views that Kosovo will be on how the final status of Kosovo.
Some were convinced that Kosovo will soon be a sovereignty recognised by international areas, while others are undetermined whether it will be or time.
However, everyone agrees. However, the province will not remain under Serbian authority.
"I do not know that independence will be such, but I am convinced that Kosovo is on the right path," said Afrim Kabashi, a economist at the University of Pristina.
"I do not say they are unable, but they should be closer to each other," he said.
The same school student Ard Matoshi is urging the people of Kosovo to be resolved as the status process is resolved.
"I am afraid of the process, but I think there is no reason for what has been made in Kosovo in recent years, when I reminded that there has been such progress in the past years," Matoshi said.
According to journalist Zhiadin Gashi, a journalist from the daily Zeri, the public has been unresolved and disagreements between members of the Contact Group.
He believed that these delays are "the main factor that creates doubt and uncertainty", but added that there is a reason for optimistic in the long term.
"We have returned to the EU.
I believe we will meet all the criteria needed to join the Union in the coming years, "he said.
Burim Ramadani of the University of Pristina believes the status process will be only a result, despite delays.
"We have come from the end of a long negotiation and transition process.
The solution to the status issue will depend on the political will of the public, and this will not have doubt that it is the independence of Kosovo, "he said.
Ramadani is confident that Kosovo will be a "partnership state" that is recognised by the necessary judges to represent the interests of minority communities and represent their goals.
"A major decentralisation, society rights, the constitutional bill system will guarantee that minorities, especially Kosovo Serbs, will have power in the political structure of Kosovo," he said.
The status, however, will not be all of the long-term problems that are waiting the province.
"Kosovo will face real problems," Ramadani said.
"corruption and organised crime can be the most dangerous for Kosovo post-status," he said.
Bekim Ukaj, a lawyer, believes democracy institutions, a good justice system and the economic growth of Kosovo is key to a new future.
"These are the necessary paramilitaries for a better functioning state," Ukaj said.
Some, especially unemployment, have a sceptical position on the situation.
Ismail Slini says independence and economic development has been worried since 1999.
"They promised that we will have enough jobs and that the integration process will help us work abroad, not only in Kosovo," he said.
He wants his family to leave the province and work abroad.
"I work in every place, we have five children and they do not know something that will be," he said.
Kosovo has been on the south of Serbia and has been under UN administration since 1999.
Serbian nominal sovereignty is recognised by the international community, but the Serb administration in the province is not in the bridge.
The province has been managed by UNMIK and the local Reconstruction Bodies, while security in the NATO administration is providing the Kosovo Force (KFOR).

Getty Images to extradite Greece
Under an agreement with the J. Paul Getty Images Museum in California on Monday, two ancient individuals, including a golden funeral wrestling of the 4th century, according to the announcement Monday.

The museum will extradite two ancient artefacts believed to be fled to Greece in the early 1990s, J. Paul Getty Images said on Monday (December 11th).
"Today we are happy that we have announced that we have reached an agreement on the behalf of a Golden Cenaze Chamber of Culture and the Korean Hospeliu -- demanded by the Greek Culture Ministry," Dr. Michael Brand, director of the Getty Images and Getty Images Museum, said in a statement.
"The official agreement, which will be signed, will include details on the island of Greece, as well as plans to co-operate in the future between the Greek Culture Ministry and the J. Paul Getty Images Museum," the document said.
Both were the American museum in 1993, both based on the 4th century IC.
The museum is reportedly paying up to 4.45m.
On Monday, the announcement was made after nearly a year of talks between Greek officials and US museum.
A decade since Athens' flights were Greece.
The New York Times reported on Sunday that the so-called funeral wrestling and rivers was found by a farmer in the north of Greece in 1990, citing Greek police sources.
It later reached the market in Switzerland, where Germany and Getty Images former ancient producer Marion True had seen as the first time in 1992.
In the end, Getty Images have bought up to 1.15m.
On November 21st, a Athens prosecutor accused True and several others of their alleged involvement in the agreement.
The Kurdistan resigned last year after Italian authorities charged him with conspiracy in order to achieve ancient universities.
In July, the Getty Images Museum was acquitted -- two other ancient losses -- and J. Paul Getty Images, who bought the 4th century in the ancient city of Thebes in 1993, was extradited to Greece, where he bought a swimming in 1955.
In September, the German Hekguberg University has extradited a smallest centre of Parthenon.
The money will likely be exhibited at the new Acropol museum, which is expected to open next year.
Greek authorities hope to extradite other national treasures and ancient towns, especially the British Museum, which includes most of the Parthenon front of the Parthenon.
Around a week ago, a UN General Assembly proposed that Greece has proposed extradition or extradition to countries of cultural monuments.
"The acceptance of this decision shows the countries to help return to the citizens of around the world," Vulgarakis said on December 4th, welcoming the General Assembly decision. "The illegal weapons, drug and human trafficking in the same category."
The demonstrations and direct relations with money laundering are equal of organised crime. "
Kosovo seeks to boost co-operation with its neighbours
Kosovo, Montenegro and Macedonia are working to solve political problems and improve regional economic integration.

Kosovo and Montenegro are planning to sign an agreement in the economy, infrastructure, investment and tourism, to boost regional co-operation.
Kosovo Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj visited Podgorica last week to discuss the plans.
"The goal of regional infrastructure projects such as Railways and highway is to boost relations between the countries and make the European perspective of the region more complete," Montenegrin Prime Minister Igor Luksic said after talks.
Hoxhaj said relations with Macedonia, as well as the countries in the region are key to developing their economies.
Macedonian Parliament Speaker Trajko Veljanovski visited Pristina on January 10th, saying relations between the two countries are positive.
The Macedonian parliament recently recommended a declaration for recognition of Kosovo, and the other approved two consultations with Kosovo, including a document that has approved a provisional understanding with Kosovo.
"This is a sign of intensive co-operation between our countries.
Among the countries, the security, justice, economic and financial sectors has been accelerated, "he said.
Kosovo analysts said that in the first weeks of 2012, Kosovo and its neighbours are important to meet high-level talks, but concerns that countries will face the future.
Although Macedonia has been approved on the framework of the investigation, Montenegro has yet to do so.
Chairman of the Pristina Centre for Relations Abdullah Hasani told SETimes that Kosovo will prepare a border zone in 2012, and that would not exercise relations between Kosovo and Macedonia.
"I would like to see Macedonia as an example that both countries will be able to live in the problem.
In Montenegro, however, I fear that some groups can use this framework process in accordance with their own political reasons, "he said.
He added that the transition process with Montenegro is more difficult because of ethnic issues.
"We see the continuation of the Montenegrin constitution and the rights of Albanians in Montenegro have been on the agenda of the government, and that Hoxhaj has shown it," Hasani said.
"The number of Albanians are in Montenegro and Macedonia should be considered as an example of the current problems of ethnic issues," he said.
Kosovo free commentator Nicosia Sadiku told SETimes that co-operation between Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro should be improved.
"The cross-border co-operation, which has been over decades due to cultural, economic and family relations, should be the main point of the three government."
Sadiku says practical issues that facilitate a day life should be discussed.
"The establishment of a cross-free trade zone will attract more investment and condemn the economy.
Many who live in the areas around around the border are leaving for a better life because of the lack of business and economic development. "
Gashi said that the EU funds that have split cross-border co-operation should be better benefit from EU funds.
"The goal of such projects is to bring the economies of the countries in the border areas where they participate in the EU, but I see that these projects are a long-term effect on the census in border areas," Gashi said.

The new government began implementing austerity measures, but resistance faces

Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, who heads a country of about 3 billion euros and a 47 billion-euro debt, has implemented measures aimed at reducing spending and revenues.
The country is preparing to join the EU within 18 months, while the dangerous region has a notice on one.
Central Bank Governor Zeljko Rokinski said Croatia was "a very difficult year" in front of Croatia, and recommended that the budget will be reduced by 1.2 billion euros.
The new government, which took office last month, suggested that a 6% tax on mobile phone services was removed by the previous administration last October.
"We expect this budget to contribute 40m euros," the government said last week.
The tax, expected this week, will be implemented by June 2013.
The new plan envisions tax removing from the SMS and MMS messages two years ago.
"This is an estimated 8m euros annually.
The state could not be more money for the state, but the textile sector will be enough to rescue 20,000 jobs, "he said.
In addition, mobile telephone operators have been condemned to the Constitutional Court and threats to reduce investments.
"The government of the government has made it clear that the previous administration has been criticised by the EU as one of the steps taken," VIP Net, one of the three mobile phone operators operating in Croatia, said in a statement.
Among other measures for the ministries and public expenditures on public expenditures, state employees will decrease the use of state employees, mobile phone, airline and business travel.
Authorities in the state institutions -- the general secretary secretary-general, the number of ministries -- will decrease by a third.
Only, it will provide 130m euros to the state 'chapter.
The government also announced the possibility of bringing VAT increase, as well as a property tax aimed at boosting economic growth.
The Bank has come up with measures, saying the government will support its efforts to overcome the economy.
"We are awaiting a year of efforts to enter dialogue with the government to encourage economic restructuring and growth," said Ivana Prgomet, spokesperson for the Croatian Bank of Bank (HUB).
But Zeljko Lovrin, a professor of Economic Foundation and a member of the Zagreb Institute for Economy, told SETimes that these measures are only small steps in the direction.
"Pension salaries, salaries and other revenues are very difficult.
We have to cancel the officers' telephone funds to stop the state budget, "he said.
The Croatian Authorities' Association warned that new taxes will have negative impact on the economy.
"It is very important for us to reduce the amount of taxes and the amount of state administration.
Therefore, we are welcome any reform in the direction, because this is the only way to do the economy, "he said.
In both cases, consumers think the austerity measures are going to go.
"Tourists and tobacco staff are all those of the possible tax amendments and therefore raise prices.
In Croatia, I entered this year if I do not think that there will be no single workers who do not think it will be worse by last year.
Their prices are negotiating on prices and taxes, and we all know that they will pay. "
The government has promised that the most vulnerable categories of the population -- pensions and social aid -- will not be "doctor" and that the tax on basic food materials would stop.

Albania could be the most important elections since the end of communism on Sunday (June 28th).
In these elections, the country is likely to slowly slowly slowdown if the irregularities of irregularities are held.
"There is no problem, but there is no autonomy for the past, there is no autonomy," OSCE Ambassador to Albania Robert Bosch said at the 24th summit. "This time, the elections have to function," OSCE Ambassador to Albania said in a statement.
The same day, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said that a successful elections would open the way for the progress of the accession process.
"Albania must prove that Albania has undermined Western democracy standards," said Ambassador Audrey Glover, who heads the monitoring mission, headed by the Council of Democracy and Human Rights (ODIHR).
"If the elections do not get good, the workers will take very difficult."
The campaign, however, has even been marred by violence. Aleksander Keka, 34, a Christian Democratic Party member of the Christian Democratic Party, died on June 18th.
Before that, he was shot and killed in a debate on the removal of the campaign workers and was killed in May.
The tension of tensions is high prior to the beginning of this is expected.
The results will be the future of the opposition Socialists, led by Prime Minister Sali Berisha and leader of the Democratic Party, whether the country will be able to manage the country four years, or the mayor of Tirana, Edi Rama, the opposition Socialists, led by Tirana.
A total of four allies are participating in the elections.
The Democratic Party has been unanimous with the Alliance of Change, while the Socialist Party has established a partnership with the Union for Change.
Two smaller groups, including the Socialist Union for Integration, led by the National Freedom for Integration, have been created by the network, including the Socialist Movement for Integration.
During the campaign, the ruling Democratic Party has made the current achievements such as a new highway connecting Albania and Kosovo, and said it is ready to meet the visa liberalisation and accession process.
"We have fulfilled the words that we have made in four years, and our victory is the victory of European projects," Berisha said at a rally in Fier on Tuesday.
Rama was based on the alliance with a "new policy" strategy, with some new candidates and the most new party in the country, G99.
The party was established this year as a civilian movement by Mjaft in Albania.
"This is not a war between socialists and democrats.
This is a wartime to close the former world, which has been removed by 18 years and open a new world, "he said.
The survey will not be presented.
The latest survey, organised by Top Channel TV, said 40% of respondents voted to the Democratic Party, while 38% of the Socialists voted in the Socialists.
Greece monitors Schengen plans
Greece, which has been in the Schengen Age since 2000, has a chance to live both the benefits of unlimited life and the challenges.

Greece has a special position in controversial discussions, with the EU criteria to end visa restrictions for Western Balkan countries, which meet the necessary criteria.
The country is the only country that has full membership in the Schengen Aegean, except of Slovenia, and has also improved its role in the region.
government officials say they are committed to the process.
"Greece … is the liberalisation of the visa regime that the Western Balkan countries can travel to European countries," Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said after talks with Serbian counterpart Vuk Jeremic in May.
However, there are some scepticism about the benefits of public borders, while some worry that economic immigration is increasing.
In recent years, Greece has passed itself more than 2 million foreign workers.
These workers have become part of the economy, but also changed the country ’ s social and cultural doctors.
The Greeks, which reminded the time the Homojenje is more, are still interested in such changes.
Moreover, many are responsible for the increase in organised crime.
Critics argue that reducing border restrictions could be an obstacle to smuggling networks operating in the Balkans.
Although the Greek-run visa obstacles are planning, restrictions are still under control of the economic movement.
For example, legal immigrants continue to remain foreign, instead of accepting children.
At the same time, authorities have also taken steps to make up less difficult for visitors.
Last May, the country removed visa fees for Serbs and said it would submit other countries that have fulfilled the provisions needed under the Schengen facility.
Greece is now visa for citizens of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.
Bulgarian, Croatian and Romanian citizens can travel to the country.
During talks with Jeremic, Bakoyannis described Serbia as "an integral part of the European family".
Greece is "ready to accept a lot of Serb friends to visit us this summer," he said.
Bakoyannis also backed Albanian efforts to meet the Schengen criteria.
"We support the visa liberalisation process of Albania as a very important process for increasing interethnic relations between the Western Balkan countries," he said.
Macedonia, meanwhile, is awaiting to see whether the name dispute between its neighbours has become a factor.
The European Commission recently confirmed that Skopje has met the conditions for visa-free travel.
In the past, Athens said its stance on easing the visa regime would depend on the name issue.
However, Greek Ambassador Aleksanra Papadoinou told A1 television on May 11th that his country supports Macedonia 'participation in the Schengen "White List".
Papadoniou did not propose a certain post.
According to Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Bocevski, Greece has already taken a stance to Macedonia 'NATO membership and threatened to veto EU membership, the process is likely to block the process.
What is a new momentum in Macedonia &aposs name talks?
In a OSCE meeting in Corfu, Greece and Macedonia will have an opportunity for talks between the foreign ministers, and UN envoy Matthew Nimetz says it is time to boost the process.
However, serious obstacles remain.

UN mediator Matthew Nimetz will visit Skopje and Athens from 6 July to 9 July to find a solution to the long-standing name dispute between Greece and the northern Republic of Macedonia.
The two sides continue talks this week in Ceneva, following a four-month siege.
Nimetz said the debate was prepared for meetings in the coming months, and there is no new proposal.
However, he said, both countries have expressed their willingness to speak and find a solution "." Now it is a good time to boost the negotiation process. "
Macedonian Foreign Minister Antonio Milososki said on Thursday (June 25th) the possibility of a new momentum.
At a press conference with Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak, Milososki said the OSCE ministers' conference in Corfu could create an opportunity to launch dialogue.
The foreign minister said that "a new dynamic and rhetoric" is possible.
Nikola Gruevski, the country &aposs prime minister, said that "workers are going to go in a positive direction".
Despite the optimism, however, the basic dispute remains.
Greece says an unacceptable island should contain a geography, such as "northern" and use international areas.
However, its neighbour argues that the countries "Republic of Macedonia" and should continue to do so.
"Our autonomy should not be based on the countries that have recognised our constitutional name, and the number of these are 120," Macedonian negotiator Zoran Jolevski said.
He added that any agreement should be based on the Macedonian constitution, nor the Macedonian constitution.
Milososki rejected the idea of geography as unnecessary.
Gruevski said a deal reached by the outcome of the negotiating talks should be based on the public in the referendum.
Meanwhile, Greece continues to maintain its neighbour and accusing its full commitment to resolving the problem.
Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis said authorities in Skopje are expecting "a different political approach to a acceptable solution in both sides".
Bakoyannis also confirmed that the Macedonian government has requested a meeting between him and Milososki at the OSCE meeting in Corfu and would try to seek it.

The trial of nine people charged with the murder of former Serbian President Ivan Stambolic began on Monday (February 23rd) at the Special Court in Belgrade.
Most of the defendants are also charged with involvement in the assassination of Serbian political Vuk Draskovic.
Slobodan Milosevic, the judge in The Hague, has been charged with ordering both murders.
Stambolic disappeared during a park in Belgrade on August 2000.

The case was clear until April, when police investigated the assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, Stambolic was found at a ceremony in northern Vojvodina.
Stambolic, a prominent tolerance and close friend of Milosevic, was dismissed by his students in December 1987.
Following the results, Stambolic criticised Milosevic ’ s policies in the Balkan wars in the 1990s.
The former Yugoslav leader denied that one would not want to death as a threat to the political career last August, claiming he would not want any incident against the murder.
"Ivan Stambolic is no longer a person.
"It was unfortunately," he said.
Mira Markovic, who was believed to be hiding in Russia, was accused of involvement in the same matter, and was rejected by charges.
Nikola Barovic, a lawyer representing the Stambolic family, told the BBC that Milosevic has rejected the prosecution and said Stambolic remains a "important name" after Stambolic was dismissed.
"Macedonia could continue its stable and stable relations with all former Yugoslav republics and in Yugoslavia," Barovic said.
This was one of the reasons that Milosevic would repeat the murder of Bay Stambolic, "he said.
Milorad "Legija" Lukovic, suspected of the assassination of Djindjic, is charged with organised crime and murder of Stambolic, who has been formed in the Milosevic regime and is now disbanded by a special police unit.
Lukovic is on the run and will be tried to be tried.
Among those indicted for the murder, Stambolic is former head of the secret police force, Radomir Markovic and former Yugoslav Chief of General Staff Nebojsa Pavkovic.

PACE decision on Bosnia and Herzegovina sparked RS leaders
The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a decision on September 30th to facilitate the progress of the country on the EU integration path.

At a meeting in late September, the Council of Europe (PACE) of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a decision to continue BiH institutions to continue constitutional changes, removing votes at the state parliament and strengthen state institutions at the entity level.
The decision calls for the removal of all discrimination materials in the country 'constitution.
A unilateral voting of the BiH Federation and Republika Srpska, the two separate administrative entity entities, the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska, passed the Dayton Peace Accord, which ended the 1992-1995 war in BiH.
Some observers say this vote is clear to prevent parliamentary decisions that no one of the entities did not obtain parliamentary decisions.
The Dayton Agreement continues to be the constitution of the country.
The decision came from a report by Finnish Kimmo Sassi and Turkish Mevilt Caviloglu, who is the PACE &aposs BiH rapporteur reports.
Sassi and Caviloglu have linked BiH to reforms, claiming that the entity has blocked reforms and undermined state institutions.
This report and the decision focused on Bosnian parliamentary consultations -- Milica Markovic and Mladen Ivanic -- at the session.
Parliament requested the verdict of three of the verdicts: urging the removal of a entity votes to be removed: the RS National Assembly condemned the decision, calling for the right to secure its own woman, and accuses RS at the state level.
PACE lawmakers, however, rejected these demands.
Only days before the CoE decision was approved, the Bosnian Muslim member of the BiH presidency, Haris Silajdzic, speaks at the PACE meeting in Strasbourg, France.
In his speech, Silajdzic criticised the unilateral vote, saying it is a major obstacle to the decision mechanism, so that BiH has blocked its progress towards EU membership.
Silajdzic also called for "a major reform" in the Dayton constitution, if BiH and the region can jeopardise peace and stability.
RS Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said RS representatives will never accept the removal of a unilateral vote, because "it would mean that this would be a basis for the Dayton Peace Accord and to give the institutional mechanisms that protect the experiences in BiH".
Although the CoE &ap91; decision] has not been constructive, the CoE must fulfil all provisions of BiH to end Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Although the country was a CoE member in 2002, it was not able to fulfil all the requirements for membership, which has been made in the time.
Mevlana: Islamic Government
Mevlana, a poet and artist, more than 700 years ago from terrorism and extremist groups such as El al-Qaeda and Haramin, continues to remind the swimming of Islam.
By Fatih Baran for Southeast European Times in Istanbul - 19 / 01 / 04
In a climate of violence that caused by extremists and militants, the poet -- more than 700 years ago -- continues to consider Islamic swimming.
Mevlana Celaldin Rumi, known as Rumi in the English countries, is known for peace, tolerance, tolerance and brother philosophy against people and all of them.
The remarks are still under way.
Mistical poet Rumi founded the Mevlevi agriculture (Sema Derva), or Supreme, and helped restore Islamic opinion with his clothes.
Mevlana has a strong effect in Turkey, which is seen as a model for the broad Muslim community and a bridge between the Middle East and Christian West.
Each year in December, products and tourists are in Konya to present their respects to Mevlana during the death anniversary of the death.
Sufi philosophy is a lot, crowd, season and peace.
Human is seen as a small house and is believed to be able to know itself in order to prove a large house.
As a direct spirit between Tank and his son, traditional religious sites continue to gain the rules of respect and prosperity.
According to Mevlana, people are Ruh, Mandk and a third of the establishment of the Sevasion.
"There is no bad things of us.
And you have returned to us a day, "he said." The poverty of his life is a profitable and phenomenon.
"It is a widespread Sufi Index.
The bottom of the products sympathy symbolises to establish the world from its homes, free, and prepare to unify with Tanran.
Sema is the three homes representing Tanran, searching and unification with Tanr. First, the disasters have returned to three times in the concept of the beautiful networks.
In the second part, they are symbolised to bring the world to the concerns.
So far, the mountains have begun to seek a slowly slow slowdown in the crowd of the slowdown.
"The move would give us a lot of concern," he said. "We do not get something."
In recent years, the Mevlana philosophy -- the persecution of humanitarian, liquidation and property -- is increasingly attracting many people.
In the last decade, the Western Europe, Britain and the United States were explosive.
Supreme Islam has opened an optimistic paper to the messages of extremist extremists.
As the swimming movie office -poet, many see Islam 'tolerance and love religious.
Berisha supports Albanian -- Israel relations
Despite the main business and investment, Prime Minister Sali Berisha also backed Israel on the Palestinian issue.

During a three-day visit to Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and Tel Aviv, Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha criticised the unilateral efforts to achieve sovereignty status.
Such movements "have stopped the peace process, instead of improving the political solution", Israel 'National News Agency quoted Berisha as saying.
"The Palestinians do not mean that this is true," Berisha said. "The peace, direct talks between Israel and Palestinians and the Palestinians should be able to provide security in the two states."
Berisha met with President Noon Peres, Prime Minister Benjamin Netau and other important officials during his visit to the end of Wednesday (November 23rd).
During his visit, Prime Minister has made efforts to boost business relations with Israel and encourage investors to participate in projects such as construction of about 43 new hydropower plants.
During his meeting with Peres, Berisha cited agriculture, tourism, energy and information technologies among key areas that can improve economic co-operation.
According to the University of Tirana professor and analyst Henri Clini, the visit shows the importance of Israel on international relations and growth in business relations with Albania.
"There are at least 20 Israeli companies who have worked in different areas, such as fiscal, energy, services and others," he told SETimes.
He also stressed that the visit stressed Albania ’ s role in the international area.
"Israel will have an effect on Kosovo, which has not recognised as a state," he said.
Albania seems to be a cautious approach to the Palestinian issue, Clini said, calling Berisha &aposs stance as realistic and pragmatic.
"I do not think this will have any impact on relations with Turkey or other countries.
Turkey and Turkey have good traditional relations.
Israel relations with Israel are very important, "he said.
Meanwhile, the strengthening of economic relations could help Albania to deal with the current global economic crisis, Colan Bala, the Tirana company of Comport, said.
The investments in agriculture have made a concrete benefit to Albania, but also enabled the food supplies to Israel at a time when food materials are expected to increase, Bala said.
At the same time, Bala said, the property market in Albania -- the country is expected to increase prices on its path to EU membership -- could strengthen the money from Israel.
"Albania must also develop its own capital market, and this will be the interest of rich countries such as Israel," Bala said.
The relations between the two countries reflect a long friendship.
The Balkan country sees widespread praise because none of its asylum seekers to Albania during World War II was not transferred to Nazler.
At the time, Albania, the communist era, recognised Israel as soon as Israel declared its independence in 1948.
The diplomatic relations, however, have not been formed until August 1991, when the communist regime fall.
technical dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina continue
Following seven weeks after the process of violence at border crossings, the negotiators held a resumption in Brussels this week.

The crossing issue is one of the main problems Belgrade and Pristina must resolve. [Reuters]
The delegation representing Belgrade and Pristina reached an agreement Monday (November 21st) on recognition of university diplomats.
The EU, which was mediated for the talks, confirmed on July 2nd that "the two sides have agreed on the European Union to ratify diplomats in both sides" by the University of Europe, as well as the diplomats of universities in education and public employment, "the EU confirmed after an agreement reached on July 2nd.
Dukagjin Pupovci, director of the Kosovo Centre for Education, said Kosovo will not benefit from this agreement, but believes other Serbian citizens who have learned in Presevo Vadini and Kosovo will benefit.
"However, this job depends on the Serbian entity: what is serious on this issue, and it will not accept diplomats after the European universities ratified by the Union," Pupovci told SETimes.
The agenda of the sides met in Brussels also includes other issues such as the cleaning of Pristina in regional assembly, census administration and unified border management between Kosovo and Serbia.
These technical talks were suspended on September 27th, following clashes between Serbs and KFOR troops in northern Kosovo.
Nevertheless, Belgrade and Kosovo Serbs have revealed that Kosovo customs officers in the north are unacceptable, and local Serbs have formed barricades to protest.
The dialogue with Pristina, meanwhile, was conditioned on December 9th that the EU Council will decide on whether Belgrade will be given to EU candidate status.
After talks in Brussels, the head of the Belgrade delegation, Borislav Stefanovic, said the delegation is doing everything to reach an agreement, but it does not know that Serbia does not have the green light to the EU candidacy.
"In any case, the candidacy or final application has a long time, but these problems have to be resolved and we have to do everything in northern Kosovo and Metohija, because we have been resolved, and we have to do everything, because we live in a heavy crisis," Stefanovic said.
Pristina has insisted that Kosovo does not reflect the state situation and Serbia did not reach any other solution because it does not recognise it, Stefanovic added.
Edita Tahiri, head of the Kosovo delegation, also appeared in the same way, told the media that deep differences between Pristina and Belgrade continue.
"This round was found that we can say that we have closed with a concrete agreement that requires a very unprecedented agreement and that I would not accept nothing that the state border was announced by Pristina," Stefanovic said.
Belgrade Political Sciences professor Predrag Simic told SETimes the problems in Kosovo are very complicated and that the short border has brought a border.
"In one way, the decision on the EU Council meeting and the candidacy of Belgrade is approaching the general elections in Serbia.
"The negotiations with the Zaman couple have a risk for relations between Belgrade and Pristina," he said.
In Serbia, however, the opposition is using talks to accelerate the position of European officials to recognise the independence of Kosovo.
"If we receive status, this will not be any reason for the country 'economic and other effective development.
Now, it will not happen.
The final outcome of the talks is that Serbia is going from Kosovo and Metohija, "he said.
Kosovo Independent Media Commission repeated
As of now, the Independent Media Commission is not fully working for Kosovo.

The Kosovo Independent Media Commission (ECC) has been almost functioning since December 2010, as some Council members are members.
Four members have not enough personnel to work because of the end of the two-year mandate, and the Kosovo Assembly does not choose those who do not choose them to replace them.
"We are managing a key part of the sector, which we are responsible for the arrangements in the Council," DPC manager Naaaai Selimaj Krasniqi told SETimes.
There are a long-term task list that expects to be finished.
The system also includes new licenses and cabinet operators' demands for technical and operational reform.
The commission has to serve in amendments to the amendments of valuable regulations and to advance the national digital transition strategy.
Tomor Halilay is managing the "Intersat" couple service in Drenas / Gllogovac, in central Kosovo.
Although it submitted documents, the license expects.
Meanwhile, there is a risk of punishment for illegal operations.
"I expect the prospect for the approval of the lessons' lessons," Djilay told SETimes. "I expect official agencies to not exercise the documents.
Therefore, they say they did not approve the list because it is intellectual. "
The European Commission said the Kosovo Assembly has yet to complete the appointment of five MPC members of the Kosovo Assembly, in the 2011 Progress Report.
Earlier in 2011, the DPC presented a list of eight candidates elected from 17 public candidates in the first quarter of the seats.
A special committee, representing all political parties, presented the list to four people and submitted to vote.
In July, however, parliament dismissed the proposed candidates for failing to declare the steps.
The Committee headed a member of the ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), Berat Bukaga.
He says the group has completed its own part of the post.
"There are things in the DPC," he told SETimes. "It is clear that the responsibility for the extradition is parliament.
I have served as the head of the Ben special committee, and he was postponed.
However, there is no stalemate. "
Another committee member, Alh Lama, a member of the opposition Vetevendosje party, says the parliament is on the government level, while the problem is at the government.
"The government has a staff to control independent institutions.
This is the job of them and therefore members of the new ICC Council are not elected, "he said.
Former head of the agency, Pallora Bytyci, says the property of the Kosovo Assembly is not a new thing.
According to Bytyci, the parliamentary council has not chosen the fifth member of the parliament since 2008, which is a direct mandate of the law.
"The delays in parliament began in 2007, after the mandate of the two Council members ended," Bytyci said.
Authorities say the verdict is more complicated in the media, and the Council of Europe has stopped in a time when its obligations were forced.
In addition, there is a great uncertainty on the final outcome, decentralisation continues.
"We have a strategy that includes other shares, but without the final approval of the Council, there is no risk of opposing in the past minute," Krasniqi said, noting that the organisation [reputation of the public].
War Crimes continues to affect many BiH citizens
About half of the BiH population continues to affect the 1992-95 war.
Experts warn that the problem could be worried if there is no interest.

"For years, there has been the same restaurant in front of the night -- a hundreds of restaurants, a explosion, and a milestone has been sparked," BiH War Staff, 50, told SETimes.
I tried to cover this outlook, but not benefit.
I am beginning to terrorism, I have a smoking, and this is under way for years, "he said.
Another war veteran, Mehmed Alic, has a similar story.
At the same time, three years of retail, four times emigrated and doctors have been simply left.
However, the swimming of his close friend is still unable to leave.
The share of the Mermin has been under control since it shared its traffic with a psychologist.
Alic says the psychological idea is difficult, but there is no more speculation to withdrawal of his family, due to the qualification of the qualification situation.
"My children are flexible.
"There is no reason and only a battle of the war," he said.
Although the war ended 16 years ago, the post-traffic zone (PTSD) is a continuous increase in the number of people, experts say.
The most former soldiers were victims, but they apply to professional aid from their fears of discrimination.
"Many are seeking professional psychologists or psychological psychologists who fear a job is difficult," Dragan Sajic, head of the Jedinsto broadcaster, founded for people in Banja Luka, told SETimes.
According to the World Health Organisation, the population of BiH is 10% of the population, another 400,000 people were discovered by PTSD.
The PTSD, however, claims that the right figure is four times.
The PTSD is a normal response to the living conditions, doctors say.
"The former soldiers do not worry themselves, but many major assets and the post-war health problems have a lot.
"They want to solve them through the intellectual immunity of people and similar people," he said.
"If the PTSD complaints can be intolerated or patient, it can be patient if there is no human or patience, it can be taken under constant," Dzubur Kulenovic, from Tuzla PTSD magazine, told SETimes.
The PTSD also affects only war veterans, but also those who were removed during the war.
Obrad Bubic, a representative of the Republika Srpska Association of Convention Campames, said that about 200 former prisoners in Banja Luka have applied to professional assistance in the past two years.
"The PTSD families and the society are not known as those people, such as war veterans," Professor Doktor Mevludin Hasanovic, told SETimes.
Instead of a family climate, many of the future generations live in a fear that will be trained, "he said.
The NGOs and government organisations in BiH are working on reducing the consequences of the war on the health of the war, offering a joint group that needs assistance.
As BiH public companies do not have enough to deal with the budget, the problem continues to transport the ground.
Ivan Shijakovic of Banja Luka, a coach of Banja Luka, says the PTSD victims will give the society, but the society has been giving them.
"These people do not come to the job of the BiH authorities, whereabouts affected by the situation, so that people affected by the situation are completely discovered and are submitted to their own hands, and the churches that must be avoided to the society.
The main problem is that we do not have an expert institutions that will address such problems, "he said.
"We are aware of our union that we are really from the arms, but we have to show our injuries.
We are helping similar organisations in the other side, because we are all the road to those who have been opposed, "he said.

Despite remarks that the number of women in the government will increase, the number of women in the list of May 8th will be less than the number of candidates.

Albanian President Bamir Topi speaks to participants at the OSCE meeting this month. [OSCE]
In Albania, the political parties have promised to act in line with the principles of gender equality and equal political representation in the local elections on 8 May have not been called for the candidates for women 'candidates.
Only 17 per cent of the total 768 candidates are only 17 per cent and 3 per cent are women.
Three months ago, political parties promised that the candidates will comply with the election law, which envisions 30 per cent of women.
"No writer political parties have a true between the promises that women are able to increase their presence in the process of decision in politics," President Bamir Topi said at a meeting earlier this month on improving the role of women in the OSCE.
"Of course, the political parties have not been autonomy as a cultural behaviour.
We have always gone the votes of voters' votes and values, so that the candidates are still in a political climate where they are still safe candidates, "he said.
"The current shortcomings of gender equality in governments in the country must be implemented, and all the national and international partners are substantial," said OSCE Ambassador to Tirana Eugen Wollfh.
Women 'rights actions have different views on the reasons for women to be represented in politics.
"This is defined by political leaders," said Blerina Metaj, a group of members who supported the participation of young people, youth and minorities.
Temel is responsible.
They are not equal for women and men. "
The UN National Women Programme co-ordinator, Fiorela Shaller, is charged with the electoral code that the parties and their husband are not guaranteed.
"The greatest obstacle to women and young people to enter politics in the world shows that the main obstacle is our political parties.
Women in Albania are not nominated in the elections, because they see support by men 'politicians.
Women have to fight significant and true information, discrimination party mechanisms, "he said.
Otherwise, the decision requires a long controversial fight in the process of decision, and the intervention should be very boycotted, he added.
However, actions are not the same idea.
Albanian Human Rights Group head Elsa Ballauri says the biggest decline of women in this issue is still.
"The greatest damage is the women.
Women are not aware of what they are important, and they do not know how women should reveal their cars -- especially in politics.
They have changed their innovations as they work with the men, "Ballauri said."
"Those who have continued to continue the atrocities of men in Asia, with women.
Women enjoy the committee and service of their children as part of this role, ensuring the benefits of men and direction to their children. "

The Albanian economy is not good and the accusations have started.

Other important economic indicators, consumption expenses have dropped. [Reuters]
The government has also acknowledged that a number of economic demonstrations in the first quarter of 2012, following a slow slowdown in economic growth in the past two years, have pointed out critical decline in the Albanian economy.
According to the INOT, inflation reached 0.6% in February, as well as the most serious couple of demands and consumption, as well as the most serious couples of consumption.
Special and public investments have decreased.
The biggest coup was construction and industrial sectors.
According to INOT, consumption of Albanians in the first two months of this year has decreased, imports in a number of categories and exports dropped by 21%.
A major resources of the Albanian economy, the diaspora visits showed 9% compared to 2010.
The government should have to accept the crisis long ago, said former head of the Central Bank of Albania Selkim Cani.
"The government did not take any measures and we are now participating in the consequences of their computer, reality and reactions," he told SETimes.
He predicts that this year will be more difficult.
"The debt is very high, and it is now reluctant to the borders," Cani said, adding that the debt levels will be higher because of the election of 2013.
The market levels have reached a symbolic border around 60% of GDP.
Research Director Gjergge Palipi of the Indian company Agenda Institute is also concerned.
"The government, the largest investor in the country and the largest investor in the country, has been less expensive in 2010 and 2011, and the data from the first months of 2012 confirmed that the country is in the crisis," Palipi told SETimes.
However, MP of the ruling Democratic Party, Shaedin Sehu, is different to the issue.
"There is no other aspect of decentralisation in the tender, which is designed," Shau, a member of parliament 'Economy and Finance Committee, told SETimes, adding that the austerity is a psychological response to international crisis.
"It is not only the factors in Albania.
Albania is affected by the crisis, we are slowly slow, and there is no decline in economic growth, "he said.
In order to increase consumer consumption, the Central Bank has declined to 4.25%, which is now the lowest historical level, but markets' response was weakened.
"The money policy could be more aggressive.
The Central Bank could take a more aggressive decline in the interest rates of 1% in the three-month period, "he said.
Cehu suggests that as one of the economic slowing ways, investments and employment is "the state sector" to boost investments and employment ".
The institutions, institutions, public administration, infrastructure, human capital and good management could be a way for reforms, as well as support for smaller and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture.
The structural problems must be resolved, he said.
However, he adds, "the reform may be an excellent and excellent, but the lack of them would" lead to growth ".
The IMF aims to economic growth by 0.7% this year, while the regional level of 0.7%.
The estimates of the Albanian government is much optimistic.
EUFOR, NATO soldiers hold pressure on their homes of Mladic
International soldiers stated on Tuesday in a bid to find a lot that Ratko Mladic is in the case of two explosives in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The international soldiers in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) held a new operation against former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic on Tuesday (February 10th) at a new operation against the environment of his support, the chief war crimes suspect and renovated homes.
EUFOR, who heads the operation, said the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has been fulfilled.
The UN tribunal "has been unable to seek information to help the ongoing search work", Amac said.
Mladic 'wife, Milica Avram and his renowned Radio Radinka, also served as NATO soldiers and Republika Srpska (RS) police in raids near Sarajevo, where Mladic lives.
International forces have not been arrested, but they have not been arrested.
"Both operations have been in co-operation and untrue," EUFOR spokesperson Patrick O Callazan told Reuters on Tuesday. "The questions will continue and documents will take place."
Mladic disappeared less than 13 years ago, after UN prosecutors issued his first indictment against war crimes during the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH.
Mladic allegedly committed genocide during the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 43-month Sarajevo and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and children.
Relations think Mladic is hiding in Serbia, while officials have announced that it would be given 1m euros to provide information that would provide the capture of the indictee in recent years.
In a statement Tuesday, EUFOR said that any person who brought the information could also receive the US award for 3.9m euros, which has taken over years ago.
The full co-operation with the ICTY, including the arrest and climate of war crimes indictees, is a key condition for the Balkan countries' acceptance of the 27-nation bloc, which hopes to join the EU.
While noting that the RS internal affairs ministry continued co-operation in efforts to bring war crimes indictees to justice, EUFOR praised members of "professionals, courts and determination to close this case".
Rai Gregorian, a senior representative in BiH, announced on Tuesday that Mladic has expressed support for the future efforts to capture the capture of the indictment against its support.
Addressing the failure of Mladic to hand over the number of surrenders of Serbian authorities, Gregorian said that "a officer would not be a" more complete behaviour ".
Another war crimes suspect -- former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic -- is the ICTY 'failure to end the Balkan conflicts.

This spring will be able to see fears from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in EU countries.
Four BiH firms -- Mostar, Blagaj, Banja Luka and Stolac -- followed a long-standing fight against EU regulations, at the end of the Union &aposs widespread export to member states.
It is also one of the few BiH exporters, particularly the demands of the country ’ s veterinary agency -- that the EU could compete in the EU market.
"This exports allows us to sell our exports to the sales in Europe.
We have wrapped up our countries on fiscal exports, and the facilities could begin as soon as possible, "he said.
However, four firms that have received these goods last year are still unwilling to start a bigger exports.
Companies' managers say the prices in the EU are unlikely to bring profits under tax rates.
Polls are opposed to the EU as much as it is low in a bill of tax on the crowd.
Currently, each company can export exports as part of the tax conservative, there are 60 tonnes of alcohol annually.
They are negotiating with unity on the rise of tax implementation.
As the EU has high huge standards on food imports, BiH lives every year of a billion-euro trade deficit with the bloc and has exported only a few million euros, especially in security or quality costs every year.
Nevertheless, the BiH Cveterinary agency is trying to export products for subsidiary and concept products, as well as exports for some minimum products.
The country will benefit the benefits of exports to the Constitutional European (CE), if they can be able to tackle the stamp.
CE labour goods can be sold in the EU in each member states.
Local businessmen believe that the International Standing Organisation "is still on the basis of EU consumers, and the CE does not meet the requirements for consumption.
Radomir Marinkovic, co-ordinator of the PHARE programmes in BiH, warns that such intellectual cars will not sell themselves in CEFTA countries soon, because their European rules are more fast from BiH to implement European rules.
Marinkovic has accused the government of failing to trust the importance of the CE stamp.

Although the majority of Croatian people are satisfied with their lives, 64% believe their countries are in wrong direction, according to a Balkan Monitor survey.
However, only 7% are preferred to go abroad for better economic prospects.
The survey results were presented at a conference in Zagreb last week.
The Balkan Monitor survey, held in September and October 2008, is the biggest public opinion in the region.
The survey is a joint project of the European Fund and the Gallup company.
The study is repeatedly viewed by Balkan citizens' living standards, EU, business opportunities abroad and views of governments' performances.
Gallup European director Robert Manchin presented the survey results at a conference Friday (February 6th).
Insights and Perceptions: Voices in the Balkans
According to poll, one of three people in Macedonia fear a new conflict in the region
"European institutions … should take responsibility if Balkan states want to support the EU.
In addition, Croatia is a leader of EU integration and most Croatian people do not see themselves as part of the Balkans, "he said.
More than 25% of the surveys supported the Union 'membership.
Although the number of citizens who say that EU membership is useful for their country, the number of citizens (26%) said they are harmful. (38%), the majority of respondents (38%) have not been in question.
The survey says the Croatian people have declined to the EU.
Polls say the ongoing Mediterranean border dispute with Slovenia is one of the main elements in the survey that participated in the Union.
In addition to the results of the public research, the Panels also discussed the issue of EU reforms: "Croatia has been on the issue of EU reforms?" Manchin, a member of the European Fund, Hedvig Morai, the National Assembly of the Western Balkans, Vesna Pusic, a professor and NGO at the Croatian Foreign Ministry, Zarko Puovski, who also
According to Bozinovic, Croatia still has no position on the EU negotiating chapters on only three of the EU negotiating chapters.
"These chapters include justice, fundamental rights and market competition.
I think we are time to meet our goals in the next period, "he said.
Following the survey results, Pusic said they are often reflected.
"Croatia must be a tolerance against organised crime," he said.
For us, the most important thing is judicial reform, "he said.
Puhovski also voiced doubt that Brussels is aware of its failure to meet Zagreb, saying it is more important for Croatia to join the EU.
Once 82% of Kosovo participants, only 46% of the Croatian people said they are "satisfied with the EU".

Kosovo question
There are serious concerns that any further delay in the cabinet of the Ahtisaari proposal, which envisions supervised independence for Kosovo, the Kosovo leaders of the unilateral declaration of independence.
By Robert Austin and Igor Jovanovic for Southeast European Times -- 06 / 07 / 07

Last week, the EU calls for increasingly delay over the Kosovo status issue.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn warned on Wednesday (July 4th) that any success on the Kosovo status issue would be the price of Russia or the United States, not Russia or the United States.
His call came after EU security chief Javier Solana said on Tuesday that Brussels wants to reach a compromise on the Kosovo issue as soon as possible.
The bloc has made a new resolution based on the UN Security Council, which is based on the plan for supervised independence by former UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari.
At this point, all government safety in Kosovo is doubt that the province authorities can do the only way to keep them in a good park.
They thought everything will be completed by the end of May, and they continue to continue their prospects for accepting the Ahtisaari plan.
Kosovo leaders have warned that if the Security Council does not decide, they will go on their own ways.
The international community is not known to be more effective.
Last month, the US envoy for Kosovo Frank Wisner reiterated Washington &aposs support for Kosovo independence and said the final goal should be sovereignty of the province.
However, Wisner said, "it is important that independence will be prepared for recognition and it is important to win as a UN Security Council resolution that would open the door to NATO and the EU."
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica says Serbia wants negotiations between Belgrade and Pristina to decide on the status issue. [Getty Images]
The unilateral declaration of independence is dangerous for a number of reasons.
Before all, the EU and the region will harm all those who have been earmarked for years to promote regional stability and integration.
We need the Balkan countries to say they want Europe and the United States to say they want the Ahtisaari plan. How do you want to enter Euro-Atlantic clubs?
In addition to the study, the Security Council will take over a joint voter responsibility from the United States / the United States and to clean everyone.
The Security Council plays a greater role in Serbia, if the EU and the United States do not vote.
Albania will be one of the first countries to open in Pristina, while the rest of the region will have to take more active agriculture.
For example, Montenegro, which must continue good relations with Serbia, will not be one of the first recognition of Kosovo.
Macedonia has little things to lose, and the Albanian minority cannot take foreigners.
Bulgaria and Romania will leave the end of the witnesses, such as Montenegro.
If Bosnia, Bosnia and Herzegovina does not recognise Kosovo, Croatia and Slovenia could not be able to do it, if it is a situation that will do with the weak federation.
While Britain does not change its stance in supporting the Ahtisaari plan, French President Nicolas Sarkozy 'proposal for talks between Albanians and Serbs have not been met in Kosovo.
Belgrade will continue to postpone a final solution on Kosovo, in a bid to convince the country as it comes to convincing that an independent Kosovo would be a dangerous international arbitration.
As a result, the Belgrade diplomacy network is also targeted to EU member states that can live with discriminations in their own parts of the Security Council -- Slovakia, South Africa and Indonesian -- as a result of the secession of Kosovo.
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica has insisted that Belgrade has insisted on the continuation of talks with Pristina, but said the talks would require no longstanding consequences if the borders or success.
Belgrade also called for a new international mediator.
At the same time, Belgrade will also want to revive its position in Kosovo, especially in the northern part of Pristina.
The main problem, however, is that only 130,000 Serbs in Kosovo live in the north, where the rest is the majority of the Albanian population.
Kosovo and Metohija Minister for Kosovo Slobodan Samardzic said Serbia wants to invest in Kosovo and do everything to ensure a major presence in the province 'institutions.
If the foreign factors are leaving a entity, the unilateral declaration of independence will not benefit Kosovo.
UNMIK will remain in the province, while a new EU mission will not start.
The UN will now feel itself, and divisions will be divided within the EU.
The Balkans will still face instability.
Court supports Turkish president proposal to elect the public
The Turkish Constitutional Court, which is considered the rest of the prostitution, decided on Thursday a surprise decision.

"I will be held," said Constitutional Court vice-president Hashim Kilc. [Getty Images]
The Turkish Constitutional Court stopped from the government on Thursday (July 5th), making a referendum on constitutional amendments that would allow the country to elect the president instead of parliament.
The court voted in the case of 11 members of the court.
"The referendum will be held," court vice-president Hashim Kilc told reporters in front of the building.
The vote will likely be held on 21 October.
The law was dismissed by the party, when Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, a candidate of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), did not get a two-thirds of support in parliament.
The law envisions the voting of the president for the election, as well as the mandate of the head of state has been reduced to five years, and the two rounds of border.
The current mandate of parliament is reduced to four years.
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the AKP and his post in a simple clash with the AKP, has sparked the law, but the bill was approved by parliament.
At the same time, the president also appealed to the Constitutional Court, along with the main opposition Republican Peoples' Party.
The decision came only two weeks before the July 22nd general elections.
The AKP, based on the secular order of Turkey and the Islamic ideology of Islamic ideology, is under way.
They organised a series of protests that participated in millions of people.
Participants in these demonstrations called "Republic rallies" have transferred Turkish flags and protested the AKP with the slogans "Turkey", secularism.
The Constitutional Court, considered an important element of the secularism, was surprised by the decision.
Some media say this is a sign that the war between the secularists and the AKP is at least a time.
Now the Turkish people are not willing to choose the head of the state, but the 70-year-old population will decide whether this is the new president of the country.
Under the law, parliamentary members elected on July 22nd must elect the president within 30 days.
However, the president will not be possible by the end of the vote.

The local elections in the village of Arandjelovac, except of Belgrade on Sunday (April 25th) attracted the greatest interest of the public and media, while many see it as a sign of the country ’ s political career.
The elections for the first parliamentary assembly showed that the Serbian Radical Party (SNS), still part of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) in May 2008, has become a popular political option.
According to the first results, the SNS won the most votes (26.1%) and finished five per cent in front of the ruling Democratic Party (DP).
The opposition Liberal Democrats, who supported the government &aposs initiatives, won a single seat.
The DP is still a majority in the Arandjelovac assembly, if a coalition with state level partners.
While the bloc, which has gathered around the DP, the bloc could wait to get 21 seats, the opposition could stop 20 seats.
"The electoral results in Arandjelovac showed that citizens voted in a pro-European government and support the parties that have created the ruling majority in the state level," Nada Kolzija of the DP said.
Branko Ruzic of the Socialist Party also discussed.
"I expect the Socialists to be created in Arandjelovac with the state level," he said. "The Socialists are in parliament with the Democrats.
In the elections in Arandjelovac, the SP established a coalition with two smaller parties and won 14.24% of the vote.
They said "the victory" was very early to talk about the possibilities of a coalition ".
"The most powerful political party will be better for the talks, and I think that in Arandjelovac -- and I think it is the Serbian Progress Party.
"They have not been able to seek the votes and avoid the law," he said.
Nikolic said the SNS will decide whether to negotiate with the ruling Democrats and will decide whether the SNS will decide on Arandjelovac.
"If I recognise the judges, they will never be able to negotiate."
The Serbian Radical Party, a key parliamentary force in the past, will likely be represented in the Arandjelovac assembly.
Radicals hope that the resumption in a polling centre would allow them to overcome the 5% election threshold when they need 60 more.
President Dragan Todorovic told SETimes that the party is still a coup and violation "that the SNS is still caused.
"We expect our leader Vojislav Seselj to return from The Hague by the end of the year, which will further strengthen our political stance," Todorovic said.
The opposition has signaled the public to call early elections since February.
Petar Stamatovic, a Belgrade pension, believes the elections in Arandjelovac are reflecting a reflection of the citizens' ability to change the government in Serbia.
"The Progress Party is now the most powerful party in Serbia and this should be proven by early elections," Stamatovic told SETimes.
Many, such as students Milica Zivkovic, do not agree.
"I believe that this government should be given a chance to complete its mandate by 2012.
"I don ’ t know that a early elections will be able to provide."
Tadic rejected all early elections.

Several weeks ago, Romania, Georgia and Azerbaijan signed a memorandum of understanding the basis of a key project to transport the Caspian gas to the EU market in Bucharest.
The project, organised by LRI (Azerbaijan Georgia), aims to diversify transport routes, as well as reduce dependence on Russian gas.
The memorandum was signed by Romanian Economy, Trade and Business Minister Adriean Videanu, Azerbaijan Industry and Energy Minister Natig Aliv and Georgia Energy Minister Aleksander Khetagi.
The signing of the memorandum came after a three-year round of talks.
Imza parties agreed on the establishment of a project in Bucharest, which will preserve a feasibility study that will be taken before the start of construction.
Azeri gas from Georgia and Romania will be distributed to EU consumers.
According to the Memorandum, natural gas will be transferred to Georgia &ap91; the Black Sea coastal port of the Black Sea.
Following the shifts of gas here, Romania will be transferred to the Charter port and will be distributed to the European market with the national pipeline system.
"Romania will not replace the RI Nabucco," Videanu said. "Romania will insist that the DRI will insist on the list of priorities of the EU."
Videanu said that the LRI, which is now valued between 2 billion and 4 billion euros, is the most effective and most effective gas transport project that continues to build the southern Europe.
He added that the project could tell Nabucco before Nabucco, because political obstacles have been completed.
Videanu described the signing of a memorandum of understanding with his Azeri counterpart as a "historic incident".
"This is an important project for all states around the Black Sea," he said.
Romanian President Traian Basescu described the signing of the agreement as "equal for all three countries, but also an important step" for the EU.
According to the Romanian news agency Mediafax, the capacity of the LRI is about 7 billion cubic metres of natural gas annually, but the 2 billion cubic metres of cubic metres will be on domestic consumption in Romania.
Last year, Azerbaijan produced 23.5 billion cubic metres of gas and plans to increase it to 28.5 billion cubic metres.
Azerbaijan is 2200 billion cubic metres of natural gas reserves, he said.
Romania consumers about 16 billion cubic metres of natural gas annually, while 11 million people are being met from domestic production.
Greek debt crisis sets Europe
Spanish credit rating was the third country in Europe on Wednesday, with the debt crisis in Europe.
It is a proud of concern in Europe.

Spanish credit rating has feared fears that the debt crisis in the eurozone is expanded. [File]
European and IMF experts are trying to reach an agreement with Athens -- and high-level officials from the EU continue to expressed their commitment to assist Greece 'clearing -- could be broadcast to the debt crisis.
Standard & Poor & P & (S) credit rating agency said on Wednesday (April 28th) that Spain has dropped its long-term country rating from "AA", while the fourth largest European economy is possible.
The announcement came a day after the company declined Portuguese rating and reinvited Greece to fall its long-term and short-term debt status.
"Together," the OECD head Andox Gurria said on Wednesday. "This is something like the Esya [.]
We have to learn you that we have to stay in order to stay in life, "he said.
Council of Europe President Herman Van Rompuy called on leaders of the Eurozone to take part in the debt crisis -- an emergency summit and around 10 May -- to assess the debt crisis.
Following the rating of three members of the 16-nation eurozone over the two days, investors are concerned about the European debt crisis, while EU policy analysts have also been under a major pressure to ratify a huge bailout package for Greece.
Under an agreement reached in Brussels last month, Greece will receive bilateral loans from other Eurozone countries and financial assistance from the IMF in the last quarter, if the financial markets do not get loans from the financial markets.
Greece must receive 8 billion euros in order to repay the bonds, which was on May 19th.
However, Prime Minister George Papandreou complained on Wednesday that the most interested rates from his country are "at all aspects".
Papandreou called on the EU to "avoid a" response to the European and world economy ".
The Eurozone financial institutions, including those in Germany and France, are said to stop 70% of the Greek debt, while European officials are willing to avoid a possible representation of Greece.
Such fears and safety in the eurozone were sold on Wednesday to the lowest level of the year, compared to 11,3131.
"The Eurozone has no doubt that the European Central Bank (ECB) is determined by the IMF to ensure the stability of Greece and the stability of our currency," French Integration Minister Francois Baroin said on Thursday.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also called for accelerating efforts to rescue Athens after talks with IMF Executive Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn and ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet in Berlin.
"[The Greek government] and] talks with the European Commission and the IMF must be accelerated," Merkel said. "We hope that the talks will be completed in the coming days, and Germany will decide on its commitment to help the package."
The German public opposes any rescue plan for Greece.
Greece must submit a detailed budget plan for 2011 and 2012 to gain bilateral loans, Merkel said ahead of the key regional elections in the province of North Rhine-Westpisia on 9 May.
According to media reports Wednesday, Greece will now receive aid from the eurozone and the IMF in three years as part of the agreement, which is currently discussed.
The part of this will be provided to Athens this year.
According to the AP, Germany, the largest economy in Europe, will meet some fifth of its assistance.
EU Economy and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn voiced confidence Thursday that the talks would be completed "in the coming days", and promised details on the bailout package would soon be announced.
In Brussels, Rehn told reporters that the aid package would "allow Greece to provide a sufficient balance from financial markets" due to financial markets. "I want to understand that this is not only because of Greece, not only because of the financial stability in Europe and the world."

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is recognised as the world &ap91; largest] centre for tourist tourism, and hundreds of thousands of losses, margineers, mountain and mountain clothes come to the country.
The London Preet, French Geographic and the latest National Geographic, who also advised BiH to search, is only one of the media agencies that advised BiH.
Dutch Thierry Joubert described BiH as a "fundamental" in the area.
Joubert was allowed to stay here and formed the Hungarian Tourism Association to support BiH tourism.
"BiH is seeking to live as well as tourists, foresees and tourists, Tara, Neretva, Una."
Sutjeska, Vranica, Bjelashnica national parents, Lukomir and Umoldajan are also valued, "Sutjeska said.
"I see a positive thing on our country," said Safet Husic, who is aware of the disappointment that BiH has a wartime country.
However, Husic also voiced concern that BiH should "protect its natural beautiful behaviour and learn" to leave it into a natural disaster ".
Dragan Tesic argues that the public is aware of the tourism potential of BiH, but the government does not do enough efforts.

"I know our networks' beautiful, and I know that I should not accept the natural beautiful beautiful behaviour of our politicians.
In addition, it revealed "the funeral of the swimmer" in Europe and the prominent losses, "he said.
Others see tourists' safety and lack of infrastructure concerns, as well as doubts of restaurant tourism.
"This is unfortunately," Ivan said. "You can never know what we will be able to learn in the front of the stock, while we will not go to the heart."
BiH has accelerated the work of cleaning its weapons, and this is a question whether Zdravko Vasilic is still a problem.
"In the past, a Slovenian death and the defendants were in the Jahorina Mount," Vasilic reminded.
The tourists, however, praised the country &aposs efforts to boost the sector.
"Bosnia and Herzegovina has reinformed its infrastructure and managed a great business.

This country has the most beautiful art and culture in Europe.
I went to Bosnia for four years ago and I am very good.

UN Security Council Special Council for Kosovo
The 15 members of the UN Security Council condemned the attack last week that two Kosovo Serb teachers were killed and four injured.
(Independent - 19 / 08 / 03; UN, Serbian Government, AP, Reuters, AFP, Radio B92, RFE / RL - 18 / 08 / 03)
The UN Security Council held a special session Monday (August 18th) to assess the latest situation in Kosovo.
All 15 members of the agency condemned the attack last week that two Kosovo Serb teachers died and four injured.
Voicing concern that violence in the province has been at large, participants said, stressing that extremists should not be allowed to undermine the future of Kosovo.
The meeting took place on August 13th, after a attack near the village of Gorazac in the western country, Serbia-Montenegro.
Speaking to the government, Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Kosovo Co-ordination Council President Nebojsa Covic said UNMIK is satisfied with the failure of an international prosecutor to bring the suspects to justice.
Covic also promised that Belgrade has full support for the process.
"The only reason for the attack on young people is Serbian," he said.
The goal of the attack is to show that Serbs should leave the region and that there is no multiethnic society in Kosovo, Covic said.
He called for an effective and determined measures to guarantee the fulfilment of standards, including full implementation of the Security Council Resolution 1244.
Welcoming the accusations that Serbia-Montenegro leaders will remain willing to the country ’ s peace process, US Ambassador James Cunningham said the attack also condemned Kosovo Albanian leaders' participants in the Kosovo Security Council, including participants in the genocide Security Council, should be punished, and the continued efforts must be made to be fully implemented to justice.
The "Standards" have repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly said, adding that the Kosovo status issue will not be discussed without a deal on dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.
Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Zivkovic said the latest violence would delay the start of direct talks.
In an exclusive news, UN police spokesman Dand Chiell confirmed a new attack on Sunday in a Serb village in Gorazazrevac.
He called the "intimidation movement" as a result of the armed persons' village.
Still, children were reportedly targeted.
Chiell also said there were several car cars, including ethnic Albanians in the attacks, and some passengers have been praised.
In Belgrade, meanwhile, a week after the two armed men allegedly attacked near Pristina, the Serbian nationalist hospital, allegedly destroyed the attack.

The new border police will have 3,000 members.

Earlier this month, Macedonian police took over security control of the country ’ s border with Greece.
The move was part of efforts to reach Macedonia into the EU and NATO standards.
About 650 members of the new Administration Policy will ease the 250 km southern border.
Speaking at the extradition ceremony, Defence Minister Vlado Buckovski said Macedonia is one of the last few countries that have been protected by police officers, instead of police officers.
Parliament Speaker Ljupco Jordanovski described the new service as one of the basic aspects of national security, saying it is one of the conditions for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
According to Macedonian Army spokesperson Zoran Sekulovski, the police plans to hand over all border control by the end of 2005.
The eastern border with Bulgaria by the end of this year will receive control of the border with Albania in early next year.
The army will transfer control of the northern border with Serbia-Montenegro by the end of 2005.
The border police are training at the Police School in Skopje.
According to the interior ministry sources, the force will have 3,000 training police officers and will also include professional soldiers who will be ordered in police operations.
The new intelligence systems, telecommunications equipment and vehicles will spend about 7m euros.
The most difficult challenge is seen as a border with Serbia-Montenegro.
The agreement between Skopje and Belgrade has been signed and has been recognised in international context, but not yet undermined.
In addition, Kosovo officials have also appealed to a part of the province ’ s border with Macedonia.
According to Kosovo Prime Minister Bajram Rexhepi, the border is true outside a river near the village of Debalda.
During a recent visit to Skopje, Rexhepi announced a commission would be formed to resolve the issue.
"I can say that both sides are willing, because we have to live together with neighbouring," Rexhepi said.
The EU has allocated 1m euros to help the Macedonian border.
Studies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia Without Benzer Progress
The sanctions were closed to the decline of pension salaries and expenses in Banja Luka. [AFP] Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia could be said to have changed in different places on the road to the EU.
By Beth Kampschror for Southeast European Times in Sarajevo - 17 / 03 / 03
Semsa Tranka, a total of 83 United States, is not foreign.
Tranka is easily easier to buy money after the payment of telephone and electricity bills. The 72-year-old season is a spot, he said, adding that women will have to buy those who have to buy the poor.
"It is not a case, but everything was five or ten Mark," Tranka said at the Sarajevo response Breka station.
One of them 'writers, some of the book is helping him.
Apart from this, you are the best.
"We are not alone, but not all of them in the field, and all of us are pushing.
"There is no money that will get some of us," he said.
Tranka 'problems are not only with people who live in the mafia, but also with pensions in neighbouring Serbia-Montenegro and Croatia.
Otherwise, the time has not been able to reviews Yugoslavia, when the pension rates have received.
However, Yugoslavia has been part of a day.
The sanctions have now been the citizens of new countries who live with difficult population.
According to Zoran Anusic, an World Bank pension expert in Zagreb, Croatia has become a better position since the launch of retirement reform in 1995.
Croatia is now doing "bad" in the pension system, Anusic said, adding that the country could create an example for other new states.
The pensions are the average of 235 Dolar annually.
Though there is no lot, it is time for time.
The reform is on track -- the surprise payment rates of companies who pays pension payment increased to 90 per cent.
The approach of the Croatian pension reform points to a simple reputation with Serbia, with Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, as well as the "excellent" pension system in Serbia.
"I do not want, there is no law on judicial reform," he said.
Serbia has a job, and the unemployment rate in the country (40 per cent) are seeking to work in unregistered companies that do not pay taxes, health or pension payment.
The average salary of pensions in Serbia was 110 Dolar as of November.
Following more than two years ago, former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milojevic entered pensions within major expectations, but a social reform of the ruling coalition Government has been put forward with reforms.
The situation has caused pressure to support the Serbian budget, he said.
"This business [is] a job that the government is ready to do, and this issue is a matter that should focus on the reality," he said.
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the state is not the state, but the two governments in charge of the state are paying pension.
The average salaries in the Federation, which is better in the Federation, were 106 Dolar.
However, pensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina (RS), Republika Srpska (RS) can only get 66 Dolar a month.
Even the amount of the minimum amounts, but in the time this year, it has not been able to exercise.
"[Pension wages] have not been low in Albania," RS Pensions Association President Rade Rakuli told Radio Free Europe (Free Europe) in December.
Rakuli added that pensions in the RS are only 35 per cent of the average salaries, but that rate is in Croatia and Serbia at 50 per cent.
The reduction of pension salaries in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the High Representative for BiH, Kevin Sullivan Sullivan, says.
"It does not be allowed to leave Ali and give the Vice," Sullivan said. "Because the institutions have to comply with the establishment of more than the details of the discovered by the IMF.
Sullivan also says pension institutions have to pay hundreds of thousands of people who are no longer pension companies.
Agriculture and mining companies have created an important part of the Bosnia and Herzegovina economy before the war between 1992 and 1995.
Authorities, which are still at large, are selling their payments to pension funds.
The Federation Vice Deputy Fund Director Bakir Majic said at least 3,000 companies do not pay pension surprises.
The only one can protest that the pensions will be able to send their families abroad -- as well as for the money they will be sent from the Western Union, which is now in both governance units.
Jozo Lilyjanic of the Federation of Pensions said that 70 per cent of the pensions that have already been transformed from 200 surrounding Mark a month are unlikely.
"This is unrealistic, because the pensions are in the biological borders of the biography," Liljanic said, adding that the pensions are unacceptable as a "unacceptable behaviour".
The situation is more complicated, with refugees returning.
In the past, Coko Klivkovic, a pension of Serbian officials after leaving Sarajevo from Sarajevo in 1992, was worried.
He returned to his house in 2001, Federation officials refused to give a pension pension.
First pensions can require a pension payment from other leadership on paper.
It is a economic obstacle that would block the transformation of the situation.
The church system may also cause more young people to go to one or other governance zone, because these people fear the pension payment payments for other management.
The International Crisis Group has formed a proposal for the management of responsibility and transferring the state to resolve the problems.
Therefore, pensions are targeted to return to their homes, unless they will pay pensions.
The responsibility for the two governments to assume responsibility will be more complete, more precedent, and surprises will be easily easy.
More surprised surprises, such as Semsa Tranka, could provide more transformation of the salary of pensions, which could be transformed into a few months.
"Everybody will be better," he said.
However, no one can be good or better? "Tranka asked.
Greek Cypriot Minister: New Cyprus Talks to Be Because of April
The consultations on a new Cyprus initiative could soon begin talks on UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, sponsored reunification plan.
Officials, however, warn that a success should be made sufficient to avoid further prevention.

"We have to ensure that we do not guarantee the Cyprus issue because of a solution to the Cyprus issue and not a good negotiation framework," said Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister George Jakovu. [AFP]
Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister George Jakovu said on Wednesday (March 30th) that consultations on a new Cyprus peacekeeping initiative would likely be finished after the Turkish Cypriot presidential elections on April 17th.
The talks, which is expected to send several months, will be confident that negotiations on the reunification of the divided island will be confident.
"The talks will likely be in the start of the talks," Reuters quoted him as saying on Wednesday.
"We have to guarantee that in our way we do not have a crisis because of the Cyprus issue and not a good negotiation framework," Jakovu said in April. "
During talks with the previous Cyprus peacekeeping initiatives, a mediator in the north of the UN has been convinced with Turkish Cypriots in the southern Cyprus.
There are no direct consultations between the two sides.
The latest effort to resolve the Cyprus issue with a UN peacekeeping plan ended in April 2004, when Greek Cypriots rejected the proposed agreement.
Although the majority of Turkish Cypriots accepted the UN plan, only the Greek Cypriot part of the Mediterranean island joined the EU on 1 May.
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has made it clear that if the possibility of an agreement is weakened, a new round of negotiations would not start.
Annan met with Greek Foreign Minister Petros Molyviatis this week, calling for restructuring efforts to reunify Cyprus.
Both officials agreed that serious preparations should be made.
"This time we should be happy," Molyviatis said after a meeting with Annan in New York on Monday.
The UN president wants to see the plan as written by the Greek Cypriots' criticism, Annan 'spokesperson, Fred Eckhard, said on Tuesday.
"It is expecting that it will be able to get.
"I want to be confident that they are simply in the restructuring of the negotiations," he said. "There is no success."
Putin met on energy and investments under Belgrade visit
The Russian prime minister, who visited Serbia, has been very simply pushed.
Do you hope that the country will be able to hope more than Moscow in support of the future?

The Serbian people were certain when they are expected to be from Moscow, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was on the hearing of the indictment.
Putin arrived in Belgrade on Wednesday (March 23rd) to meet with President Boris Tadic and other senior officials.
Hundreds of people gathered in front of the Serbian House for talks to seek Russian leader.
As the Putin, Belgrade and Moscow went to play between Red Star and Zenana youth football teams, domestic fans have begun to say "Kalinka" of Russian song ", and commemorates the message of tolerance.
The pharmaceutical outcome was 1-1.
In recent years, Russian influence in the country has increased by significant investments such as Gazprom Neft 'bought a majority stake in the oil company, and plans for the South Stream gas pipeline project to pass Serbia.
Investment methods and economic co-operation were among the first in the agenda of Putin.
Putin confirmed that Russian companies would support Serbia &
Serbian construction workers, meanwhile, will take part in preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
"We want to benefit our Serbian partners from broad experiences on construction of tourist facilities," Putin said.
Tadic said that the South Stream project will be implemented in the coming years, adding that the pipeline is crucial for all Europe.
While the NIS has been profitable, Tadic said that Gazprom has begun to turn its investment in the company, and that both countries want the NIS to be active in regional markets, and said he expects additional investments in the Pancevo oil refinery.
Tadic voiced hope that Serbia has provided a loan of 200m euros to deal with the global economic crisis and supported Belgrade on the Kosovo issue.
According to political analyst Vladimir Goati, however, the public must not see Moscow ’ s capacity to help the Serbian economy.
"Russia has been doing its own problems, and it is not true to wait to help Serbia -- if it wants to do so far," he told SETimes.
The Russian administration has shown that it is higher than the economic and political capacity, and causing expectations to increase, "he said.
Goati believes the most important alliance in Belgrade 'relations with Moscow is energy.
"The importance of the visit of the South Stream pipeline for Serbia, which is very important and I think the importance of Putin," he said.
One of the key issues the visit was the EU integration process.
The Russian leader reiterated that Moscow does not worry any concern about the Serbian request to join the bloc.
"We will monitor the process of European integration, in order to damage Russian relations, and we will work together," Putin said.
Serbia is committed to entering the EU, but "co-operation with Russia is part of its strategic interests of the country", Tadic said.
"I think the EU can solve energy problems without co-operation with Russia.
Serbia will be part of the arrangement. "

The new establishment of Macedonia, the Ministry of Information Technologies and the Ministry of Information, is responsible for the country to bring public administration in line with EU standards.
Deputy Minister Ivo Ivanovski told SETimes that the reforms and these reforms are the importance of Macedonia 'EU integration process.
SETimes: What are the main changes in the new public administration law?
Ivo Ivanovski: The law will take effect in April, and all public institutions have to submit our data on the ministry of ministries for the next three months, the number of employees, gender discrimination, equal employment and experts.
We can say that there is some form of public institutions.
This government will analyse public institutions to be more efficient, as the previous Macedonian governments.
This issue, which is important for us, will be one of the basic part of our activities in 2011 to meet the demands of citizens.
SETimes: What is the institutional changes such as No?
Ivanovski: In other ministries, we have passed a number of workers, the new BT and government ministry and now we have reached 144.
In this case, we will make serious and high quality reform more quickly.
The ministry will launch projects that will change public employees in three years to complete the business concept.
Our aim is to present a more efficient study with public institutions that respond to the needs of citizens and business and business.
In addition, we will promote public employees with BT technologies and practices and provide easier and efficient structures.
Most of the citizens will be designed from the time, when they will receive electronic.
We live in the Technological communication, we must comply with developments.
SETimes: How can you see the claims of the public administration has been politically politically?
Ivanovski: The fundamental goal of reforms in Idare is to rescue the administration from politics.
Macedonia needs a capacity to deal with political and economic challenges, as well as a quality and responsible public administration.
The new law envisions much higher criteria for public employees' employment.
We want to block the political intervention of the public sector. We are preparing to implement the criteria that are among the values of the European society, a precondition for membership.
SETimes: How do the government benefit from international experiences and resources abroad?
Ivanovski: Of course, international experience and resources abroad helped us find solutions under the new law.
In Estonia last year, for instance, we have been closing the BT reforms, which had more professional and efficient officers in Estonia.
We assessed the best practices in Macedonia.
They also provide more transparency.
Estonia has managed it by reducing the number of people in the mechanism to decide and leaving the human factor for a completely process.
We also reviewed the best practice in the United States and other European countries.
SETimes: How will the new system more responsibility for the officers in the new system, and how do you exercise?
Ivanovski: In the new law, the public employees will be more quick, but they will have to leave a new system that we have ordered the "balance".
In addition to the Standards, we will start working on psychological liberalisation and personal liberalisation.
The education situation and the average average average of the pace is part of the evaluation.
We also facilitated the process of interest.
As a public worker has not been able to do its job, the Idare Agency will be transferred as a conservative commission and will decide whether he will return to the job and return.
The long-standing functioning period will be significantly reduced.
In addition to evidence on the issue, a commission will be formed to decide whether the work is not responsible for the work, and the Agency will be able to take the decision that the officer will not return to the job as soon as possible.
Turkish-EU visas: time factor
Authorities say the opportunities abroad from the EU could have to enter the search, because of the tightened visa procedures.

Turkish citizens say they are awaiting for months to get a visa. [Reuters]
Nexhat Ozhi was unable to travel many business visits to the EU last year.
The situation, however, is not from its own insufficient profit, but has not been able to obtain visa.
"No time we have applied to the EU consumer, they do not have a way to visa procedures or at time," he said, referring to the visa process ".
A 46-year-old project manager at the Black Sea coastal coast, says he or business friends had to wait for more than two months when they want to meet with European partners.
"We have to learn all political interests of the EU and Turkish governments and have to think that the citizens have to think.
The citizens of Serbia, Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina can travel to Europe, while Turkish businessmen who want to participate in the fair will not be able to see visa-free visa abroad, "he said.
Turkish businessmen who have been awaiting at the European water for nearly a decade are now unprecedented.
Last month, EU interior ministers agreed to start talks with Ankara on the issue, but there is no obstacle: Austria, Cyprus, France, Greece, Germany and the Netherlands oppose the removal of visa liberalisation.
Meanwhile, Ankara says it will not sign a reunification agreement as long as the visa requirement is not removed.
"Turkey should not accept different treatment," the foreign ministry said in a statement.
According to Doc, D. Dr. Ulaklalal Doalp, this is the outcome of "a negative stance against Turkey".
"We have come from a period of questioning that the Turkish public can live as a partner of the EU." The EU interior ministers did not have a worse time to tell this impossible visa liberalisation, "he said.
The current policy has been obstacles in front of commercial relations, and a candidate country restricts free movement of citizens, Eralp says.
Meanwhile, the EU has allocated millions of euros each year as visas.
Alexander Burrich, professor of Izmir Economic University, is more optimistic:
"Turkey is currently in a huge situation." The EU can demand the visa liberalisation agreement between the visa liberalisation talks and a reunification agreement with the third countries in the past, as well as the visa liberalisation agreement, "he said.
Some groups such as students and researchers can be recognised for visa-free travel to some groups, and the business managers can be given a climate.
Although the European Commission has been aware of waiting a quickly progress on its implementation, it is important to support political support for the dialogue process, he said, that EU accession talks could win a new dynamic.
However, Nexhat Ozgium is very important for the day.
"If we have to wait more than a year, I can lose connections in Europe.

The National Security Council (CCNS) of Bulgaria (CCNS) met on Tuesday (February 15th) to discuss the national security bill, expected to be approved before parliament &aposs four-year term in June.
The new National Security Strategy (NSS) has been in force since 1998 and will determine its policies in a number of key areas over the next ten years.
Following a meeting Tuesday, President Georgi Parvanov said the Council has seen the proposed strategy as positive.
In general, the CCNS said the possibilities for a united national response to the risks of the new century, which is prepared as parallel for EU and NATO documents, the risks of the new century, threats and unacceptable national response.
It serves as a consultant, led by key government ministers and officials, security agencies, military commanders and the heads of parties representing parliament.
Other participants of the meeting with Parvanov, however, noted that the bill, approved by the government on January 6th, notes the lack of shortcomings and violations needed before the vote.
The board also decided that the NSS should be addressed on issues such as the final document, ethnic problems, the integration of minority communities, and the lack of tolerance and prevention of foreign currency.
According to CCNS, the strategy should be "more important to the fight against humanitarian crimes that threaten their lives, lives and goods".
The board also noted the need for removing economic and number of flights between Bulgaria and industrial countries, improving the standard of living, stopping immigration and modernisation of scientific.
The document will be a basic basis for national security and monitoring policies, including Bulgaria &aposs military doctor and participation in military operations abroad.
"It is important that the documents will be implemented by more than one cabinet," Parvanov said.
The leader of the opposition Democratic Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), Nizhda Mihailova, said his party plans to meet with different political parties to discuss the document.
Mihailova said the Bulgarian security strategy should be implemented in the basis of a compromise, because national interests in the country as a member of NATO and an EU member, could only protect this requirement.

With the May 6th elections in Serbia approached, tensions on the Kosovo border are growing.
Two Kosovo police officers, called Industry Binaku and Sami Bekiri, were arrested on Saturday (March 31st) by the Serbian jandal at the Merdare border crossing.
According to B92, Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that the two KPS Kosovo Police are "an impressive violation of the Military Technical Technology Agreement, signed in Kumanovo in 1999."
"How has the internal affairs in the middle of Serbia and what is the agreement," Dacic questioned, adding that "everyone who has been trying to violate the Kumanovo Military Technical Technical Agreement".
Membassies gave EULEX officials on Monday (April 2nd) to Kosovo, citing the relationship.
Pristina has suggested that the officers have moved to the Kosovo police in the responsibility area.
"The Serbian genocide and organised crime prompts the position of the Serbian state to the Republic of Kosovo and the attack of an attack," the Kosovo Interior Ministry said in a statement.
Kosovo President Atiff Jahjaga discussed the arrests as "a attack on the institutional and territorial integrity of the Republic of Kosovo".
The arrests were the last public of a series of arrests at the border, which cautioned Dacic "mutual measures".
Kosovo police arrested four Serbian Serbs on March 28th to stop election materials and voters' lists.
Kosovo police spokesperson Arber Beka told SETimes that the arrests are concerning Serbia ’ s attempts to elect elections in Kosovo.
Serbia will hold municipal and parliamentary elections on May 6th and said it would include some parts of northern Kosovo.
Pristina has opposed violence and said it would use power if it must stop the elections within its borders.
"We have a clear operation that the police should do in such cases," Beka said.
Kosovo police also discussed propaganda material, a organisation allegedly extremist in Vushtri on March 27th.
Police said the newspapers, including a car of five Serbs, have found the findings, Ljubske Novine.
Police found 38 pieces in Toronto, where the Ravna Gora Movement of ethnic Movement (Cetnicki Ravno Gorski Pokret) found in Toronto.
One of the five Serbs was detained in detention for 48 hours, without discrimination and division.
Even later, the investigation is under way.
Nevertheless, two Kosovo Albanian Albanians, including Metalurgy Union President Hasan AD, were arrested for allegations of abuse and drug trafficking, B92 reported on March 28th.
The Human Rights Organisation demanded on Saturday that the arrests should be released, and said Kosovo must facilitate the way for charges against four Serbs, four Serb crimes and host of prison by a EU delegation to Kosovo.
"The defined measures are not in Serbia 'interest, and Serbian police do not want to do so.
However, it is clear that such a situation will not be done without mutual measures.
If we want to compete in the proceedings, we do not promote us, "he said.
On February 26th, four of the police officers were arrested in Kosovo for detention of five Serbs, five Serbian and judicial bodies.
The three days were detained.
Dacic, who has been calling for the dialogue of Kosovo and has so far, questioned how the agreement on freedom of movement "if Serbs will be arrested every day".
"These are open provocation, and I cannot block the police to lose Kontall more obstacles.
However, if there is a mutual measures, we will be able to take place in the coming days, "he warned.
Kosovo Interior Minister Fisnik Rexhepi said the arrest of citizens by Serbian police is completely discriminated on political and freedom of movement.
"Kosovo citizens do not want to leave the state without any official activities in Brussels," Rexhepi told SETimes.
Kosovo Police have a difference among the political and European actions of the Serbian state, "he said.
EU mediator Robert Cooper said political problems should be resolved through dialogue and negotiation, as well as the provisional implementation of the laws.
"The EU expects both sides to fulfil their commitments during dialogue," Cooper said.
Parvanov to win Bulgarian presidential elections
Most Bulgarian people expect Georgi Parvanov to be elected in the second round of the October 22nd presidential elections.
However, polls suggest the second round of elections could be held due to low turnout.
(Focus News Agency, Standard - 09 / 10 / 06; Sofia News Agency, Vidi Den, Mediapool, Dnevnik - 08 / 10 / 06; Balkan Investigative Reid - 05 / 10 / 06; Angus Reid - 04 / 10 / 06)

The October 22nd presidential elections in Bulgaria are hoping to win seven candidates.
However, the second round of elections could be held a week after the turnout is expected.
According to the law, at least 6.4 million votes in the country must go to the polls, in order to declare a victory of more than 50% of voter support in the presidential elections.
Cvetozar Tomov, a columnist at the poll company Skala, said on Monday (October 9th) that it is low.
A survey conducted by the IS public opinion company suggested that the number of people who want to vote has dropped by 9 per cent since the beginning of the campaign, while the number of people who say they would remain in house.
Georgi Parvanov, who serves in two weeks of elections, continues to take a major stage, while 88 per cent of voters who can vote -- plan to vote or plans -- believe Parvanov will win the second five-year term this month.
Polls suggest the support for Parvanov has declined in the recent days, but the opponents still seem.
More than 35% and 37% of Bulgarians are expected to vote, which means about 70 per cent of voters' support.
However, six other opponents are likely to take the second round of voting on October 29th.
Volen Siderov, leader of the ultranationalist Attorney party, has 9% of all voters who are able to vote in the polls, or 22% of the possibilities that are likely to go to the polls.
Nebocho Beronov, 78, the head of the Constitutional Court, is third in the public polls, with 1% to 2%.
Beronov was nominated by Democrats, the Democratic League of Democratic Forces and other smaller centre-right parties.
Beronov and other nominator Georgi Markov have a little difference.
Sofia Mayor Boyko Borissov, one of the most popular politicians in the country, described Beronov as "at least bad", saying he supported Beronov.
In an interview last week, Borissov said the goal of support was to eliminate the possibility of Siderov to win the president.
Borissov said this would have a destructive effect on the country.
However, only 5% of the mayoral bodies are expected to vote for Beronov, while 46% of Parvanov, 12% of Siderov said they would vote for Markov.
The polls did not exist the possibility of changing the situation in the first round, but Parvanov and Siderov are expected to be a second round of votes.

He stressed the need to reach a "constructive solution" on the status issue.
"We should support the special envoy Martti Ahtisaari in order to reach an agreement this year and we must co-operate with us, we have to do with us," he said.
Sejdiu repeatedly reiterated the Kosovo Albanian side for independence and sovereignty.
"We believe 2006 will be independence for Kosovo," Sejdiu said.
He also called for a delay in resolving the status issue.
"With the principles of the Contact Group, the final status of Kosovo should be resolved in 2006," he said.
Ahtisaari suggested last week that the decision would be postponed.
The six-member Contact Group of Contact Group, a six-nation Contact Group of Contact Group, comprised of Serbia as the end of this year, he said, could be reviewed as a result of the election history of Serbia, France, France, Germany, Italy and Russia.
"This would mean that the proposal for preparation will be presented only after the elections," he said.
However, representatives of the Contact Group have been seeing to be unable to postpone the possibility of postponement since then, "said the representatives of the Contact Group in Pristina." We have not changed the agenda of the Contact Group on Kosovo, and we are determined to make our principles that Kosovo status should be determined within 2006. &qu
Now Ahtisaari has insisted that the postponement has not been postponed, "Reuters quoted Ahtisaari as saying on Monday (October 9th).
"The initial point of our truth with the Contact Group is resolved by the end of the year," Ahtisaari said.

NATO to help Greece at Athens Olympics' Security Caspirations
Following the latest terrorist actions in Turkey, Greece announced that the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens could ask NATO in preparations for security.
(Forum - 05 / 12 / 03; AP, VOA, Canada Press - 03 / 12 / 03; AP - 02 / 12 / 03; AP - 28 / 11 / 03; Reuters - 27 / 11 / 03)
Greece has suggested that NATO would play a more extraordinary way in security plans for the 2004 Summer Olympics.
The incident attacks in neighbouring Turkey last month sparked concerns that terrorist networks will attack during the Games.
Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos said on Wednesday (December 3rd) that Greece has established its military plan for the Olympics on a broad strategic plan for the Alliance.
Following a security meeting at the chairmanship of Prime Minister Costas Simitis, he said Greece could ask NATO in its plan to boost its capacity to fight terrorism.
However, the overall control of security operations, the Greek police and military forces will remain.
Speaking ahead of the meeting, Simitis said the authorities are reviewing the methods used by the inhabitant attacks in Istanbul.
"We tried to see any possibility of any possibility.
However, the latest incidents have shown some new ways, "he said.
Greek Defence Minister Yiet Papanton said visitors did not want the country to "leave Athens with the impression of a military force".
Speaking ahead of a NATO meeting in Brussels this week, he said foreign forces will not serve as a mission, but that NATO countries will keep their units to intervene with a major terrorist attack.
Terrorism "is not limited with a certain number of countries," International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge said last week, stressing that security has the first priority for the Games.
"Therefore, athletes, monitors or authorities must be able to exercise more security control," Rogge told reporters at a press conference. "In the Games, there is no more police and armed vacations, if they see it.
If you have, then we are satisfied with them in the army, "he said.
Greece has allocated more than 620m euros for the security of the Olympics.
In addition, the country has created a 200-strong unit of special education to deal with biological, chemical and nuclear terrorism, and is a list of chemical resources that any attack could be cleared.
In addition to full co-operation with the international advisory group of Australia, Britain, France, Germany, Israel, Spain and the United States, Athens has been tightening security and intelligence co-operation with the Balkan countries in recent years.

Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said on Tuesday (April 11th) that Belgrade authorities will take action to arrest key war crimes indictee Ratko Mladic soon and will hand over the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
The full co-operation with the UN tribunal in The Hague, including the surrender of former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic, is a precondition that Serbia must fulfil its path to EU membership.
Brussels has made Belgrade until April 30th to fulfil its obligation, and said talks with the EU could be suspended by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA).
"We are very close to fulfil this obligation to move forward on the European path," Kostunica said in a speech in Paris on Tuesday, following a meeting with French President Jacques Chirac in Paris. "We will do everything for Co-operation.
Serbia will do it until the end of this, "he said.
These remarks were the second speech by the prime minister in the past two weeks ago that Belgrade is committed to resolving the Mladic case.
Kostunica is facing a threat to the EU to suspend SAA talks, and pledged last month that the fugitive would be arrested and transferred to UN war crimes prosecutor Carle del Ponte.
Mladic was first indicted by the ICTY for the first time in 1995, because of his role in war crimes committed during the 1992-1995 conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
He faces two counts of genocide in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and the 43-month siege of Sarajevo, in addition to charges of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws and customs of war.
Mladic, who fought over the decade, has been widely believed to be hiding in Serbia, where he lives under military protection by 2002.
Among other issues discussed by French and Serbian leaders on Tuesday, the future of the Serbia-Montenegro state union was part of talks on EU membership efforts and the UN-led talks on the future status of Kosovo.
Serbian BETA news agency reported that Chirac wants to seek a long-term solution to all sides that are part of the French embassy in Belgrade, urging Chirac to impose legitimate interests in the Kosovo status talks.
Kosovo, which is still part of Serbia-Montenegro, has been under UN administration since the end of the 1998-1999 conflict.
Kosovo Albanians, who have created 90 per cent of the province &aposs population of 2 million people, hope the talks on the UN will result in full independence from Serbia.
Belgrade and Kosovo Serbs want Kosovo to stay on Serbia.
Reiterating Belgrade 'stance on Tuesday, Kostunica called for a "compromise" in the middle of independent Kosovo, which is in one side of the 1999 status quo.

"There are more serious actors in the market.
Investors come from abroad and are offering better fees, "he said.

Transparency International said on Wednesday (October 20th) that corruption is still widespread on the world, citing the consequences of the latest survey on corruption.
"Corruption in large public projects is a major obstacle to sustainable development in both developed and developed countries, and causing major losses in public funds to reduce education, health and poverty," Peter Eigen, head of the Berl-based corruption monitoring agency, said at a press conference in London.
The group shows that in 2004, the Corruption Index (CPI) showed that 106 countries participating in the survey have received a rating from 10 to 5.
According to a press release published by the group, Romania, Macedonia, Serbia-Montenegro and Albania have shown a high corruption rate.
Among these countries, Romania is ranked 87, along with the Dominik Republic and Iran. With 2.7 points, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro ranked 97 in the CPI, the CPI range ranks with Algeria, Lebanon and Nijagua. Albania ranks 2.5 points, with 2.5 points in Libya, Libya and Palestinian Golden.
"If we hope that the number of people who live in poverty by 2015, we are hoping to reach a serious fight against corruption in the public contracts," he said.
The group of Eigen estimates that the government has been registered in the world every year due to bribery in the purchase.
Romanian Justice Minister Cristian Diaconescu said that after the survey results were announced, Bucharest is seen as a signal to accelerating its efforts.
While better scores are ranked, all other SEE countries -- Cyprus (5.4) -- are among the 106 countries that range from 5 to 5.
Greece, which ranked 4.3 points, has 49th with Syria.
Bulgaria ranks 4.1 points, with Mauritius and Namisia, 54.
Bulgaria, Spain, Meksika and Kolombia have been in the group of "important changes" in the fight against corruption over the past eight years.
Croatia is ranked 67, with each score of 3.5, along with Peru, Poland and and Sri Lanka. Turkey, which ranks 3.2 points, shares Be, Egyptian and Fas 77.
Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked 3.1 points, and the CPI ranks 82.

The Ahtisaari plan is not "huge value"

UN envoy Martti Ahtisaari will submit report and recommendations on Kosovo on Friday (February 2nd).
Most of Kosovo Albanians expect the plan to overcome independence as a condition for the province.
According to Njomza Pevku in Pristina, the Ahtisaari plan is not a problem to call for "supervised independence", but key obligations that are important to the province.
"It is very important to know that Kosovo will be implemented and respect for human rights," he said.
The excellent friend, a student of political scientific scientists, agrees.
"I have a better life in Kosovo.
If independence insists, the solution is not very important, "he said, adding that Kosovo is not only for Albanians, but also for other ethnic communities.
"I think Kosovo will be a good place for everyone," he said.
Everything is not optimistic.
Another political scientist student Sami Saltrati is concerned that the international community is rising a successful state credibility, citing the conditions that do not be implemented by Kosovo &aposs overall.
One of the problems is the "double majority" of Serbian representatives in the Kosovo Assembly, he said.
"I think that this right that Serbs have the Serbs will create a state in the near future," he said.
He believes the proposal is difficult to satisfy both sides.
Nevertheless, the way to open a sovereignty to Kosovo is very important to avoid a future problem in the Balkans, he says.
"Kosovo Serbs need motivation," he said.
If we want to see some progress in the Balkan economies, an independent Kosovo is a good example.
However, we should not expect it to take place in a recent way, "he said.
Journalist Spe Kokaj is sceptical that the plan will bring a defined solution.
"If we will see our experiences in the past, I do not expect Ahtisaari to wait a huge value in his part," he said. "This will only be the next step towards the start of another process."
However, he added, the plan "will be a good missile for Kosovo, both sides -- Serbian and Albanians -- to be satisfied."
"It is good that the international community will take Kosovo on its agenda," he said.
While the UN envoy envisions limited sovereignty for the province, the Serbian minority has made significant autonomy.
Pristina will be able to apply for membership in international organisations and will manage Kosovo on the path of a UN official.
Ahtisaari described the proposal as "fair and supervised" in Strasbourg, France last week.
He stressed that the main goal is to ensure that all communities in the province can live in peace.
Croatia debates EU suicide boycott
Croatia acknowledged that the European Commission wants to put the customs duty exports a year.
This move sparked opposition parties, who said farmers and suicide producers would be damaged.
The government, however, argues the opposition is trying to win only political points.

The Croatian parliament recently moved to end the EU market, unlimited, customs duty exports, according to a requirement for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
The new customs duty exports have been set up as 180,000 tonnes annually.
The amount of taxes on this will be substantial.
Opposition parties have cautioned that the government would be bankruptcy due to the decentralisation of the three Croatian suicide factory due to EU demands.
The parties predict that the Croatian industrial industry will face millions of euros, and the biggest loss of farmers will be revealed.
Prime Minister Ivo Sanader has been dealing with criticism because he agreed to restrict.
The head of the Committee for Agriculture and Agriculture, Bozidar Panktic, argues that the new export code should not be less than 30,000 hectares of exports.
"The new suicide export huge will be bankruptcy with 180,000 tonnes of tonnes," he said, claiming that the boycott would limit domestic production.
Agriculture Minister Petar Cobankovic, however, supports the government decision.
Cobankovic says Croatia has exported only 120,000 tonnes of tonnes of tonnes annually to the EU, whereabouts that the husband will not be damaged.
According to Chobankovic, the export code will not jeopardise the production of exports, as Croatia has established good market relations with the European Commission.
Cobankovic says the agreement signed with the EU is really unless the opposition politicians are reminding Croatian supermarkets.
"The agreement is a better position that Croatia will not be based on the agricultural sector, but instead of its internal market," he said.
Therefore, Croatian producers are satisfied with the amendments, "he said.
Greek second bailout loan has 70 to everyone.
Greece has said the austerity programme will keep the country as well, but others say they are taking part.

Stavros Karetsis seems that Greece has signed an agreement with international creditors to obtain a second bailout loan, while his country seems to defend war criminals.
Thanassi Antoniou, who approached 83, says the government is doing itself in the half century, because the government continued to pull the pension.
Although the government says the agreement bails the future generations of the country, the Greek public fear that the standard of living -- 22% in the standard of living on the living rates of 25% to 32%, another huge drop.
Eight Prime Minister Lucas Papademos pushed from the EU-ECB Troika and pushed to pass the second loan package of 130 billion euros on the first bailout of the 109 billion-euro bailout, but the second package came more than the same austerity measures to avoid a deep blow.
The unemployment rate is around 21% -- 488% -- and more than 111,000 businesses have been closed in the short term, with estimates that this would be more flexible.
Parliament acknowledged that this year 'budget would be more than 3.2 billion euros, while the main objectives will be pensions, salaries, health and medicine sector and defence spending.
These are the conditions for the Eurozone finance ministries, while Greece supports the financial bloc, and they are trying to stop 100 billion euros as part of a Financial Directorate (PSI) agreement with reluctant investors, the Eurozone finance ministers said on February 21st.
"The situation will be difficult and more difficult," Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in a speech before the vote. "We are now working to work together with the decision on February 21st, with special sector intervention and banks' rating, but we have to work together with a safe framework, we need to work."
"We have to do everything outside the defence," Karkaletsis, the head of the Athens defence analyst at the European and International Analysis Centre for European and International Analysis and New Democracy President Antonis Samaras, told SETimes.
You can build a new economy, but if you can lose the Greek territory, if you can lose a precautionary candidate, "he said, promising to send a letter to Cyprus after 38 years of Turkish intervention, which is still divided and more expansion.
On Thursday (March 1st), police seized a factory in the north of Greece 'Committee in the north.
A Greek-language was injured with a former explosion and another worker to protest the job, and two people were killed. [Reuters]
"I am not only concerned, but I am confidence and people who have their families," Antoniou, a single office who helped him, told SETimes.
"Now I think it will be how to use it," he added.
Papademos said the new cuts are a decision to produce new cuts, but the alternative is fatal and collapse.
Venizelos, who chose the Gelir and real estate tax taxes, said the agreement will open the way for finding the PSI agreement and would benefit the country in the long term.
"Each proposal abroad can create security, uncertainty and cause traffic problems," he said.
Nevertheless, Samaras said, "With this new loan agreement, we have prevented the country 'disbursement of the euro … we fear social solidarity, at least for now," he said.
These artefacts did not affect the employees, but the salaries of the public sector has dropped by 30%.
Some private sector sector wages have dropped by 50% in order to ensure a decline in minimum wages, and some employees have dropped by 400 euros a month.
The soldiers reached an expensive point.
On Friday, a unemployed worker sparked a plastic factory in the Committee on a disciplinary factory in Commander, paving three people and left several hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundred hours before police surrender.
Pantelis Magalios, director of the business forum in Commander, told reporters that the attack was finished.
"We condemn the incident that should not be internal.
However, the problem is to think that weapons have taken this man.
The fact that this point is that unemployment and salaries are simply on the rise.
These are problems that we will continue to face. "
Aggelos Tsvetas, head of the Economic and Industry Studies Studies Research Foundation in Athens, said Greece is in the case of two female fears, with a repeatedly fears.
"This is a lot programme that will further deepen the crisis.
As these measures affect revenues and salaries, we are estimated by 3% of GDP -- instead of 4.5%, "he said.
"This, however, was not an agreement that must take the PSI to get a positive impact on the debt, especially in particular," he added.
Papademos believed that the economy could be able to get itself within 18 months, but the new growth ideas should not be done.
Pantelis Halmas, a economist at the University of Ioannina, said Greece is a long way to overcome.
"The problem of the austerity is a decrease of tax revenues," he told SETimes, noting that consumption expenditures have caused a 333m-euro decline compared to the figures in January 2011.
"This part is the only way to promote growth," he said, citing the government is unwilling to do so, as many Greek professional owners -- excavations, enthusiasts, architects and lawyers.
Researcher for English Research at the National Institute for Political Studies in Athens, English Research researcher Max Afouxenidis, said the measures will be successful, and they have caused a high number of young people who do not see the minimum wage and fewer.
"This fall will continue for years," he told SETimes. "This is a full part of the social interest we have.
The whole country has been disappointed. "If you do not show it, we cannot be able to say."

While talks on the new government coalition in Serbia continue on Wednesday (January 31st), the ruling Democratic Party of Serbia announced a series of conditions for Kosovo, which the country will agree to join the next cabinet.
The platform, sent by the DSS and a coalition partner in the January 21st parliamentary elections, has been sent to Serbian media, insisting that the new government should be "a top constitutional obligation" to protect the territorial integrity of the country.
The DSS submitted the document to President Boris Tadic on Tuesday, when consultations on forming the new government coalition.
The DSS announced public opinion on Friday that UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari will visit Belgrade to two days to submit his proposal for a solution to the Kosovo status issue.
While the details of the Ahtisaari plan were not announced, the plan is widely widespread expectation that Kosovo will be part of a road map that would lead to the path to the state.
The proposed proposal, which is still unchanged, will allow Kosovo to recognise Kosovo as a sovereignty state if they want to unilateral countries.
According to the Belgrade Beta news agency, the DSS-NS platform, "any country that decided to recognise the independence of Kosovo (Kosovo) should not understand that this would lead to serious consequences in its relations with Serbia," the DSS-NS news agency reported.
He said he would also allow Kosovo to apply for membership in international organisations such as the UN, the EU, the World Bank and the IMF.
"If any country or the international organisation accepts the independence of Kosovo and Metohija, the Serbian government will condemn the governments of all recognised countries in the international field that are recognised as legitimate and legitimate," the DSS-NS platform continues.
He also warned that if any NATO member states recognise Kosovo as an independent country, it would cause "serious inclusion of relations between Serbia and the Alliance".
Observers see Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica &aposs DSS move as a reduction of the chance of forming a pro-European ruling coalition between democratic forces in the country.
The DSS-NS coalition won 47 seats in the Serbian elections.
These results made Kostunica as the role of the new government.
The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS) -- the most voted in the coalition -- could unify the forces with the Democratic Party of Tadic (DS) in third place.
The circumstances that Kostunica &aposs party suggested are approaching its stance on Kosovo.
The DS and former Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic 'G17 Plus party said they are opposed to Kosovo' independence, but found a more active position on the issue.
The only Serbian party, which supports the independence of Kosovo, is the Liberal Democratic Party, led by former Deputy Prime Minister Cedomir Jovanovic.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) has decided to transfer one of its alleged claims since 1993.
The case against former Bosnian Serb paramilitary Radovan Stankovic will be sent to the war crimes tribunal in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), according to a UN tribunal &aposs three-judge commission on Tuesday (May 17th).
As the ICTY will complete all its activities by 2010, the tribunal officials said that some medium-medium-medical and low low cases in the Balkans will be transferred to national courts in the Balkans last month, in a bid to shift the case and intend to focus on top indictees. More than 50 indicted war crimes indictees are still at The Hague, including Ratko Mladic, and the ICTY is still at large.
"It is not the factors that have the responsibility of the defendants, nor the indictments in the indictment are not the factors that will take over the case of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national authorities," the ICTY said in a statement Tuesday.
Stankovic, 36, was first indicted in 1996, with seven other individuals indicted for war crimes committed against Bosnian Muslim and Croats in April 1992 after Serbian forces committed Foca. On 9 July 2002, SFOR soldiers were arrested and sent a separate indictment to The Hague in 2003.
The indictment convicts four counts of genocide and violations of the laws and customs of war, as well as four counts of crimes against composing and personal discrimination against him.
In the beginning of the 1992-1995 conflict in BiH, Stankovic serves as a soldier in the Miljevina Tabury of the Foca Taktian Takiqi, and a Bosnian Muslim group, according to UN prosecutors.
The indictment suggests that August 1992 and several other soldiers were responsible for the house of their homes, and that at least nine Muslim women and women were left and sexual abuse.
"Several civilians were killed during the accusations, and were discovered and sexual abuse," the AP quoted the indictment as saying. "Most of the people who were involved in the architecture and sexual abuse of women, including vulnerable living conditions."
Stankovic "The role of these irregularities consists of a certain Serbian soldier to combat at least two women, women and women, or sexual application, and one of the repeat in a three-month period.
UN judges decided to accept the prosecution 'proposal to transfer BiH authorities after assessing several factors, such as the BiH law on the ICTY Charter and a fair judge.
The judges made a statement by the ICTY that "enough measures to protect witnesses" and "no death sentences" will not be given.
Under a decision Tuesday, Stankovic will be sent to BiH within 30 days.
The indictment and the prosecution has 15 days to appeal to the continuation decision.
UN prosecutors want to take over several other war crimes cases to BiH, Reuters reported.

The difference will reach 5.5m euros in the start of the June 25th parliamentary elections in Bulgaria, State Department Minister Dar Kalchev said on Friday (May 13th), adding that the difference will be met with the budget deficit.
According to Kalchev, the foreign affairs ministry has more than three lawmakers needed to organise the vote of Bulgarians living abroad.
The main reason for the overall overall overcome is, he said.

Only 500,000 Bulgarian citizens are believed to be leaving the country in the past 15 years.
The interior ministry will finance the industry under the latest electoral law, which envisions police officers' salaries to ensure safety of the Election Day.
At the same time, another amendment is expected to provide a bill of 30 per cent to 40 per cent to 40 per cent from the blueprint.
The party will now take part in a unique plus of coalition and independent candidates.
The political force and the number of candidates, which has been registered for the boycott of the vote, will depend on the number of candidates.
The Central Election Commission (CEC) has so far rejected six parties and coalition parties, including a communist party and the Bulgarian State Youth Party.
As of now, 20 parties and the coalition parties, including all represented in parliament, are guaranteed to participate in the next month elections, while seven other forms are still awaiting the MSK decision.
Nevertheless, the new surveys showed that the Bulgarian Socialist Party has become a top of 25 per cent voter support.
According to the latest public opinion polls conducted by the Alpha Research agency and the Risk Regulatory Foundation, the National Movement for Simeon II (NMS-II) is in power with 15 per cent to 19 per cent.
Other parties that are likely to bring the 4 per cent threshold to the parliament, are the Movement for Democrats and the Movement for Democrats for Democrats, as well as the small partner of the current ruling coalition, led by the NMS-II, which is likely to cover the seat.
According to the Alpha Research survey, 22 per cent of the participants are still undetermined, while 19 per cent said they would not vote, while a survey showed by 5 per cent in April.
The CEC, meanwhile, decided on June 24th that no public opinion should not be announced.
The electoral results will be announced only after 8.
The strategy for this foundation will be given to the pop music literature literatures that have been linked to certain parties, as well as 250 to 500,000 euros in penalties.

On May 7th and May 8th, Macedonia was transferred from border police from the border police, including Kosovo, to the border police.
The mission, part of the US-Administration Project, has to warn European standards that border security should be the mandate of military forces, instead of the police.
So far, border police have taken responsibility for the north, southern and eastern borders with Serbia-Montenegro, Greece and Bulgaria, respectively.
In September, the border with Albania will be under police control.
The 221km long border of Serbia-Montenegro is the longest border of Macedonia, but the six-border crossings and Petrovec Airport contains the Serbia-Montenegro border.
The border, which is considered the most powerful checkpoint, is being used as protective for drug, smuggling and weapons trafficking.
More than 400 special border police officers, which enhance the security of the border, are comprised of former army members.
International standards need to be replaced by three to four police officers to four km of the border.
KFOR, which has taken responsibility for the Macedonian police and the border with the Kosovo entity, has established communications, including communication co-ordination of the control co-ordination of the Kosovo side and will be able to work better.
Authorities in Serbia-Montenegro have also been reported as official.
"I expect a good co-operation with the local population and authorities [to continue] the increasingly municipal authority through the decentralisation process," said Macedonian Defence Minister Jovan Manasijevski. "The improvement of local public security is a priority in meeting border security tasks."
The transportation of border control began from the Tetovo region, while Kumanovo was in the last time, it was untrue to Skopje.
The region, which was part of this border, took place in 2001, but the government, international organisations and civil society organisations have made a series of activities aimed at boosting confidence and revival.

However, the city could help protect this architect cultural heritage.
By Marian Tutui for Southeast European Times in Bucharest - 23 / 09 / 03

Some of the major buildings caused to be given the Calea Victoriei island of Bucharest were built on the Calea Victor.
Among them, Romania (1888) is the National University of Capital (1895) and the CEC Palace (1900).

He will begin from Calea Victoriei and Nichita Stanescu.
Although the plans have taken broad praise, implementation continues to be postponed.
The two churches on Calea Victoriei have achieved more success in restoration projects.
The Korzulescu Church (1722), one of the mountains Constantin Brancoveanu, notes that Gheorge Tattarescu has the 19th century restaurants.
The small Stavroeos Church (1722) is considered the most beautiful church of Bucharest.
The church includes external fear teachers, including Prens Nicolae Mavrofat, a 18th century seats from the 18th century.
The restoration of the Stavroeos Church has also contributed to donations by the US embassy.
Ceausku has a bad person of the losses that Romania has made its historic capital.
Critics argue that some of the architects that encourage Ceausku to implement excellent plans are still operational in the post-communist period and undermined the city &aposs beautiful behaviour.
However, Bucharest residents can protect the architectural heritage of their cities, such as the residents' plans to restore the Dracula Parkan, near the medieval town of Sighisoara.

Following a two-day meeting in Sarajevo, political directors of the Peace Implementation Council stressed that the OHR could end its mandate in BiH, rather than the targets and lack of conditions.

"They call for the OHR to continue to remain in BiH," said BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric. [Getty Images]
During a meeting in Sarajevo this week, political director of the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), the Office of the Office of the High Representative (OHR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) decided to stay in the country as long as the five pharmaceutical and two conditions set at a PIC meeting in Brussels on February 27th.
Political director who completed the two-day meeting in Sarajevo on Wednesday (June 25th) stressed that signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) two weeks ago, the OHR has fulfilled the first two conditions for the transformation of the European Union (EUSR).
In a joint declaration, however, the BiH political leaders called for meeting the remaining criteria.
In addition, the government must resolve the issue of public goods and army property.
The country must recognise the status of the Brcko First and complete the Brcko Niimetal Award.
In terms of sustainable sustainability, a Financial Assembly is among those who do not have been created.
In addition, the government must seek a national war crimes policy to ensure the rule of law.
The PIC Steering Board reiterated that the government must meet the second requirement, warning full actions of the Dayton Agreement and take a positive assessment of the PIC on the situation in BiH.
The Russian delegation rejected a statement, insisting that the OHR has insisted on a certain date for its mandate.
"Other PIC members acknowledged that Russia would be completely disappointed in its stake, not always on the results," BiH High Representative Miroslav Lajcak said after a statement.
Some officials, however, are demanding that the OHR will be released without the post.
"They called for the OHR to continue to remain in BiH," BiH Prime Minister Nikola Spiric said at a meeting of the PIC.
Haris Silajdzic, president of the BiH Party and BiH presidency member, stressed that most of the party leaders participating in the meeting are opposed to the end of the OHR.
Representatives of the PIC members and BiH institutions say constitutional reform is necessary and that operations in this direction will begin after the October local elections.
"However, I do not think the OHR has been linked to the new constitution," Lajcak stressed.
The next meeting of PIC political directors will be held in Sarajevo in November, he said.
In Greece, Credi Seeks Special Exchange
Greek banking institutions have given the lack of credit control, which is based on private debt growth, while Greek households are in economic way.

The loan and credit card procurement climate that Greek banks are not falling, but increasingly in the number of debts.
The banks are unfortunately, whether their clients can meet the necessary payments.
A total of personal debt in Greece has made confidence that the GDP is only a small scale of the GDP, but there is no clear figure on the number of banks' bankruptcy.
The private debt situation in Greece has reached crisis rates.
The bailout of the markets has been made since 2000.
According to official national statistics, only 10 per cent of Greeks are designed, while 60 per cent of the winner is spent, more than 30 per cent of the remaining 30 per cent -- loans and credit cards are being easier.
Two of the ten credit card owners have frozen loans, and only a minimum payment amount.
About 15 per cent are being implemented annually.
Tahat companies live gold.
Authorities, who have been kept by banks in order to tackle the expensive debt, are under pressure to repay their debts to deepen their debt.
If such barricades do not produce results, it is the right to take measures, such as the law, seek to co-operate with the executive officers in the case of conflict.
There are 21 companies operating in this area, and the number is growing.
The basis of the problem is that banks do not have information about the excessive debt situation.
Banks are needed to contain all personal credit or credit card accounts, but some estimates use a joint Beyar and Kara Liste system, a database that includes only a quarter of data.
The system does not have information about the papers, which could cause the increase of credit rings, which has already been located to the clients who are located to large households.
Only the List system includes new literature loans and credit card debts.
Therefore, a person who has a ID labour debt can receive a new loan from another victims who live.
In both cases, the overall debt situation is easy.
Teorik, a Greek citizens can receive loan or credit card in each country.
The loan has not been almost almost never been facing a point of the average citizens' increasing debt.
Dutch Relations Referred to Cyprus

Cyprus, which has been recognised as "no waste flights" in the Mediterranean, will live on Saturday, with the most critical day in the past 30 years.
In a two-day referendum on the two sides of the divided island, the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots will vote for a peacekeeping and reunification plan, which was described as "Annan Plan".
The plan aims to resolve one of the most important international problems and ensure that a unified Cyprus join the EU on 1 May.
The Annan Plan is a 9,000-page document that is still being discussed, despite the revised review.
The diplomats and international experts have not reached a compromise that the plan envisions benefits such as each side.
The EU is uncertainty that the plan will not be able to get a legal basis.
For now, however, the only problem will not be approved by the ratification of the referendum.
The latest public opinion polls suggest that there is no possible answers from the north.
In a survey by the Centre for Public Research and Education in northern Cyprus, 62 per cent of Turkish Cypriots pointed to the plan.
Meanwhile, a survey by the newspaper Policy on April 14th showed the plan between Greek Cypriots declined every day.
The vote was 71 per cent on April 14th, 62 per cent and 54 per cent on 16 April.
However, this trend does not mean the rise of the votes.
The number of Greek Cypriots supported the Annan plan was 12 per cent on April, 12 per cent and 17 per cent on April 16th.
At the same time, an undetermined electoral census was a spot. On April 14th, undecisions on 17 per cent were able to 29 per cent on April.
It is clear that the referendum will affect international policy if the results are not.
The United States, the EU, Greece and Turkey are the best outcome of both sides.
In this case, both communities in Cyprus will become an EU member on 1 May.
This will eliminate an obstacle that Turkey is in front of its accession to the EU.
As a result of the referendum, the Greek Cypriot side will be responsible for resolving the problem, if the referendum confirmed the polls.
Analysts say such a result could lead to the removal of the barricades on northern Cyprus, which only recognised Turkey as an independent state.
If the plan refuses to reject the two sides, the southern Cyprus is expected to repeat the referendum after it entered the EU on 1 May.
The worst scenario for Turkey would be accepted by the Greek Cypriots, but it would be rejected by the Turkish Cypriots.
This could lead to both Turkey and the exception of northern Cyprus.
Croatian investors turned their observers to the market in 2008
Croatian investors have revealed a seven years of growth process in relatively bigger new markets.
Following the end of last year, many of them are at a doubt in 2008.

In Croatia, debt and investment funds have become a popular vehicle for long-term investments.
The market, however, continued to increase growth over seven years, has entered the stagnation process in late 2007.
Miroslav Jelicic, who also founded the Aureus Investment company with Kristijan Floricic, shared expectations for the future of Croatia.
Southeast European Times: Following the stalemate in the Croatian investment funds at the end of 2007?
Miroslav Jelicic Purko: I have nothing in the world.
Once only the planned investment targets, there is great importance and here.
The stalemate in the Croatian investment funds is something expected after the seven years of the seven years of growth rates in the sector.
It is a normal situation for the market.
The outcome in Croatia was to replace the things of insufficient investors, who have experienced the debt and easier money.
SE Times: What is the basic reason that the market entered by the end of 2007?
Purko: There are many reasons for the stalemate, the Kosovo issue is a slow transition process, the issue of compliance with EU standards and a lack of transparent market.
The fast growth in valuable networks that enabled the profit of profit could be seen as another reason.
In November 2007, the November 2007 elections were one of the effects that caused to see the market. [Getty Images]
SE Times: How did the November 2007 parliamentary elections were one of the effects that caused in Croatia?
Purko: The parliamentary elections will always get stability because of certain political options that will create future developments.
Therefore, the stalemate in the market was affected in all factors last year, and the positive change has been affected.
The stalemate is also the stagnation in the United States, the largest economy in the world.
SE Times: Do you think that when the people in Croatia are generally seen as general, the information on the debt and investment funds in Croatia is more than the information that the EU has the persons who have the EU?
Purko: Every day in Croatia, many people are beginning to see their shares as a long-term investment.
Croatian investors now have a coastal coach.
This geography could be positive or negative, but many have been closed with a panic.
We do not know that investors in Croatia do not know that they have more or less information from investors in the EU, because the market is more new.
Of course, every new situation in the new markets -- especially in the Croatian market -- is training for investors and prepared for future work.
SE Times: Is the Croatian market began preparations to join the EU in 2009, as planned?
How do they reflect investment funds in the sector?
Purko: We can say that Croatia is approaching EU standards in terms of transparency, pension systems, the fund sector and interim studies.
In the past five years, positive changes have been very positive.
I think that Croatia will not be an example for the eastern European countries.
SE Times: How would you benefit Croatian companies or in the sector?
EU membership could be beneficial for Croatia in agriculture and farm sectors. [Getty Images]
Purko: I hope that the Agriculture and energy sectors are to prevent other areas of the economy.
Croatian companies should be translated to the EU because there are problems in food and energy sectors such as food and energy in other parts of the world.
Croatian resources are very big and the country must use these resources.
It is not possible to reach consequences that have not been inefficient reforms.
The future of the Croatian economy and success depends on authorities in the administration.
These authorities must create a platform that would allow Croatian companies and the country 'economy to develop.
SE Times: How will the Croatian investment funds continue to address markets in other former Yugoslav republics?
Purko: Croatian investment funds are to the region, with a large part of the pipeline.
However, I think that Croatian funds are slightly sold, because Slovenia and North European funds have discovered the region very early.
With this market, the market risk should be included in the price account.
SE Times: How do you see the experiences in this market?
Purko: We have faced problems such as the lack of adequate transparency, and a serious price change of prices, but these problems have to invest as they invest.
Aureus Investment will continue to seek new opportunities in regional markets, as well as the effects of the threshold in the spring.
Regional market prices should also be supported with a developed institution and the EU standards.

A police investigation has been launched to find responsible for the biggest military scandal, known as Croatia, to finalise their responsibilities.
The scandal was explosive by a secret documentary document that includes the name of 50,666 wars.
The list was published on April 6th at a special website that was established in order to disrupt these information.
The data included military and private conservative units, the name of the Special Forces and intelligence units and intelligence units, and the service of the 1991-1995 Anavatan War.
Analysts warn that such huge information could lead to the judiciary and use the basis of the basis and other decrease purposes.
When the scandal was explosive, the website was so many visits.
It is said to be the United States, while it is not known for the identity of the people who pay the park.
Marko Rakar, a former deputy of Croatian bloggerer, website expert and Croatian President Ivo Josipovic, has been charged with questioning police during the first 48 hours of the scandal, but was not charged.
"I am completely convicted," Rakar told reporters in his return to the accord.
Several internet forums have come to police on their own right, he said, following possible suspects in the list of possible internet forum.
"This is a recipient.
In the end, I have been wrong and I have not shown that I have been able to see, and I am serving, "he said.
Damir said the military has no need to reserve the past, but does not want to live at border crossings with neighbouring countries.
Most of the public think the document is hidden to protect military personnel who served in the war without the war.
The Gazi status has a higher pension, the Croatian Gazi Fund, and financial support for business.
The nine government ministries have been discovered as war crimes.
Some prominent persons who have not served in the war have shown their names in the list.
A debate on whether the rest was announced and not announced, has been under way in Croatia for years.
President Ivo Josipovic dismissed the list, not under the current conditions.
"I have the police duty.
I still support the idea of the newspaper list, but it should be accomplished and accomplished with appropriate arrangements, "he said.
Polls to Judge Small Bulgarian Democrats
According to one of the latest public opinion polls, Bulgaria will remain at 50 per cent of the general elections on June 25th, because the smaller parties are the most smaller parties in Bulgaria, with more than 60 per cent of voters are difficult to enter parliament.

A new public survey executive director of the Bulgarian MUND said on Sunday (June 5th) that the license of registered voters in Bulgaria plans to join the June 25th parliamentary elections.
Mira Yanova said these figures would be injured to smaller parties, particularly former Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, who could likely be able to overcome the 4 per cent threshold for the parliament, especially for the First Bulgarian Democrats (DSB).
According to Yanova, however, the centre-right DSB, which has reached 60 per cent of the voters' participation, is likely to overcome the barrier.
The same situation is also applied for the ultranationalist Ataka coalition, which has been supported in recent years.
The survey, organised by talks with 1,213 voters over the last five days of May, acknowledges that none of the five parties and none of the coalition could not provide a majority of the majority.
The previous polls suggest the majority is difficult.
According to the MUND researcher, 50 per cent said that the elections would be fully participated, but said it would vote for 16 per cent, but no one would decide.
Three per cent of the participants said they are still undetermined on whether they will vote, while 20 per cent plan to vote.
According to Yanova, a 65 per cent voter turnout will vote for the Coalition for Bulgaria, led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), after the restructuring of actual votes, 38.2 per cent of the vote.
The 2nd National Movement of Simeon, which is currently in power with 23.1 per cent, will be monitored by the Bulgarian People 'Union (MRF) and Freedoms (MRF), with 11.6 per cent of the vote, with 8.8 per cent and the 5.9 per cent vote.
According to this scenario, the DSB will only 3.8 per cent of the votes, and the Auta coalition will win 2.7 per cent.
According to these results, the MUND envisions the road distribution of the 240 seats in Bulgaria: 103 or 104, NMS-II for Bulgaria to 63 or 64, UtDF 32, 24 and BRF to the MRF.
The BSP said they will still try to form a coalition government even if the majority of the benefits.
The MRF, which has joined different coalition governments over the past 15 years, is the most possible partner of the government.
Meanwhile, Boyko Borissov, one of the main figures in the NMS-II candidate list, announced his candidacy was suspended.
Borissov was not shown, but a day after authorities said that the decision was targeting the lives of Borissov, and reports that the Serbian underground had failed to success.

Addressing the meeting, observers said Croatia is better than Bulgaria and Romania, which completed half of its road to EU membership talks.
However, the country must show strong efforts to meet the basic political criteria, co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal and allow refugees to turn their homes, he said.
"Croatia is aware of the integration of the Union, freedom, democracy, human rights and the law, and we are determined to respect these principles," Racan said.
Croatia, a country that has been isolated by former President Franjo Tudjman, has developed relations with the EU since the Racan forum, which took power in 2000, when it comes to power.
Simitis said Greece will transfer its application to all EU members in April.
The European Commission (EC) could start accession talks, if the application does not appear any option, the European Commission said.

Kosovo to boost privatisation
Kosovo hopes to speed up the process by passing the regulations.
By Linda Karadaku for Southeast European Times in Pristina -- 21 / 09 / 11
Ferronikel in Glogovac is one of the most important privatisation in Kosovo. [Reuters]
The privatisation process in Kosovo is based on the UNMIK administration, established by the Kosovo Trade Agency (KTD).
The company continued with the Kosovo Privatisation Agency (KOD), established by lawmakers in 2008.
So far, 295 public enterprises have been privatised, including Ferronikel in Glogovac and the 650 new bodies have been established.
"We believe the privatisation process is the first step towards economic development, which means stable jobs," KOD spokesman Ylli Kalohi told SETimes.
The KOD has 578m euros in traffic funds led by the KOD, while 537m euros came from the privatisation of social and public enterprises, he said.
The remaining part was achieved by the sale of goods through liquidity.
Following the privatisation, the sale price is 20% of workers.
According to Kaloshi, there were around 43.5m euros in money for employees, and the KTD has been disbanded by a 15-year period, and the 28m euros were disbanded by the KOD.
However, the agency acknowledges that there is no full success in the privatisation process.
According to officials, one of the problems is the state of various public enterprises to Serbia and the contracts signed at the time.
Another obstacle is slowly slow.
"This is not achieved the progress in the process of decentralisation," he said. "This is the resources of a company, which has been in force for about three years.
There are around 600 companies that will be formed, which means that this process will be 30 years. "
"Therefore, the legal changes are necessary, and the process is working on this," he said.
Among the key amendments, the process is a law on the Privatisation Agency, which aims to accelerate the process and replace UNMIK regulations.
Parliament acknowledged the package and is expected to give a final approval.
Kosovo analyst Ibrahim Rexhepi told SETimes that social and public enterprises have come to the final phase in privatisation.
The two most important problems are the Trepca complex and the operational Trepca complex and the Brezovica tourism complex.
"The political problems and Serbia 'owners' claims are reflected in the second round," he said.
Rexhepi believes the government must sell a part of public enterprises to eliminate the state treasure, but also to avoid the state monopoly in certain sectors.
However, the sales should take steps to eliminate economic and social problems, analysts said.
The Kosovo Institute for Reconstruction Studies held a debate on the privatisation process in April and concluded that the privatisation of privatisation is an urgent issue of amendment and preparing new laws.
However, participants stressed, the process should be transparent and should not be repeated such as the laws in Ahtisaari Paketus.
The Kosovo Privatisation Agency, Ilkin Yasa, was part of the package.

At the beginning, Serbian Parliament lawmakers began debating amendments to the current consumption law.
Among the most important changes, rates, smoking and consumption tax are planned.
Finance Minister Mladjan Dinkic said the price of three intellectuals will not feel the effects of the increase of public fuel tax, because Serbia 'Austeur Industry (SAS) will meet its own reserves.
SAS director Zeljko Popovic also supported Dinkic 'remarks, but stressed that new goods will be shared as a result of competitiveness by Lukoil and other companies in the Serbian market.
The minimum producers have not met the increase of consumption tax on tobacco products and invited consumers from their own budget.
The Serbian media wrote that British American Tobacco (BAT) and Philip Morris, who bought tobacco factories in Vranje and Nis last year, were prepared to respond to the government decision.
The contract signed with these companies was a condition for consumption laws approved by the previous Serbian government, the Democratic Party of Serbia and other parties in July.
Former Finance Minister Bozidar Djelic, who is in the markets with BAT and Philip Morris, said the existing law envisions consumption tax, enabling the consumption of the EU and World Bank policies until 2010.
The first increase in the tax tax is planned in 2005.
"In this way we have made a platform that would allow the plans to invest in our country, to provide an income commercial conditions.
Philip Morris, the head of the president of Philip Morris, said there was attacks by some analysts that the Nis Tusbishoi Industry had a high price for consumption, because it is guaranteed by commercial stability. "
"I think that such decisions will be very bridge for our country without consulting the three largest investors in our country, Philip Morris, BAT and Lukoil," the former minister said.
Djelic and other economists say the proposed amendments are falling with the government to attract foreign capital.
Experts say investors have changed the foundation of attracting investors to Serbia, while also undermining the basis of investment.

Women [in Turkey] have been disappointed from the election lists, which women say their prospects for better representation in the parliamentary elections on July 22nd.
Women cannot be represented at enough levels, the increasing interest of women in politics and participation in Turkey, but still a key problem in Turkey.
Women are expected to receive around 30 seats in the 550-seat assembly against the 550-seat assembly, which they are currently in the next week.
Turkey ranks 127th in the world in terms of women in parliament.
In the past two months, women in Turkey have organised huge rallies to support secularism and oppose former Islamist Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul 'candidacy.
Women rights advocates and NGOs have created one of the most dynamic and effective parts of the Turkish community.
Women 'rights advocates are now a major problem that women are represented in parliament, they say, is a major problem that enables efforts to overcome gender differences.
If a better representation of the parliament is a better representation, the executive killings, violence against women, and more progress in improving the role of the society and participation in all areas.
"Women should be a campaign for the Military and Support Association (KADER) in March?" Women 'Association of Education and Support (KADER) has launched a broad support and promised that political parties will take more.
"However, the final election lessons have a great disappointment for us," said Hula Gulbahar, a prominent women rights advocate and KADER head. "But political leaders who have the right to the Lises have the right to decide, have no other asylum."
The ruling Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP) has nominated 62 women in the election lists, but only 12 are elected.
Although the main opposition Republican People (CHP) won 55 candidates for the lists, only 13 are expected to be elected, according to the KADER.
The third party, the Democratic Party (DP), which is expected to overcome the 10% threshold in the general elections, has only 55 women candidates in the first three positions.
Gulbahar says the majority of the party leaders are personal friends or colleagues, despite those candidates.
"These women are only to show the list.
Political parties have avoided their list of women NGOs and women rights advocates.
Even if 50 women in the next parliament are 50 women in parliament, they will still be limited to our efforts to eliminate gender differences, "he said.
Gulbahar said the efforts will continue with a campaign to boost the political party structures and local politics.
Russia suspended arms agreement, disappointed NATO

The end of the agreement was approved by Russia and three other former Soviet republics so far.
NATO member states refused to ratify the agreement because Russia does not fulfil its obligation to attract troops from Georgia and Moldova.
Moscow opposes any connection between the two former Soviet republics, with the CFE agreement.
Following the decision by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbbev, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbev, who signed the document, announced Washington 'action, as well as plans to establish missile bases in Poland and and the Czech Republic.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov voiced hope Saturday 'hopes that the move would convince the Alliance to approve the agreement, while a Russian military analyst described the Putin' decision as "very damage".
"Of course, NATO countries do not comply with all the requirements, even if they approve the adoption of the agreement," Alexandror Golden Free Europe / Liberal Service told the Russian Liberal Service. "
The Russian move is expected to end the other measures envisioned in the agreement, as well as on mutual inspections and exchange on weapons.
Many European countries, including the Czech Republic, Romania and some northern countries, expressed dissatisfaction with Moscow 'decision Saturday.
After a meeting last month, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called on Moscow to return to the contract of a key agreement.
"I do not believe there is an alternative to the relationship of a multi-NATO relationship, because I cannot do without a key partner such as Russia, and I can not say that Russia will not be unable to NATO," de Hoop Scheffer said.

Bosnia and Herzegovina Relations Approve Studies to US Army Army
Aida Basic and Thessaloniki Ramic have yet to live in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) as refugee.
After leaving the right to learn and citizens in the United States, the US Army returned to BiH to work as environmental.
By Dusko Jovicic for Southeast European Times in Tuzla - 09 / 06 / 03
Many Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) citizens feared their homes with fear that they will not be able to take more time during the conflict in the country.
In December 1992, Aida Basic, who was symbolic, died with a 12-year-old children in Sarajevo where he was ready to go to the United States.
"I was ready for a month, but I am not able to go without the anonymous.
In the end, a journalist was simply insufficient and convinced me to take me, "he said.
In the United States, Basic faced a lot of challenges in the list because he did not speak to English in the first round.
"It is very difficult for me.
"There is no huge step on English," he said.
Furthermore, his mother decided to deepen the school.
Moreover, Basic was very frequent in the software, and Chicago has lost to the Lake Forest Forest in Illinois.
Basic, who chosen the part of the English, wants to be a journalist.
However, the latest in universities, Basic, Fort Polk, invited a invitation to work as the US Army peacekeeping mission in Louisiana in the education exercise.
The experience has caused a business offer to work in BiH, a weapons pollution that enabled the US Army for intellectual support for the US Army in BiH, Norway Grumman.
"Everything was a good opportunity for me.
There are many jobs, but we are learning much to learn in this job, which has an opportunity to return to BiH.
We are doing a good thing for the army and people, "he said.
Ramic, 26, faced similar challenges at the age of BiH in 1992.
"Following a year in the United States, I started to speak to English, but I have restricted the mountains," he said.
Ramic, however, has made good competencies and did not have the International Business Report from the New York College in Pennania.
"It seems an international person and I want to work in a American company that operates excessive presence.
I had the opportunity to work in BiH through a newspaper in New York.
I am proud to be part of the mission.
"I have always been returning to BiH and I want to work as a career," he said.
Basic and Ramic are part of the refugee refugees who returned to BiH to work as an environment for the US Army.
Special losses show that refugees from the country during the war will be able to return to countries in a better future if they are given the right opportunity.

During a visit to Sarajevo last week, Serbian President Boris Tadic urged Southeast European countries to support the Serbian national team in the World Cup.
It will not be a problem for Republika Srpska (RS), where the majority see the Serbian team as its own team.
The rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH)?
"We will keep Serbia in South Africa, if BiH is not involved.
We have a close neighbour, this is a similar zone and their duties, "he said.
Zvonko, from Mostar, said he would keep Serbia because he is a Serbian brother, but because the forum Marko Pantelic is a favourite.
The basketball is always under the effect of the national and ethnic conflicts, which caused to leave the former Yugoslavia.
The stones are frequently frequent.
In late April, for example, 40 people were injured in incidents between Sarajevo and Siroki Brigeg fans.
The fans were killed in October 2009 and a person were killed.
The majority of Sarajevo fans are Muslims, but the Siror Brigeg fans are Croats.
"In the early 1990s, the official policy and nationalism in the former Yugoslavia were frozen," Psychologist Srdjan Puhalo told SETimes.
Nevertheless, fans in international context could be ready to destabilise their differences in regional solidarity.
"I do not believe that relations between the three people in BiH have changed [significant], but there is no alternative," Puhalo said. "You are France, Italy, Britain, or the United States?"
"We are in the beginning of a new process... both politics and sports.
Of course, we are more closely closed and we have a relationship with us, "he said.
RS Deputy President Adil Osmanovic, a Bosniak, has acknowledged Tadic 'proposal and said he would support Serbia at the World Cup.
"I am beautiful, I am like the Brezilia football.
Now I will support the Serbian national team because it is the only former Yugoslav country that joined the World Cup, "he said.

Turkey opposed on Wednesday (June 9th) with Brezilia of the 1929 Security Council Resolution, which has implemented new sanctions due to the Iran nuclear programme.
The two countries recently signed a nuclear tour agreement with the Tahran regime and are willing to continue these diplomatic initiatives.
"We supported the idea of resolving the Iran issue [since the beginning of the nuclear dispute], so we voted in the Security Council on Wednesday," Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.
More than 12 other members of the Security Council voted in the sanctions, while one of the Lebanon -- was optimistic.
Earlier in a telephone conversation with US President Barack Obama earlier, Erdogan briefed Obama about Ankara 'decision to appeal.
He also decided to send a high-level delegation to Washington on June 14th.
"Turkey does not target the United States," the daily Hurriyet, a Ankara International Studies Research Organisation, quoted Mehmet Yurriyet as saying. "Turkey has to stop the agreement as a requirement for a reconciliation."
The decision, however, would be "complete", he added.
"I will not survive that we are disappointed by the vote today," US Undersecretary of Political Affairs Bill Burns said in a press release Wednesday.
Obama described relations between his country and Ankara during a visit to Ankara in April 2009 as an enormous partnership.
However, the two countries have sparked a dispute over how Iran will be closed with the nuclear threat.
Other members of the Washington -Vienna Group, France and Russia -- with Turkey and Brezilia -- have not been able to disperse concerns of the commission, which the mediator of Brezilia, said.

Ankara says the sanctions have affected the Turkish economy, citing trade.
"If the sanctions are abolished, Turkey and Iran can be able to increase its trade," Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said in an interview with Kanalyst late Wednesday.
Nevertheless, diplomatic resources in Turkey say the country will implement UN Security Council decisions, as it is not a permanent member of the Council.

More than two weeks before the parliamentary elections in Kosovo, voters have been launched on Tuesday (October 12th). Since 1999, the fourth edition of the international community has been seen as a major test for efforts to build a multiethnic democracy in the province.

According to a survey by the Kosovo Institute for Education Relations, about 25 per cent of registered voters in the province could stop the polls because of the ongoing economic problems and the disappointment of political parties.
Kosovo Serbs have threatened to boycott the elections, citing security fears.
Such a move, the British daily Financial Times (FT) reported on Tuesday that the international community could not decide whether the province is expected to start talks on the final status of the province, but the confidence of the ethnic diversification of democracy in Kosovo.
While the majority of ethnic Albanians are pushing for independence, Kosovo Serbs want the province to remain part of Serbia-Montenegro.
Many local leaders want the ongoing international efforts to continue for five years.

Serbian government divided over natural gas agreement
The century agreement for Serbia has been dealt, but the energy agreement with Russia and Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS) sold to Russian Gazprom in Belgrade, and causing major debate in the Serbian government.

After several months of talks and debate, Russian natural gas company Gazprom bought Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS) on December 24th to 400m euros and invest at least 500m euros in Serbian company.
The same day, Serbian President Boris Tadic and Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev signed political agreements on the reconstruction of the South Stream gas pipeline from Serbia and the reconstruction of the Serbian Banatski Dvor gas facility.
Although Serbia was presented as an agreement for the century, the energy agreement with Russia was removed from Serbian government members, due to some parties' damage to the country.
Deputy Prime Minister and G17 Plus party leader Mladjan Dinkic said Gazprom has closed its oil company under the real value of the real value, adding that the country could reach 800m euros from the sale.
The Serbian gas pipeline has not been guaranteed, Dinkic said, noting that the party is likely to withdraw from the government because of disagreements between the ruling coalition partners.
However, Tadic said, the decline in the world oil prices has dropped the value of oil companies, including the NIS.
At the same time, he believes the document signed with Russian counterpart is enough to guarantee the United States will build a natural gas pipeline that would change Serbia 'economy.
Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic said the South Stream gas pipeline "is very important for the two countries, as well as Serbia, a strategic foreign investment point of the Balkans and that regional gas supplies would turn into a central point".
According to the agreements, however, the natural gas pipeline will not be clear until September 2009, when it comes to Serbia.
According to the global economic crisis, some analysts doubt that the Russian South Stream can build all.
"The transport of the Central gas pipeline is very positive for Serbia, and the country will strengthen its geographical position and extend its annual pipeline," said French Ambassador to Belgrade Jean-Francois Terral.
Serbia also expects the reduction of natural gas prices if Russia is really built the South Stream pipeline.
Belgrade currently holds significant amounts to natural gas from Hungary.
If the new pipeline applies from Serbia, the gas distribution could also win money.
Albania faces heavy energy crisis, workers and jobs
A key part of the Albanian people is elected on the day because of the electricity shortcomings of the daily life.
The country cannot meet the request of hydropower plants from the communist era, while it cannot close the deficit from abroad.

As the Albanian Electricity Energy Council (KESH) revealed power restrictions on Sunday (November 6th), when energy restrictions in both rural and rural city.
Over 7.30, electricity has been allowed to be given by 16,000.
In rural areas, a hours ago, the homeland began on 6.30.
Electrical cuts continue to change both hours before 16,000.
Some residents who live in some residents have been elected from the day to 18 hours.
"Albania has to take such measures because it affects serious labour power plants," KESH said in a statement.
In addition, the energy crisis reflects the poor situation of hydropower plants, the country 'only electricity resources and the lack of foreign investment in the sector over the past 16 years.
The hydropower plants, built during the communist regime, were never invited to meet increasing consumption.
Over 30 per cent of the rise prices and consumers have questioned to pay their bills.
Albania and Greece have imported about 5m euros annually from Macedonia and Greece, but it is much more than enough.
The country has met with other countries, including Ukraine.
"Our rebels are negotiating because we are planning and surprising for Ukrainian officials.
Of us, they think it is to provide electricity during the period of December.
We will come from Ukraine from Romania and Serbia, so we are talking with these countries on electricity transportation, "he said.
"I remember the people who have a large part of the middle of the Games, which are electricity," he said.
However, we are facing a power situation and we cannot mean our work to solve it, "he said.
The consolidation of electricity has also been sparked more violence in Albania, which is not only three hours ago stations in Albania, which is poor to water water water.
The situation could be destroyed on Albanian businesses.
"We live with the problem.
I am not in the case when most of them are elected, I am not going to meet the energy costs as a businessman.
How we will do, and what will happen? "he asked.

In Turkey, government end stalemate
The stalemate on flights in key military positions has led to judges' criminal charges.

Observers claimed that the Turkish government has abused the judiciary process to win a victory in the latest bridge over the fans.
Following a week after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on key positions in the armed forces, a compromise candidate was announced on Monday (August 9th) that a consensus would be appointed as commander of a consensus.
Ordal General Erdal Ceylanoglu was appointed as the post of the chief staff of the general staff.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been opposed to the Igun candidacy, following the military 'election, General Hasan Ilymic, who called on Erdogan to tackle the ongoing investigation against a computer indictment against the Justice and Development Party (AKP).
Following the deadline, Order General Iff Kohaner opened the way for the extradition of Chief of Staff General Staff General Ilker Basbug, who was retired on August 30th.
Most of the observers say the outcome is an important victory in the fight against the AKP, which is based on Islamic politics.
The military seems itself as a protectorate of the secular constitution of Turkey, and has been intervened in politics, including transferring governments.
Usta journalist Hasan Cemal said the incidents last week were "historic importance".
"This could be described as a step towards normalisation of Turkey," Cemal said on Monday.
"Democracy -- or even military workers -- is the last civilian authority," he said.
However, others claimed that the government does not abuse the judiciary process to block candidates' appointment.
A week ago before the meeting, a court, which was indicted by a coup plan against the government in 2003 -- Baljz kod -- ordered the arrest of 102 army personnel, including 11 high-ranking officers, who are waiting for extradition.
According to military regulations, no officer who has been arrested for the arrest cannot be removed.
Following the outcome, a second court cancelled the arrests of 102 officers on the 102 officers, and many observers were seen as a constructive compromise by the government.
"These are manipulated," said prominent political commentator Jusuf Canada.
"How is a court to arrest a arrest warrant for 102 people -- ten days before a military meeting -- and after the crisis is normal to cancel the same decision," Canada told SETimes.
"I think this is a clear violation of the judicial independence and not acceptable," he said.
But Orhan Kemal Cengiz, a leading human rights lawyer, told SETimes that the meeting was a victory for the rule of law.
"All military officials are sending a message that if they will be involved in such plans, this will be a price.
"It is very important that the defendants have not been appointed," he said.
Cengiz said the arrest of officers before the meeting was not believed to be politically motivated.
However, he added, the purchase of orders is likely.
